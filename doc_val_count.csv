"It also does show, as you point out, that AR can be really great. And we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. And so we're investing, and the number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers' products like PokÃ©mon. And so that's the reason why you see so many iPhones out in the wild right now chasing PokÃ©mons.",1
"For details by product, I'd like to start with iPhone. We sold 35.2 million iPhones, an increase of 4 million over last year, representing 13% growth. As Tim mentioned, iPhone sales grew well across all three of our entry-price, mid-tier and lead product categories.",1
"Steve, we're not going to get into products or product transition. However, we've taken what we've learned from last quarter, and we did see a number of encouraging signs. Luca talked about the number of countries that we saw double-digit growth in during the quarter, from Japan to Brazil to India, some even stronger numbers than that in Russia. So there's a number of countries that we saw strong signals from that perspective.",1
"Great, thank you very much. Regarding your revenue guidance for September, it's up about 10% sequentially, which is clearly at the high end historically. So what can you tell us about the timing of the new iPhone model? Is that affecting this? You mentioned that 451 Research is finding business interest in phones, but their survey on consumers actually finds the lowest level of expectation for purchases in the next three months since 2008. You've seen the upgrade numbers from the carriers are quite low. So it seems like it's still a very tough demand environment. So where is the strength coming from in the September quarter?",1
"Luca, this is the third quarter in a row that gross margin came in above your guidance. Can you talk about whatâs driving that gap and why you expect the margin to come down sequentially in the September quarter?",1
And in terms of just regaining share in that market more broadly?,1
"Thank you, Tim and good afternoon everyone. We set a new June quarter record for revenue at $37.4 billion, up $2.1 billion or 6% year-over-year. This result was towards the high end of our guidance range, despite a reduction in channel inventory for both iPhone and iPad. The revenue growth was driven by strong sales of iPhones and Macs, as well as the continued great performance of iTunes softwares and services. Gross margin was 39.4%, above our guidance range and operating margin was $10.3 billion, representing 27.5% of revenue. Net income was $7.7 billion, translating to diluted earnings per share of $1.28, a 20% year-over-year increase.",1
"In the U.S., iPhone accounts for 41.9% of the smartphone subscriber base according to the latest data from ComScore, up from 41.3% in the previous measurement period. Also based on the latest survey by ChangeWave, iPhone earned a 97% customer satisfaction rate and among responders planning purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 50% planned to purchase an iPhone, up from 42% in the March quarter and 44% a year ago.",1
"And separately, when you just take a step back and look at the proof point that the augmented reality [AR] theme has had with this whole PokÃ©mon phenomenon, how does it impact how you think about the future? I assume you think about it. I'm just curious what goes on in your mind when you see all that. Thanks.",1
"I think we've always had â if you look at our share over time, our share in China tends to peak during launch windows. There's a higher high and a lower low there. There's a bigger difference between those two. And so what we have to do and what we're doing is innovating like crazy and delivering the best smartphone to our customers there. And if we do a really great job of that, which we will, then I'm confident that we'll do well.",1
(Operator Instructions). And your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"In terms of AR and the PokÃ©mon phenomenon, it's incredible what has happened there. I think it's a testament to what happens with innovative apps and the whole ecosystem and the power of being a developer being able to press a button, so to speak, and offer their product around the world. And just a certain developer has elected not to go worldwide yet because of the pressure on their servers, et cetera, because of the demand. But I'm sure that they will over time.",1
"In the Enterprise, global companies are using iPad to improve customer service, boost work and productivity and enhance critical processes. iPad continues to be the standard for teams across the airline industry. Qantas Airlines has over 15,000 iPads deployed to pilots as well as cabin, customer service and ground crews to enhance key processes across the daily operations and governments are deploying thousands of iPads worldwide. One of the largest examples is Sweden, where over 100,000 iPads are being used by local government offices across the country.",1
"Turning to iPad, we sold 13.3 million units, compared to 14.6 million in the June quarter last year. iPad sales grew overall in the developing markets with particularly strong year-over-year growth in the Middle-East, where iPad sales were up 64%, in China where they grew 51%, and in India, where they were up 45%. This growth was more than offset by lower sales in more mature markets. We reduced iPad channel inventory by 500,000 from the end of the March quarter, which left us within our target range of four to six weeks.",1
"Good afternoon. Tim, you gave some nice data points around Apple Pay. Can you remind us? Is this a business that ultimately impacts the Services line in any measurable way, or is Apple Pay generally about selling iPhones?",1
"Apple continues to innovate through hardware, software and services to make iPhone the best smartphone for business. Today, companies have equipped millions of employees with iPhones and they are seeing tremendous benefits in productivity, employee satisfaction and profitability. For instance medical device leader Medtronic has developed over 175 internal iOS apps for over 16,500 iPhones used by its employees to facilitate sales, improve productivity and ensure that essential marketing materials are up to date. Throughout the global offices of Nestle, the largest food company in the world, over 25,000 iPhones are accessing corporate networks, improving communication and connecting employees to critical internal resources. And at NASA over 26,000 iPhones are in use by scientists, flight crew members, technicians and researchers.",1
"On the Apple Pay side, the revenues from Apple Pay are in the Services line. The growth is astronomical, but the base is very small. And so for today, Apple Pay is very much about a great feature for our customers so that they can pay in a very simple, private, and secure way.",1
Question-And-Answer Session,1
"iPhone sales were at the high end of our expectations, despite new product rumors that we believe resulted in purchase delay. In addition, tax increases and the regulatory environment in Japan affected smartphone sales in what has been one of iPhoneâs fastest growing markets in recent quarters. Considering these factors, the performance of iPhone was even more impressive in the June quarter and it boosts our confidence for the future. We reduced iPhone channel inventory by about 150,000 from the end of the March quarter, leaving us within our target range of four to six weeks.",1
"Yes, for books and movies, we currently have those stores off, as you mentioned. To put this in some context, those two stores for the months that we had them operational, which was several months, the revenue was less than $1 million. And so it's not a revenue-related issue. From our point of view, this is a service we want to provide our customers. And so we're working very closely with the appropriate government agencies, and we hope to make books and movies available again to our customers there. And so we'll see how that goes, but we're optimistic there.",1
"Thank you. Luca, as it relates to gross margin, the guidance today is very similar to what you've provided over the last five years in terms of gross margin guidance in September versus June. And the variances that you walked through in response to Shannon's questions are very similar to the dynamics that you see in any September quarter. But there's an added factor this time around, which is you don't have the 4 million units of high-ASP, high-margin inventory drain in September like you did in the June quarter. So I guess I'd just push back and ask why gross margin guidance wouldn't be even better? Is it the more balanced NAND environment that Tim spoke to, or is there something else impacting the guidance?",1
"In education, iPad remains the tablet of choice with 85% share of the U.S. education tablet market according to the latest published estimate from IDC. Weâve now sold 13 million iPads to education customers globally. Weâre bringing teachers and students great new tools to build an experience educational count into an iPad. As of this month, teachers using the free iTunes U app can create, edit and manage entire courses that are on iPad for the first time and students can discover new ways to collaborate, including the ability to start class discussions and ask questions right from their iPad.",1
"Okay. Luca, I did understand the $3.6 billion, but you said over 4 million iPhones were drawn down. I added that to the 40.4 million, so that would suggest close to 45 million on a sell-through basis. So that was the basis for my observation.",1
"Toni, let me take it. Starting with your comments on the June quarter, I just want to point out that when we talk about a $3.6 billion channel inventory reduction, that is not entirely related to iPhone. iPhone is the vast majority of that, but we did reduce channel inventory on all other products as well. So that probably leads you to different conclusions to the math that you have just expressed.",1
"So I guess my question is, are you expecting any drawdowns in channel inventory in fiscal Q4? Are my inferences around sell-through rate incorrect? Or given the business momentum that you spoke about in response to an earlier question and the hopefulness that you expressed in your prepared remarks, Tim, I'm actually surprised that the guidance isn't a bit stronger on the top line.",1
"When I look to your guidance for Q4, I actually have the opposite question of a previous question, which is in light of the true sell-through rate, which seems to reflect better than normal seasonality in Q3, likely some contribution and elasticity from the SE, when I look at Q4, it looks like you're guiding for iPhone unit on a sell-through basis to be flat or potentially down and for total company revenues to be only fractionally up and below the seasonality we see in Q4.",1
"App Store momentum remains very strong and cumulative app downloads has topped 75 billion. We continue be amazed by our vibrant and diverse developer community and we are extremely proud that our developers have now earned over 20 billion for sales of their apps through the App Store, nearly half of which have been earned in the past 12 months. This number truly stands out among our competition as our developers continue to benefit from the broad reach and powerful design of the App Store, coupled with Appleâs large, loyal and very engaged customer base.",1
We'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Yes, thank you. You commented about the significant inventory drawdown in the quarter, $3.6 billion on the revenue side. So sell-through was $46 billion effectively, over 4 million iPhones, suggesting that sell-through iPhone sales were 45 million.",1
"I also really like what I've seen with the iPhone SE and the fact that it's opening the door to customers that we weren't reaching before and likely convincing some people to upgrade that wanted a smaller form factor but wanted to stay with iPhone, and so they were waiting for the iPhone SE. And so I see lots of positive things, and so that's how I look at it.",1
"But I'm very optimistic about the future because I see so many signs that are positive. I see an installed base that has gotten incredibly large. I see a switcher rate that is the highest ever. I see the smartphone itself, led by iPhone, becoming even more instrumental and important to people's lives. It's becoming essential. And all of the things that are coming both in the fall, the things that we've announced that you can see with iOS 10, hopefully you're running by now with the beta, those and other things make it even more instrumental. And AI even makes it even more and more. As the phone becomes more and more your assistant, it's one of those that you're not going to leave without it. And so I see all of those things as vectors that are incredibly positive.",1
"We've now taken action on over $74 billion of our $130 billion capital return program, including $51 billion in share repurchases with six quarters remaining to its completion. And finally our Board has declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share payable on August 14, 2014 to shareholders of record as of record as of August 11, 2014.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $164.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $13.9 billion. Our domestic cash was $26.8 billion at the end of the June quarter, a sequential increase of $8.3 billion and $137.7 billion or 84% of our total cash was offshore. Cash flow from operations was $10.3 billion.",1
"I don't want to talk about phones that aren't announced. And so that aside, what we have seen in the past tense or current tense on the upgrade rate is that the iPhone upgrade rate for the iPhone 6S is very similar to the iPhone 5S. And I guess in retrospect, maybe that was a predictable thing, although we didn't predict it in the beginning. It took us a little time to realize that. The iPhone 6 was significantly higher than that, and so it likely accelerated upgrades that would have been in the current year ahead of those. And so what the future holds, we'll see.",1
"Okay, thank you. And, Tim, can you speak to how you envision the upgrade rate of the iPhone installed base to play out over the next quarter or the next year? Somebody mentioned that U.S. carriers have reported really weak upgrade rates, not necessarily for iPhone, but across their installed base. The press is discussing only modest technology upgrades in your next iPhone cycle. And so those data points would lead investors to believe that the upgrade rate will be low, but curious if you have a different view. Thank you.",1
"And so versus September of 2014, for example, the U.S. dollar has now strengthened on average against international currencies by about 15%. And I think we need to accept that now we're living in this stronger U.S. dollar environment. We've taken a lot of actions on the cost side, on the pricing side, and obviously with hedges. But we need to deal with this situation, and that's where we are right now. We feel that 37.5% to 38% given the new FX environment I think says a lot about all the work that we've done on the cost side to get there. Just to give you a sense, on a year-over-year basis, when I look at foreign exchange, that has an impact of almost 300 basis points on our margins.",1
"We executed another very successful debt offering in April, issuing a total of 12 billion in notes across 3, 5, 7, 10 and 30 year maturities. In addition, during the quarter, we entered the commercial paper market for the first time with $2 billion in short-term obligations outstanding as of the end of June. We also continued to execute our shareholder return program with $8.3 billion of capital returned to inventors during the June quarter. We spent $5 billion to repurchase 59 million Apple shares to open market transactions. We paid almost $2.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and utilized over $400 million to net share settle vesting employee RSUs.",1
"Katy, I've talked about these elements at a broad level. Of course, there are degrees of positive impact. We for example on the mix front, every cycle is slightly different on our product mix, and so that clearly has an impact on gross margins. And the other thing that we need to keep in mind as we step back for a second and now we've gone through a couple of cycles where the U.S. dollar has strengthened. And as you know, we work with our hedging program where we get protection from FX fluctuations in the short term. When these hedges roll off over time, we end up replacing them with new hedging contracts at spot rates.",1
"On the September quarter, when I look at the sequential increase for iPhone units that we are expecting, I would say that it is, even with the sell-through adjustments that you've talked about, it's still pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past. As you know, we do not provide guidance for channel inventory. But I would say, in general, I think it's important to keep in mind that if we look around the world, we do see a lot of positive signs, but we also know that the macroeconomic environment is slowing down in a number of places around the world. And that needs to be taken into account in our guidance.",1
"We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our four to five week target range. The Apple ecosystem continues to grow and thrive. Total revenue from iTunes software and services was $4.5 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Our iTunes stores generated all time record billings of $5.4 billion in the June quarter, up 25% year-over-year, driven by very strong growth in App Store sales. These items billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of almost $2.6 billion, up 8% from the year ago quarter. Software and services revenue was $1.9 billion, up 19% from a year ago.",1
"We also are very happy with the switcher rate that we saw, our highest ever recorded. And the number of switchers through the nine months are the highest absolute numbers that we've ever had. And so when we look at that and then we look at the things going on, on our other products and services, and we think Services will continue to grow very briskly. We've made our best estimate of where we think we'll come in, and that's $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion.",1
"The TV, and you didn't mention CarPlay, but these are trying to provide our users a seamless experience across all the different things that they do in their lives. And so that's the rationale for CarPlay. It's the rationale for why we're putting a huge investment in the home, making â really bringing home automation to life for people in a very simple and elegant way. It's the reason for Apple TV and what we're doing in the living room. And so all these things, all these things together are all about the user experience and making people's daily lives better.",1
"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.4 million Macs, compared to under 3.8 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 18% year-over-year and a new June quarter record. The increase was driven by portables, thanks to very strong growth of MacBook Air. We achieved strong double digit Mac growth across many countries, including the U.S. Canada, Mexico, the UK, Germany, France, Australia, China, India and the Middle-East. This growth is particularly impressive, given the contraction of the overall PC market. Macs have now gained global market share for 32 of the last 33 quarters.",1
"Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up please. Operator, may we have the first question.",1
"Okay, fair enough. And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about your platform strategy. You talk about the four operating systems essentially as platforms, which I agree with. And it's just interesting to me because Apple has such a control over the vertical integration of your products, and yet you've somehow been able to grasp the openness that's required for platforms. And I think that's reflected in WWDC, as you pointed out, opening up APIs and so forth on messaging.",1
"Thank you. Tim, as you mentioned, you traveled to China during the quarter. And while you certainly sound encouraged on China and highlighted the Didi investment, there are some of the key services for Apple like iBooks and iTunes Movies that are still banned, and some of the local vendors appear to be gaining share. So can you just give us your perspective on the market, your expectations around getting those services back up, and also regaining share?",1
"Macs performed well in the U.S. education buying season with double-digit growth in the K to 12 market, driven primarily by large deployments of MacBook Air. The Shawnee Mission School District in Kansas chose Apple to provide an entire solution that will equip every teacher with a MacBook Air and an iPad Air, every high school student with a MacBook Air and every middle school and elementary student with an iPad. The Rowan-Salisbury School System in North Carolina is deploying thousands of MacBook Airs to students and teachers in grades 9 to 12 as part of the district's digital learning initiatives.",1
And you made the case there for apps versus messaging and the anti-bot argument. I'm just curious. Is that the way â am I characterizing this roughly correctly in terms about how you think about the business? And how are you managing that internally in terms of having this vertically integrated somewhat closed view of the hardware and yet this pretty open platform where the value is created externally?,1
"The minus side is that the bifurcation of the smartphone from the service itself has a plus and a minus into it. The subsidy, the lack of that â and this is more of a U.S. phenomenon than the rest of the world, some of that can be a shock for people that were used to paying $199 for their smartphone. They come back in and they pay less for the service but they pay more for their smartphone. And so there's lots of pluses and minuses on this. But overall, as I look at this for Apple, and this is not a statement on the industry itself, but for Apple, I'm very optimistic.",1
"From an upgrade point of view, there are pluses and minuses as I see it. A plus is that more and more people have already joined upgrade programs. Some of these programs, like the one that you referenced that we've done, replaces the iPhone every year. There are also carriers that have similar kind of plans, where they also replace or change out the iPhone every year. Others have an 18-month clock. Some have a 24-month clock, and there are even some that have a 30-month clock. And so there's various time schedules there. And so, as of today, there are obviously a lot more people on those programs than ever before because they just started. It really got underway in a big way last year, in a smaller way two years ago. And so we'll see more of those this coming fall.",1
"On the switcher side, we really like what we're seeing. And we think that from a user point of view, as the smartphone itself becomes more and more essential to people's daily lives, which is a part of what I had talked about before, a part of bringing it into the home in a bigger way and in the car and at work and so forth, we think people will put more and more focus on what they're buying and the thing that Apple does best, which is provide this killer experience. A killer user experience that's integrated across their lives I think becomes more important and I think that really plays to our advantage. I also think that the deployment of AI technology is something that we will excel at because of our focus on user experience, and so I like that.",1
"The iPhone demand is made up, as you know, of upgraders, switchers and new to smartphone. And so if you take it in reverse order for a minute and look at a new smartphone, smartphone penetration right now around the world at the end of December was 42%. And so there's quite a bit of room there. It is true that a lot of those are in emerging markets, but we have done â we've had reasonable business success in several emerging markets. And so we don't enter into those with no experience, although we will enter into them humbly.",1
"So I guess my question is, you have a mechanism, which is the Apple Upgrade Program, which takes replacement cycle out of the equation and puts people on buying the phone as a service. And so I'd welcome any comments on how that program is doing. And then just more broadly, is Apple thinking about ways to sell not only the iPhone, but more of its products on a monthly type subscription basis, perhaps in a more bundled fashion so that you can add more predictability to what is now largely a transactional revenue model?",1
"I was wondering if I could direct one at Tim. You talked about the upgrade cycle and how it elongated relative to the iPhone 6 and that it's similar to what you saw with the iPhone 5S. And my belief is that one of the bigger longer-term concerns for Apple is that the replacement cycle could just structurally elongate over time, particularly as your installed base of customers becomes less affluent and more international.",1
"With that, let me open the call to questions.",1
"We think to have a great platform you have to have a really healthy ecosystem. And so we're really proud of the developer community and the fact that developers are earning a lot more money in writing for iOS than other apps. We think that the best experience for users include apps, and so we want to do everything that we can do to continue building that. We now have over 2 million apps in the App Store and are more focused these days on discovery and other things to bring more great apps to the service because there are so many out there. And so that's what we're doing.",1
"Now as we move ahead into September quarter, Iâd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $37 billion and $40 billion, compared to $37.5 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to between 37% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $4.75 billion and $4.85 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $250 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.1%. Finally, we expect the Beats transaction to close this quarter and we expect the acquisition to be accreted to our earnings in our fiscal 2015.",1
Would you say there's going to be a computing shift to AR longer term?,1
"Weâve created a new tool for developers called HealthKit, which allows health and fitness apps work to together and empowers customers to choose what health data they share. We're taking the first steps in this area in collaboration with the Mayo clinic, whose new apps can automatically receive data from a blood pressure app, for example and share it with a physician, or a nutrition app can inform fitness apps how many calories are being consumed each day. Our ARM health app will provide an easy to read dashboard of all health and fitness data.",1
With that I would like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our Q3 results in more detail.,1
"We had very positive results for iPad, with broad-based growth in units, revenue, and market share. iPad sales were up 15% year over year and grew across all of our geographic segments. We achieved our highest global market share in over four years based on IDC's latest estimate of tablet market results for the June quarter. And in markets like China and Japan, over half of iPads sold were to people buying their very first iPad.",1
"Steve I think about it as differently than that, the way I think about is, weâre here to make great products and we think that if we focus on that and do that really, really well that the financial metrics will also come and so we donât see those two things being mutually exclusive. We see them having great overlap and I think if you look at how the company has executed over many years you would suggest that thatâs possible.",1
"With iOS 11, we're also bringing the power of machine learning to all Apple developers with Core ML, enabling capabilities like face detection, object tracking, and natural language interpretation. Core ML lets developers incorporate machine learning technologies into their apps with all the processing done right on device, so it respects our customers' data and privacy.",1
"But you donât go into saying we need to X% percent growth, what do we need to do from a product. It sounds like you go the opposite, what are some really great products we can do and if we do that, the metric will take care of itself.",1
"We started the product because we believe that the most important saying is that our customers love the products and want them, if you donât start at that level you can wind up creating things that people donât want. So we try very hard to focus on products and customers, enriching customers and making great products.",1
Thank you Steve. Can we have the next question please?,1
And we will go to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.,1
"Just to Billâs earlier question, Bill Shopeâs on you donât think the high-end is saturated and yet ASPs have come down quite a bit of iPhoneâs. I was wondering if you could philosophically is the current mix what we should be thinking about for iPhoneâs and more specifically would you anticipate that ASPs would continue to trend lower in iPhoneâs or stay where they are at least directionally?",1
"We believe AR has broad mainstream applicability across education, entertainment, interactive gaming, enterprise, and categories we probably haven't even thought of. With hundreds of millions of people actively using iPhone and iPad today, iOS will become the world's biggest augmented reality platform as soon as iOS 11 ships.",1
"One of the most exciting and most promising announcements from WWDC was the introduction of ARKit, a new set of tools for developers to create augmented reality apps. It's still early in the beta period, but it's clear that ARKit has captured the imagination of our developer community. We think ARKit will help the most creative minds in the industry tap into the latest computer vision technologies to build engaging content.",1
"And as we announced at WWDC, we have a very exciting fall ahead, with stunning advances in iOS 11, macOS High Sierra, and watchOS4. iOS 11 will make iPhones better than ever with Apple Pay peer-to peer payments, an even more intelligent and natural Siri, new expressive messages with full screen effects, richer and more powerful maps, enhanced live photos and memories and portrait mode effects, and much, much more. iOS 11 will also take the iPad experience to a whole new level, with features such as a customizable dock, Multi-Touch drag and drop, powerful new multitasking, more efficient QuickTime, and great new markup and scanning capabilities.",1
"We made some big announcements during the June quarter that I'd like to quickly review. We launched a new investment in the future through our Advanced Manufacturing Fund. We've earmarked at least $1 billion for this program, aimed at helping our manufacturing partners develop innovative production capabilities and create high-skill jobs in the United States. We believe this can lay the foundation for a new era of technology-driven manufacturing in the U.S. The first $200 million from the fund has been committed to Corning to support R&D, capital equipment needs, and state-of-the-art glass processing.",1
"We're also seeing incredible enthusiasm for AirPod, with 98% customer satisfaction based on Creative Strategy's survey. We have increased production capacity for AirPods and are working very hard to get them to customers as quickly as we can, but we are still not able to meet the strong level of demand.",1
"Keith in terms, we donât project ASPs, we do give guidance and we have an assumption of the ASP for the current quarter in our guidance obviously to come up with the numbers that Peter talked about earlier. If you look underneath the iPhone numbers, I think Peter alluded to earlier, we saw significant growth clearly in the lower price point year-over-year which for us is iPhone 4, it's still a great product. And that was one of the things and the iPhone 5 doing well that allows us to significantly beat what I think is probably the vast majority of expectations out there for iPhone sales. And so I donât think we do a lot better at the low end and where we sell more of those in the mix change that it has changed across the last year. If you look at 3GS last year, which was in a comparable position as our entry product, we are selling a lot more 4s and 3GSs, I think we both understand the market much better and have our things on the pulse of distribution in different countries and so forth this year. I am sure that we will get better and better at that over time and how that will change mix, I donât know.",1
"Sales of Apple Watch were up over 50% in the June quarter, and it's the number one selling smartwatch in the world by a very wide margin. Apple Watch is having a positive impact on people's health and daily lives and motivating them to sit less and move more. With features like built-in GPS and waterproofing, Apple Watch Series 2 is the perfect companion for hiking, running, and swimming.",1
"Typically, for us, a product has the highest mix during its initial few months of sales, and so you have a natural kind of seasonal decline over time of a product cycle that generally happens on iPhone, it generally happens on iPad, and we have seen it happen on the Mac over many years. And so I donât see anything that fundamentally would change that, but again, we are going to look at this thing quarter-by-quarter and tell you how we look at the quarter and give you guidance forward as we go.",1
"Okay, alright. And then Peter for you, there has been a few comments on gross margins and I want to try to broaden out a bit. In the past as you look at the one quarter forward which would be the September quarter you have given us some of the puts and takes that think about there has been a couple of specific questions asked about, but I want to broaden out and see if you could just highlight what you think are the puts and takes in the September quarter as you see them today, particularly with reference to the quarter you just reported? Thank you.",1
"I'd like to turn now to Mac, which gained global unit market share and reached new June quarter unit sales records in mainland China and Japan. Mac revenue grew 7% year over year, driven by the strength of the MacBook Pro and iMac despite IDC's latest estimate of a 4% unit contraction in the global PC market. And with the refresh of almost our entire Mac lineup in June, we're off to a great start for the back-to-school season.",1
"Sure. I am going to keep my comments limited, but I will give you a put and a take.",1
"We believe that coding is an essential skill that all students should learn. We're thrilled that over 1.2 million students of all ages are now using iPad and Swift Playgrounds to learn the fundamentals of coding. And over 1,000 K-12 schools across the United States plan to use Apple's Everyone Can Code in their curricula this fall. And for high school and community college students who want to pursue careers in the fast-growing app economy, we announced app development with Swift, an innovative full-year curriculum designed by Apple engineers and educators and provided free to schools to teach students to code and design fully functional apps, gaining critical job skills in software development and information technology.",1
Where I guess the tailwind we would expect our component costs to be favorable in the quarter.,1
"Our iPad product lineup is stronger than ever. The new iPad we launched in March offers great value and performance. And the all-new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, launched in June, features the world's most advanced display with ProMotion technology and is more powerful than most PC desktops. iPad is the perfect tool for teaching in new and compelling ways, and our iPad results were especially strong in the U.S. education market, where sales were up 32% year over year to over 1 million units.",1
"For Mac, we provided a peek at the immersive gaming, 3D, and virtual reality experiences made possible with the upcoming release of macOS High Sierra and the amazingly powerful new iMac Pro. We're proud to make the best personal computers in the industry and are very excited to deliver even more innovation in the months to come.",1
"Apple Watch will become more intelligent than ever this fall with watchOS4, featuring a proactive Siri watch face, personalized activity coaching, and an entirely new music experience. watchOS4 also introduces GymKit, a groundbreaking technology program to connect workouts with cardio equipment.",1
"We also previewed HomePod, a breakthrough wireless speaker for the home that delivers amazing audio quality and uses spatial awareness to sense its location in the room and adjust the audio automatically. Visitors to our listening room at WWDC were blown away by the HomePod's incredible sound, which is unlike any other wireless home speaker on the market. With deep knowledge of music, HomePod is designed to work with your Apple Music subscription to help you enjoy the music you already love as well as to discover great new music, based on your personal preferences.",1
"NAND pricing is fairly stable and it's following seasonal trends as we would expect, both LCDs and HDDs have, the prices have fallen and we would expect further reductions in these areas and if you look at other commodities they appear to be in supply for an imbalance and so we would expect the pricing to decline on these sort of historical levels.",1
"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Thanks to great performance from the new MacBook Pro, we generated 7% revenue growth over last year and gained share in the global PC market based on the latest data from IDC. Customer satisfaction for Mac is very strong at 97% in the most recent survey from 451 Research, and our active installed base of Mac has grown double digits over a year ago. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory, and we have a great lineup of Macs for our customers heading into the busy back-to-school season.",1
Thanks Gene.,1
From Cross Research we will go to Shannon Cross.,1
"Thank you. Tim, can you talk broadly about your discussions with both existing and potential carrier partners, I would think that 56% growth in Japan might prod one in particular to be interested in some of the coming product? And then also there has been some comments about Russia and just concerns in general about pricing in that, so how sort of in general have your discussions with your carrier partners been?",1
"The reach, usage, and functionality of Apple Pay continue to grow. We launched Apple Pay in Italy in May. And the UAE, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden are scheduled to go live before the end of this calendar year. Apple Pay is by far the number one NFC payment service on mobile devices, with nearly 90% of all transactions globally. Momentum is strongest in international markets, where the infrastructure for mobile payments has developed faster than in the U.S. In fact, three out of four Apple Pay transactions happen outside the U.S. And with the launch of iOS 11 this fall, our users in the U.S. will be able to make and receive person-to-person payments quickly, easily, and securely.",1
"I would classify them as being good. The processing on Russia probably needs some color. The articles I have seen suggested that we are not selling iPhone through carrier owned stores. If thatâs the one that you are referencing if you look at the Russian market, over 80% of smartphones are sold in retail. They are outside of carrier-owned stores and we sell through a number of national chains there, and in fact, our activations in Russia for iPhones were set of record last quarter, is our highest quarter in Russia ever. And so we are really happy with now weâre doing there. We do continue to sell through some carrier on stores as well but obviously the contribution is much less than the retail organizations and so forth and so I think that's probably not well understood there. Weâre continually looking for other relationships to both add and enhance the once we have got and I do think there are some opportunities there for us.",1
"Turning to Services, we set an all-time quarterly record of $7.3 billion, up 22% year over year. The App Store was a major driver of this performance. And according to App Annie's latest report, it continues to be by a wide margin the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play. Revenue from our Apple Music streaming service and from iCloud storage also grew very strongly. And across all of our Services offerings, the number of paid subscriptions reached over 185 million, an increase of almost 20 million in the last 90 days alone.",1
"Okay great and then can you talk a bit about commodities just in terms of pricing of some of your key commodityâs ability to procure them and how some of, I guess your supply chain is working these days.",1
"We certainly have no problem procuring. In terms of where we see pricing headed and this would have been factored into the most fortune guys (ph) appear a bit earlier. Despite the very, very weak PC market DRAM pricing has actually increased and we see continued upper pressure in this area.",1
"From UBS, we will go to Steve Milunovich.",1
"As an intelligent home assistant, HomePod is a great way to send messages, set a timer, get updates on news, sports, and weather, or control smart home kit devices by simply asking Siri to turn on the lights, close the shades, or activate a theme. We can't wait to deliver all of these powerful innovations in the months to come. And we might even have some others to share with you later in the year.",1
Thank you. Peter first could you clarify whether in your fiscal fourth quarter guidance you have any of these new products assume shipping in the quarter?,1
Steve thatâs nothing something that I can comment on.,1
"Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong with both consumers and business uses. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 95% customer satisfaction rating for iPhone 7 and 99% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among consumers planning to buy a smartphone, purchase intention for iPhone was nearly three times the rate of our closest competitor. Among corporate smartphone buyers, iOS customer satisfaction was 94%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 78% plan to purchase an iPhone.",1
"Okay and then Tim kind of a philosophical question, but whenever you talk about whatâs important in the company it always comes back to great products, better, be more important than more, Wall-Street is kind of in the more business. So I just wonder kind of talk about your philosophy and if you can come up with a couple of really great products maybe they will provide enough growth, maybe they donât but you donât seem as focused on kind of financial metrics and growth projections as a lot of companies are. Maybe tie (ph) that a little bit in your functional organizations, does that limit how many products you can actually take to market overtime?",1
"iPhone ASP was $606, up from $595 a year ago, thanks to strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which represented a higher percentage of the iPhone mix compared to the Plus model a year ago. The impact of the stronger mix on ASP was partially offset by negative foreign exchange year over year and the reduction in channel inventory, which took place entirely at the high end of the portfolio.",1
"During the quarter we sold 41 million iPhones and reduced iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units, leaving us with our lowest level of channel inventory in 2.5 years and well within our five-week to seven-week target inventory range. iPhone sales were up year-over-year in most markets we track, with many markets in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East growing unit sales by more than 25%. We are very pleased with these iPhone results, especially considering the tough comparison to the June quarter last year when we launched iPhone SE.",1
"Our performance was very strong across the board with growth in all our product categories and almost every market around the world. We achieved double-digit revenue growth in many developed markets, including the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, Australia, and Korea, and emerging markets outside of Greater China grew 19% over a year ago. Gross margin was 38.5%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 23.7% of revenue and net income was $8.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, up 17% over last year, and cash flow from operations was $8.4 billion.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter was $45.4 billion, up 7% over last year, an acceleration to the growth rate we reported during the first half of our fiscal year. We achieved these results despite a 200 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis, as currency movements, especially in Europe and China, affected our reported results.",1
"Now for more details on the June quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.",1
"Conversely, we would expect some FX pressure in the quarter given the strengthening in the dollar, particularly against the yen.",1
"Services revenue hit an all-time quarterly record of $7.3 billion, representing 22% growth over last year. We continue to see great performance all around the world, with double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments. Over the last 12 months, our Services business has become the size of a Fortune 100 company, a milestone we've reached even sooner than we had expected.",1
"Looking ahead, we are very excited about our agreement to purchase Beats Electronics and Beats Music. We think its part of Appleâs DNA and we think the addition of Beats team will be great for music lovers. Beats provides Apple with a fantastic subscription music service, access to rare talent and a fast growing line up of products that we can build upon. Not counting Beats, we've completed 29 acquisitions since the beginning of fiscal year 2013 including five since the end of the March quarter and we have brought some incredible technology and more importantly some incredible talent into Apple in the process. We are hard at work and investing heavily on exciting opportunities across our business and we have an incredible pipeline of new products and services that we canât wait to show you.",1
"Okay, thanks guys.",1
"When we introduced iOS 7 years ago, it was a revolutionary operating system for iPhone. Over the years we've extended it to the iPod family with iPod Touch and later to a tablet form factor with iPad. An explosion of apps, accessories and services for these devices has created an incredibly vibrant ecosystem. Weâre extending iOS in even more dimensions as customers around the world make iPhones and iPads an essential part of their lives, at home, at school, at work and on the go. Weâre putting a huge effort into delivering the best experience to our customers wherever they use iOS. That includes a safe and intuitive user interface for driving, called CarPlay, which is being integrated by 29 major car brands including Audi, BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes, Toyota and Volvo; and after-market systems like Pioneer and Alpine.",1
"Kulbinder, on your question on iPhone ASP, I'm not sure if I understood it correctly. But clearly the iPhone SE has a downward impact on iPhone ASP, of course, because it comes at the low end of the range. From a gross margin perspective, it is slightly dilutive to company margins, but the impact is not particularly large.",1
"And then for Tim, on the Services side, as Apple has spoken more and more loudly I guess in the last three or four quarters, I just think about some of the comments you've made about the TV market and how it's been stuck I think in the 1960s and the 1970s and the experience hasn't changed. I understand you've got the Apple TV box out. But in terms of driving actual video-on-demand services, is that something that Apple wants to do themselves? Do you want a partner? Could you even build content? How do you think about that as an actual business opportunity as opposed to here's an Apple box and we sell some units, but it's not that meaningful to the overall company in terms of size? I'm just curious given the installed base and users you have. Thanks.",1
"...for the September quarter. So essentially, we're guiding GM flat to slightly down sequentially. On the positive side, we're going to have leverage because we are guiding to a sequential increase in revenue, and we expect to have positive mix as we get into the September quarter, and these positives being offset more or less by what we call product transition costs, which are typical at this time of the year for us.",1
"Thanks, just a couple questions for me. Luca, I just want to clarify that last point on ASPs on iPhone because last quarter it seemed that you were quite clear that that was a negative driver to the gross margin of the company. So I understand there are other drivers going into the September quarter. But just to be clear, the phone units you didn't sell through that were depleted in channel inventory, those are relatively high gross margin as well. That's the clarification.",1
"We're enabling new ways to control light and doors and thermostats and other connected devices around the house using Siri with the HomeKit feature of iOS 8. And in the Enterprise, we are including new security, productivity and device management features in iOS 8. We forged a relationship with IBM to deliver a new class of mobile business solutions to enterprise customers around the world. We are working together to provide companies access to the power of Big Data analytics, right on every employee's iPhone or iPad. Using Swift, we will collaborate to bring over 100 Mobile First apps to enterprise clients, each addressing a specific industry need or opportunity.",1
"On cannibalization, of course we've got limited experience because the phone has been in the market just for a few weeks. But when we look at our survey data on iPhone SE, as Tim was saying, we believe that the iPhone SE is doing exactly what it was intended, which is we are seeing a higher rate of new to iPhone customers, which is obviously very important to us because we bring new people into the iOS ecosystem. And we see a higher rate of previous iPhone owners that really prefer the four-inch form factor. We have not seen clear evidence of cannibalization from iPhone 6S or iPhone 6S Plus. Of course, there's always going to be some level of cannibalization. But really to us what is much more relevant is the much bigger opportunity to bring more people into the iOS ecosystem.",1
"This is a radical step for Enterprise and opens up a large market opportunity for Apple but more importantly, itâs great for productivity and creativity of our enterprise customers. From the pocket to the car, to the workplace, home and gym, we have a very large vision of what iOS can be and we're incredibly excited about our plans.",1
"Mark, on the ASP question, I talked about the $595 in Q3. It's down $65 on a year-over-year basis. Keep in mind, about $20 of that $65 is foreign exchange. So during the quarter, we had this combination of starting with no iPhone SE units in channel inventory, so we had to do an at least a partial channel fill that obviously had an impact on ASPs. And then the other element was the fact that we've reduced more than 4 million units of channel inventory on the high end. So the combination of these two things obviously had an impact on ASPs. But I think as I said or Tim said during the prepared remarks, we do expect iPhone ASP to improve sequentially as we move into the September quarter because these two factors that I just mentioned are not going to repeat.",1
"On R&D growth, we do continue to invest significantly in R&D. The growth rates are still large on a year-over-year basis, and Luca can share the exact ones. But I think the recent quarter was in the mid-20% for R&D. The balance of the company we're managing more flattish from a year-over-year point of view. The products that are in R&D, there is quite a bit of investment in there for products and services that are not currently shipping or derivations of what is currently shipping. And so I don't want to talk about the exact split of it. But you can look at the growth rate and conclude that there's a lot of stuff that we're doing beyond the current products.",1
"Turning to our financial results, today we are reporting record June quarter revenue, thanks to the very strong performance of iPhone, Mac and the continued growth of revenue from the Apple ecosystem. Our teams executed brilliantly during the quarter with earnings per share up 20% year-over-year, our highest growth rate in seven quarters.",1
"We sold over 35 million iPhones, setting a new third quarter record. We generated healthy growth in our entry priced, mid-tier and lead iPhone categories. I'm especially happy about our progress in the BRIC countries, where iPhone sales were up a very strong 55% year-over-year.",1
"We also had a record June quarter for Mac sales, with growth of 18% year-over-year in a market that is shrinking by 2% according to IDCâs latest estimate. Demand has been very strong for our portables in particular and we've have had a great customer response to the new higher performance, lower priced MacBook Air. It was another strong performance for the App Store and the other services contributing to the thriving Apple ecosystem.",1
And then my follow-up for Luca is around ASPs for the iPhone. We keep getting a lot of questions around iPhone SE in terms of how cannibalistic could it be to the core iPhone franchise. Are you seeing any moderation in terms of the ASP pressures here?,1
"Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I just want to follow up, Tim, if I could, related to the R&D pace of growth, clearly a lot of momentum there over the last couple years. But we're just trying to figure out how much of that is dedicated to existing products and services versus what's next? Can you give us a sense in terms of when investors should think about the ROI coming back to them from the R&D perspective? And a corollary to that, is it really restricted just to products and services currently, or can we see more of a cloud services apparatus evolve over time where you do more and more in the enterprise just given the core trips with SAP and Cisco and IBM?",1
"Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.",1
"In fact for the first nine months of this fiscal year, the line item that we call iTunes software and services has been the fastest growing part of our business. iTunes billings grew 25% year-over-year in the June quarter and reached an all-time quarterly high, thanks to the very strong results from the App Store. We're continuing to invest in our incredible ecosystem, which is a huge asset for Apple and a very important differentiator of our customer experience. iPad sales met our expectations but we realized they didnât meet many of yours. Our sales were gated in-part by a reduction in channel inventory and in-part by market softness in certain parts of the world. For example IDCâs latest estimate indicates a 5% overall decline in the U.S. tablet market, as well as a decline in the Western European tablet market in the June quarter.",1
"But whatâs most important to us is that customers are enjoying their iPads and using them heavily. In a survey conducted in May by ChangeWave, iPad Air registered a 98% customer satisfaction rate, while iPad Mini with retina display received an astonishing 100% customer satisfaction rate. The survey also found that among people planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, 63% plan to buy an iPad and our own data indicates that more than half of customers purchasing an iPad are buying their very first iPad.",1
We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with Barclays.,1
"Another recent study by Custora found that iPad accounts for 80% of all U.S. tablet based e-commerce purchases. We're very bullish about the future of the tablet market and we're confident that we can continue to bring significant innovation to this category through hardware, software and services. We think our partnership with IBM, providing a new generation of mobile enterprise applications, designed with iPadâs legendary ease of use and backed by IBMâs cloud services and data analytics will be one such catalyst for future iPad growth.",1
"I notice there are people that want to call it a new computer platform, and we'll see. I think there's a tendency in this industry to call everything new the next computer platform. However, that said, I think AR can be huge. So we'll see whether it's the next platform. But regardless, it will be huge.",1
"We have also introduced Swift, an innovative new programming language for both iOS and OS X. Swift is the result of the latest research on programming languages, combined with decades of experience within building Apple platforms. It makes writing code interactive and fun, eliminates entire classes of unsafe code and generates apps that run lightning fast. It's easy to learn, allowing even more people to dream big and create whole new categories of apps. We believe our new OS releases, combined with Swift will result in a huge leap forward for the Apple ecosystem and we canât wait to what developers will create with Yosemite, iOS 8 and Swift.",1
"Okay, okay.",1
"On the Apple TV question, the introduction of Apple TV and tvOS last October and the subsequent OS releases and what's coming out this fall, think of that as building the foundation for what we believe can be a broader business over time. And so I don't want to be more precise than that. But you shouldn't look at what's there today and think we've done what we want to do. We've built a foundation that we can do something bigger off of.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2016, the Form 10-Q for the first two quarters of 2017, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"iPhone results were impressive, with especially strong demand at the high end of our lineup. iPhone 7 was our most popular iPhone, and sales of iPhone 7 Plus were up dramatically compared to iPhone 6s Plus in the June quarter of last year. The combined iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus family was up strong double digits year over year. One decade after the initial iPhone launch, we have now surpassed 1.2 billion cumulative iPhones sold.",1
"For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance range at $45.4 billion. That's an increase of 7% over last year, so our growth rate has accelerated in three successive quarters this fiscal year. Gross margin was also at the high end of our guidance, and we generated a 17% increase in earnings per share.",1
And from Raymond James we will hear from Tavis McCourt.,1
"Today we're proud to announce very strong results for our fiscal third quarter, with unit and revenue growth in all of our product categories. We'll review our financial performance in detail, and I'd also like to talk about some of the major announcements we made in June at our Worldwide Developers Conference. It was our biggest and best WWDC ever, and the advances we introduced across hardware, software, and services will help us to delight our customers and extend our competitive lead this fall and well into the future.",1
"Thank you, Nancy, and good afternoon and thanks, everyone, for joining us.",1
"Thanks for taking my question. Peter, first a clarification on the share buyback and can you tell us what the ending basic share count was in the third quarter?",1
"All of that is on the income statement, so you got the ending basic and diluted, but let me give you a couple of points that I think could be helpful for you. During the June quarter, we concluded the first $2 billion ASR program that we started in December and then so we got the final shares in on those, and we did our second ASR program of $12 billion, that started at the end of April and we received 23.5 million shares initially on that. And I went through in my prepared remarks, at some point during fiscal â14 that program will close and we will get the final number of shares. We also bought back 4 billion of stock in the open market during the June quarter and received about 9 million shares. So, the impact of those in the June quarter lowered our diluted share count in the quarter by about 22.9 million shares. And as you look forward into the September quarter before any further buybacks or any issuance to employees we would expect to see an additional approximate 11 million share benefit from the things that occurred during the June quarter.",1
"Great, thanks. And one for you Tim, one of the comments out of the developersâ conference was iOS, hopefully, I guess in 12 different car manufacturer models next year. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about that opportunity whether itâs a license opportunity, whatâs the strategic relevance of that if you are willing to? Thanks.",1
I am sorry I couldnât hear that question.,1
I think at the developers conference there was a comment about iOS being built into a number of car manufacturing models for next year? I was wondering if you can talk about kind of the strategic relevance for that and what the business model might be for that for Apple?,1
Thank you for the question.,1
"Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.",1
"I see it is very important. It is a part of the ecosystem, and so just like the app store is a key part of the ecosystem and iTunes and all other content are key and the services we provide from messaging to and (inaudible) support.

"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. Itâs been a very busy and exciting time at Apple and I'd like to review some of the highlights of our June quarter. We hosted our best ever Worldwide Developerâs Conference last month with over 20 million people from around the world watching our keynote session, which is the a record. We've had overwhelming response from customers and developers to the new features we previewed in OS X Yosemite and iOS 8. Yosemite has been redesigned with a fresh look and powerful new apps and iOS 8 is the biggest release since the launch of the App Store. With powerful continuity features, these upcoming releases will allow Macs and iOS devices to work together in even smarter ways.",1
"Customers can start on activity like writing an email on one device and pass it to another, picking up where they left off without missing a beat. They will even be able to make and receive iPhone calls on their Mac with just a click. These are features that only Apple can deliver. With iOS 8, we have opened over 4000 APIs providing more flexibility and opportunity for developers than ever before. iOS 8 provides developers with amazing new frameworks, enables wide use of Touch ID to securely authenticate users within apps and lets developers further customize the user experience with major extensibility features such as third-party keyboards.",1
"Shannon, on the commodity side and for the September quarter, we see NAND being pretty much in balance while DRAM and LCDs and other major commodities remain in an oversupply situation. And so overall commodity prices we expect to decline at at-least historical rates.",1
"Last month, we announced the first three solutions from our Cisco partnership, two that will dramatically improve the network performance of iOS traffic running on Cisco networks, and one that will bring the desk phone to the 21st century by integrating iPhone Wi-Fi calling into Cisco Spark.",1
"Sorry. I had that written down, but I said the wrong thing.",1
"Yeah, it's a very good question, and we remain extremely bullish on China and we're continuing to invest. Nothing that's happened has changed our fundamental view that China will be Apple's largest market at some point in the future. It's true, as you point out, that the equity markets have recently been volatile. This could create some speed bumps in the near term. But to put it in context, which I think is important, despite that volatility in the Chinese market, they're still up 90% over the last year, and they're up 20% year-to-date, and so these kind of numbers are numbers I think all of us would love.",1
"We're very excited about our news app coming to iPhone and iPad with iOS 9. We believe it will be the best news reading experience on any mobile device, combining a beautiful magazine layout with real-time customized digital media content. News will follow over a million topics and pull relevant stories based on the user's specific interests without compromising their privacy. We've already signed 25 leading publishers, representing more than 75 of the world's most influential news, sports, business and magazine titles, including CNN, the New York Times, the Financial Times, ESPN, Bloomberg Business, CondÃ© Nast, Hearst, Reuters, Time, Inc. and The Daily Telegraph.",1
"The September quarter is off to an exciting start. We're thrilled by the response to Apple Music, which launched in over 100 countries on June 30. Apple Music is a single immersive app that combines the best ways to enjoy music all in one place. It's an incredible streaming music service, a pioneering worldwide live radio station broadcasting 24 hours a day, and a great place for music fans to connect with their favorite artist. Customers and reviewers love the human curation features of Apple Music and the way it's helping people discover new music.",1
"Yeah, I'm very familiar with the ads. In certain geographies, the way that we win is to get switchers. In other geographies, the way that we win is to get people to buy their first smartphone. In other geographies, the way that we win is to get people to upgrade from their current iPhone. And all of those are very important for us. In many geographies, it's two of those or in some geographies it's all three of those. And so all of those are important. We are very focused on growing iPhone around the world, not just in one geography and getting our message out there through ads is one way to do that.",1
"Millions and millions of customers are already experiencing the new service using the three-month trial period, and the numbers are growing substantially every day. Over 15,000 artists have signed up to post on Connect, where we are already seeing great original content, including a world premiere video by Drake. Millions of listeners around the world are tuning in to Beats 1, the first of its kind worldwide radio station featuring some of the most talented and passionate music lovers on the planet. This all adds up to a renewed sense of excitement around music, which we love and expect to continue as Apple Music gets traction with customers.",1
"I also wanted to ask, can you give us any more detail on the switching rate, how much is it up? And I noticed in your advertising there's the shift to the, if it's not an iPhone, it's not an iPhone. And I assume that while you're not as involved as Jobs was, you're approving these ads. So it seems like you're really focused on market share gain right now.",1
"Also, and I can't underestimate â I can't overstate this. The rise of the middle class there is continuing, and it is transforming China. McKinsey, I saw a recent study from McKinsey that's projecting the upper middle class to grow from 14% to 54% of households over the ten-year period from 2012 to 2022. So we're within that period at this moment, and you can see for all of us that travel there so much, with every trip you can see this occurring. And so I think we would be foolish to change our plans. I think China is a fantastic geography with an incredible unprecedented level of opportunity there. And we're going to be there.",1
"Last week we launched Apple Pay in the UK, bringing customers our easy, secure and private way to pay. On day one, we had an incredible roster of over 250,000 locations and major credit and debit cards from many of the UK's most established banks supporting Apple Pay. Customers are using Apple Pay to ride the London Underground as well as the over ground systems of Transport for London and we hope this will be a model for other public transportation systems around the world.",1
"As you point out, and I think this is a major point that many people miss, the LTE penetration in China is only at 12%. And China doesn't possess the level of fiber that some other countries do, and so in order to get the great video performance, et cetera, raising that penetration is really great. I think that really plays to an incredible smartphone future there.",1
"Also, the stock market participation among Chinese household is fairly narrow. And the stock ownership is very concentrated in a few people who put what appears to be a smaller portion of their wealth in the market than we might. And so I think generally this has been, at least as we see it, maybe it's not true for other businesses, that this worry is probably overstated. And so we're not changing anything. We have the pedal to the metal on getting to 40 stores mid next year. As we had talked about before, we're continuing to expand the indirect channel as well.",1
"In the US, we've seen fantastic support from merchants of all sizes. We are excited to see this momentum continue with the new Square reader coming this fall. It will bring Apple Pay to even more neighborhood businesses where you pay every day, from your corner coffee shop to your local farmer's market, bolstering the 80,000 small- and medium-size businesses we're already adding every month. American Express will add Apple Pay support for its robust portfolio of corporate cards next month, offering businesses and their employees a new way to make easy and secure payments. And as we head into the school year, 700 universities and colleges across the US will accept Apple Pay such as Auburn University, the University of California Irvine, Colorado State University, the University of Kentucky and the University of Oklahoma, among many others. We're on track for Apple Pay acceptance at over 1.5 million US locations by the end of 2015.",1
"I'd like to thank our customers, developers, business partners and employees for another record breaking quarter. We're very hard at work on our exciting pipeline of new hardware, software and services, and we're continuing to expand our global reach into new markets. And we're passionately committed to leaving the world better than we found it.",1
"It's a rare and special privilege to launch a new platform with such promise and potential, and I know I speak for everyone at Apple when I say that we can't wait to see what our developers and customers do with it.",1
"Thank you. Tim, there's some concern about what's going on in China with the stock market and economically. How do you think that plays out for Apple? On one hand you've got more stores, broader distribution, the 4G infrastructure is playing out. On the other hand, the economy might be weakening. Is a phone a discretionary purchase or not? How do you think about going forward in China?",1
"With that, I'll turn the call over to Luca.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. As we have done for the first half of our fiscal 2015, we are reporting another record quarter today. Revenue for the June quarter was $49.6 billion, an increase of $12.2 billion or 33% year over year. Our growth was driven by the tremendous performance of iPhone, the introduction of Apple Watch and the continued strength of Mac and App Store sales. We achieved these great results in the context of a very challenging foreign exchange environment around the world and a reduction in channel inventory of over 1 million units across our product lines, which makes our growth performance even more remarkable.",1
"Thanks, Jim. Could we have the next question please?",1
"As Tim mentioned, our results were especially impressive in Greater China, where revenue more than doubled year over year to over $13 billion. Emerging markets overall grew 79% to almost $18 billion and represented 35% of our total company revenue. Company gross margin was 39.7%, better than our expectations, mainly due to strong iPhone sales. Operating margin was 28.4% of revenue and net income was $10.7 billion, a new June quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $1.85, a 45% year-over-year increase and cash flow from operations was $15 billion, also a new third quarter record.",1
Great. Thank you so much.,1
"And so these are extraordinary numbers. It's not like people have forgotten iPad or anything. It's a fantastic product. So I see a lot of runway. And as I look geographically, where we've been doing really good in the emerging markets, our share is still not high in any of them, and so there's a lot of headroom there as well, as there is in most developed markets as well. And so I look around, I see opportunity left and right. And that's what we're focused on.",1
"For details by product I'll start with iPhone. We sold 47.5 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 35% year over year growth and demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus has continued to be terrific all around the world. iPhone sales more than doubled in Germany, Korea, Malaysia, and Vietnam. We're up over 85% in Greater China and in India, and increased more than 45% in several countries including Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Turkey.",1
"The strong mix of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus led to an iPhone ASP of $660, an increase of $99 year over year, despite the significant negative foreign exchange impact I referred to earlier. We reduced iPhone channel inventory by about 600,000 units during the quarter, which left us at the low end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of channel inventory.",1
"And so the other things that you named, whether it be Apple Music or Apple Pay, both of these are very important to us. And things that you didn't mention, the Mac continues to perform very well. I am still bullish on iPad. We've gotten with iOS 9, there's some incredible productivity enhancements coming in with split view and slide over and picture-in-picture. These things are incredible features. The enterprise business is clearly picking up and more and more companies are either contracting for or writing apps themselves. I think and I believe that the iPad consumer upgrade cycle will eventually occur because as we look at the usage statistics on iPad, it remains unbelievably great. I mean, the next closest usage of the next competitor, we're six times greater.",1
"We hosted a fantastic developers' conference in June with thousands of attendees from 70 countries coming together with Apple engineers to share in the excitement of our three operating systems, OS X, iOS, and watchOS. We've been working hard to make our products even more intelligent, more powerful and more meaningful in all aspects of our customers' lives, while adding new continuity features to make the experience across our devices more seamless than ever and preserving the security and privacy that our customers deserve. Public betas of OS X El Capitan and iOS 9 are available now and customer versions of all three updated OSs are on schedule and will be delivered in the fall.",1
"This is just the beginning of what this new platform can deliver. With Apple watchOS 2, developers now have the ability to build richer and more powerful native apps for Apple Watch, taking advantage of the heart rate sensor, the Digital Crown, accelerometer and more, ushering in a whole new class of apps designed specifically for the wrist.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenues, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2015, the Forms 10-Q for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"A major highlight of the past quarter for all of us here at Apple was the launch of Apple Watch in April. As you know, we've been very excited to get this revolutionary product to customers. We started taking preorders in nine countries on April 10, and demand immediately exceeded supply by a wide margin. To prioritize those first orders and to deliver the best experience for our customers, we delayed the availability of Apple Watch in our own retail stores until mid June. We made huge progress with the production ramp across the quarter and near the end of the quarter expanded into six additional countries. And in just the past few days, we've been able to catch up with demand, enabling us to expand Apple Watch availability to a total of 19 countries currently with three more countries to be added at the end of this month.",1
"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us. It's been a busy and exciting quarter and I'm delighted to talk to you about the highlights. Today, we're proud to report record June quarter results with revenues of $49.6 billion and earnings of $10.7 billion. Our year-over-year growth rate in the fiscal third quarter accelerated over the first half of fiscal 2015. Revenues were up 33%, our fastest growth rate in over three years, and earnings per share were up 45%. We achieved these incredibly strong results despite reducing channel inventories across our product lines by over 1 million units and despite the challenging FX environment.",1
"Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple, Incorporated third quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded.",1
"And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation. We do thank everyone for your participation.",1
"Revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance by $1.6 billion as we topped our internal expectations for sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch. We had another stellar quarter for iPhone, establishing a new June quarter record. iPhone unit sales grew 35%, which is almost three times the rate of growth of the smartphone market overall and we gained share in all of our geographic segments. iPhone revenue grew even more strongly, up 59%. The strong iPhone results were broad-based in both developed and emerging markets and we experienced the highest switcher rate from Android that we've ever measured.",1
"Most importantly, iPhone customer metrics are tremendous. ChangeWave's most recent survey of US customers found that iPhone has the highest customer satisfaction rate of any smartphone brand by a wide margin, and that among iPhone owners planning to purchase a new phone, 86% plan to purchase another iPhone. That compares to 50% repurchase intent for the next highest brand measured.",1

"We also had a tremendous record quarter for Mac, continuing to defy the industry trend with unit growth of 9% in a market that IDC estimates contracted by 12%. Growth was fueled by great response to our new MacBook and we're working hard to catch up with customer demand.",1
"We generated over $5 billion in services revenue, setting a new all-time record. Within services, the App Store produced its best quarter ever with revenue growing 24%.",1
"Our results from Greater China were outstanding with revenue growth of 112% and iPhone unit growth of 87%. This is particularly impressive given IDC's estimate of only 5% growth for the Greater China smartphone market. We also achieved our highest ever PC market share in the segment with Mac sales growing 33% over last year. And our ecosystem in China continues to grow at a very fast pace, with App Store revenue more than doubling in the quarter. Luca will go into more detail on our product and financial results in a moment.",1
"A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

And these replays will be available by approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.",1
"Thank you, Shannon.",1
And that'll come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"Yeah, Shannon, it's Tim. Maybe the best way to talk about this is sort of at the product level. On the Watch, our June sales were higher than April or May. I realize that's very different than what some of the, is being written, but the June sales were the highest. And so the Watch had a more of a back-ended kind of a skewing. The phone itself followed what I would call a normal seasonal kind of pattern. And if you look at the â it sounds like you're honing in on the Greater China results themselves. There is no obvious impact from the last quarter in the Greater China numbers. And obviously with the aggregate or the consolidated number being 112%, it's hard to find a lot of bad things in the numbers.",1
"The feedback from Apple Watch customers is incredibly positive and we've been very happy with customer satisfaction and usage statistics. Market research from Wristly measured a 97% customer satisfaction rate for Apple Watch and we hear from people every day about the impact it's having on their health, their daily routines, and how they communicate. Our own market research shows that 94% of Apple Watch owners wear and use it regularly, if not every day.",1
"Great. And then can you talk a bit about linearity during the quarter on a geographic basis? Somewhat going back to the China question, I mean did you see it slow down toward the end of the quarter? Or was it solid through it? And just any other color you can give geographically with Europe and some of the other macro events that are going on.",1
"Messaging and activity features are among the most popular and social networking apps including Twitter, WeChat and LINE are seeing the most usage among third party apps. We believe that the possibilities for Apple Watch are enormous and that's been reinforced in just the first few weeks since it became available to customers.",1
"I have to say that it's been remarkable. Look, in the long run a strong US dollar is not a positive for our international business. It's normal to see a drop in demand when prices go up. That goes without saying. It has been remarkable so far to see that we did take prices in a few markets. But really remarkable to see how resilient iPhone sales have been, because we have increased, in spite of these price increases, we've increased sales and we've increased market share in all our geographies around the world, without exception.",1
"Yes, Shannon. So obviously FX has been a significant hit in many ways, of course. I mean it reduces our growth rate. We would be 800 basis points higher this quarter from the 33% that we've reported if it wasn't for the movement in currencies around the world. And really when you look around the world, it's really if you exclude China, essentially every single currency has weakened against the dollar. We are pretty careful and thoughtful about where we increase prices and when and by how much during mid-cycle because it's not something that we particularly like to do. We've had circumstances around the world this year where frankly we didn't have many options because the currency movement was so large and so we've had to reprice.",1
"For example, doctors and researchers at leading hospitals in the US and Europe are already putting Apple Watch to work in improving patients' lives. Nebraska Medicine, the latest hospital to adopt Apple Watch, has rolled out new apps that facilitate communication between patients and doctors and provide quick access to important chart and dosage information.",1
"Ochsner Health System of Louisiana is using Apple Watch with hypertension patients to gather important information like daily activity and blood pressure level, and leading cancer centers like London King's College Hospital are incorporating Apple Watch into trials for ongoing care and monitoring of cancer patients.",1
"Great Apple Watch solutions go well beyond healthcare. Users are tracking their fitness, getting breaking news alerts, following their investments, connecting with friends, and living a healthier day. The user experience for Apple Pay and Siri is nothing short of incredible and customers are enjoying countless other features through the over 8,500 third-party apps available for Apple Watch.",1
Thank you very much. I wanted to talk about FX but not necessarily from a direct impact. But what are you seeing in terms of demand as you've raised prices in various geographies and how are you thinking about it as you go into sort of the next iPhone cycle in terms of having to sort of normalize the pricing for what some of the currencies have done over the past year?,1
"Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.8 million Macs, representing 9% year-over-year growth. As we have done for several years in a row, we continued to gain significant market share based on IDC's latest estimate of a 12% global PC market contraction. Mac growth was driven by portables and we are delighted with the very strong customer reception of our new MacBook. We ended the quarter slightly below our 4 to 5 week target range for Mac channel inventory.",1
"In terms of the other things that we're doing, we have some great capability and great teams in Apple. And so we can do more than one thing, and so we have other things that we're working on as well. But at the aggregate level, we still remain very focused because if you look at our size versus the number of projects we have going, it's much smaller compared to most. But that's how we do things and that's how we get the level of quality that we want out of each one of those.",1
"Turning to iPad. We sold 10.9 million compared to 13.3 million in the year-ago quarter. iPad sell-through was 11.2 million as we reduced channel inventory by about 300,000 units. This left us within our 5 to 7 week target range of iPad channel inventory. iPad customer metrics continue to be extremely positive. ChangeWave recently measured a 97% customer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2 and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, over half plan to purchase an iPad. For corporate buyers, the purchase intent was even stronger at over 70%.",1
"Okay, great. Thank you. Could you walk us through the key factors behind your gross margin range for the September quarter and in particular how we should think about the sequential ForEx impact this quarter and the impact of a potential product transition cost?",1
"Oh, I think there's no doubt if you look at it we are expanding the market size in those areas. It's also true that there's some people that are switching from comparable price points to the iPhone, and that's great too. But I think the answer is that both of those things are happening and it's key that we do both, not just one.",1
"In terms of what's going on with iPhone, the 35% growth is almost three times the market. And if you look at it at a little narrower regional level, Western Europe grew 30% versus a market of 7%, so four times market. Japan grew over five times market. We doubled in Korea versus a market that was shrinking. And India we grew at 93% and this is on top of the Greater China numbers that we've already covered that grew 87% during the quarter against a market of 5%. And so we did exceptionally well I think in any way that you look at it.",1
"Tim, I'm asking in part because you talked about the highest ever Android switcher. So I'm wondering if indeed your goal of expanding the category is happening or whether you are taking share and how do you measure the relative contribution of each of those in your success. So is the strength and the dramatically above market growth because you're taking share in that high-end category and how far along are you there? Or can you point to proof points that you've actually expanded the size of the market for products of your price point?",1
"In terms of the percentage of customers that have upgraded to a 6 and 6 Plus versus that have not upgraded, it's 73%, or meaning that 27% of the installed base of customers prior to the launch of 6 and 6 Plus have now upgraded. And so we view that as a very bullish sign on the future, that there's a lot of headroom left for upgraders. We also are incredibly happy to see the highest Android switcher rate that we've observed. And so from our point of view, the iPhone is doing outstanding.",1
"Toni, it's Tim. We look at it a bit differently than you do. We look at it as our job is to grow our products regardless of the price, which means that we need to convince in some cases people to move from one price band to the other. And that we think if we do a great job with the product that people will be willing to spend more because they get so much more out of it. And I think you can look at the results on the iPhone and see that in action. I mean, we grew 87% in China. We grew 90%-plus in India. Emerging markets are growing 65%. These numbers are unbelievable and they're done in an environment where it's not the best of conditions. So that's how we look at. We don't do the MBA analysis of there's only X people buying in a price band and therefore we can only get X minus Y percent. That's not the way we've ever looked at it. If we did, we wouldn't be shipping any products.",1
"So Tim, just to extend that conversation to the longer term, as I'm sure you're aware, you're lapping some pretty significant comps as it relates to the upgrades that you're talking about as well as significant growth in China. What is the framework that you use to convince yourselves that iPhone units can continue to grow over the longer term?",1
"Well you know, Katy, we purposely just give guidance for the current quarter and we've done that. And obviously the kind of numbers that we have indicated growth in the revenue means that iPhone would have another stellar quarter. And so we're very confident that this quarter is going to be great. How the future looks, we'll take it one quarter at a time. But as I back up from it and look at it more from a macro point of view, the things that makes me very bullish is the 27% number I just quoted, the fact that we are seeing the highest Android switcher rate, the customer satisfaction that we have on the iPhone versus the competition. It's a huge margin. The loyalty rate that we have versus competition, an enormous gap there.",1
"I also look at the first time iPhone buyers and we're still seeing very, very large numbers in the countries that you would want to see those in, like China and Russia and Brazil and so forth. I also see a market that over a five-year horizon, if you look at the IDC numbers, is projected to grow from 1.3 million in 2014 to over 1.9 billion â this is billion, rather, billion in 2019. And so it's an incredible market. I think everybody's going to own a smartphone, and I think we've proven that we can compete for a fair number of those, as you can see from our results.",1
That will come from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.,1
"Yes, thank you. Luca, I think in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about your market share of iPad in the US above $200 being 78%. And I'm wondering if you think about the iPhone and your market share in the premium category, how do you think about it? So I've seen market data that says 60% market share for phones above $300 or you have actually 90% market share for phones above $600. And I'm wondering if, Tim or Luca, you could maybe talk about how you think about your market share, where you play given that your ASP is comfortably above $600? What do you think your market share is above $500 or $600 in smartphones? And how do we think about that, that market share going forward?",1
"Definitely. This is Luca. So we got into 38.5% to 39.5%, and so just keep in mind last year in Q4, our gross margin declined by 140 basis points sequentially. So this year we're expecting a sequential decline of 220 basis points. I would point to three main factors for the decline. First of all, to your point around foreign exchange, it continues to be a challenging environment given the strengthening of the US dollar. In our case, the impact on margin after the hedges is going to be about 30 basis points for Q4. Also, I want to point to a different mix, which is typical of our seasonality as we enter the back-to-school season during Q4. And thirdly, the transition cost that you've mentioned as we prepare for a busy fall. And so those are the three factors that will have an impact on gross margin sequentially. I would point that in general costs continue to be, particularly commodity costs continue to be favorable and so there would be a partial offset to the factors that I mentioned.",1
"Jim, it's Tim. We think the phone has a lot of legs to it. I mean, many, many, many years. There's tons of innovation left at the phone. I think we're in the early innings of it, not in the late innings, and I think the market rate of growth over the long haul will also be impressive. And so there will be multiple winners here. And so that's how I see it.",1
From Bernstein we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.,1
"Okay, thanks. And then could you give us a bit more color on the mix dynamics for the iPhone in the June quarter and how this compares to prior generations and your expectations? Obviously there continues to be an upward bias helping the ASPs as you mentioned, but could you give us a bit more detail on what exactly you're seeing here? Particularly I think it's interesting in the context of a continued tilt towards the emerging regions obviously.",1
"Yeah, so as we mentioned, the ASP for iPhone was up $99, 18% increase year-over-year and this is really driven by the mix, by the fact that we've added iPhone 6 Plus to a new price point and in general, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are doing extremely well as a percentage of the portfolio. And keep in mind that this $99 was partially offset by $24 of unfavorable foreign exchange. So the number would have been even better. So yes, clearly 6 and 6 Plus. And I think we talked about it in prior calls, the 6 Plus is doing particularly well in the markets that you would expect, Greater China, other Asian markets. Those are markets where our growth rates are particularly strong and the 6 Plus, because of the screen size, is doing extremely well.",1
"And so as I look at all of these things, we feel really great about how we did. Now our objective for the quarter wasn't primarily sales. Beyond the very good news on sales, we're more excited about how the product is positioned for the long term because we're starting a new category. And as I back up and look at this, we have 8,500 apps. We've already announced the next operating system, watchOS 2. It will bring native apps which are going to be killer to the Watch. Even though the store layout was delayed, we've learned a lot about the buying experience. Based on that experience, we're now planning to expand our channel before the holiday because we're convinced that the Watch is going to be one of the top gifts of the holiday season.",1
"Secondly to provide a bit more color, sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter. And to give you a little additional insight, through the end of the quarter, in fact the Apple Watch sell-through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the original iPad. And we were able to do that with having only 680 points of sale. And as you probably know, as I had reviewed earlier, the online sales were so great at the beginning, we were not able to feed inventory to our stores until mid-June. And so those points of sale pretty much, the overwhelming majority of the low numbers of sales were not there until the last two weeks of the quarter.",1
"Yeah Gene, this is Tim. Let me talk about the Watch some. As you know, we made a decision back in September, quite several months ago not to disclose the shipments on the Watch and that was not a matter of not being transparent, it was a matter of not giving our competition insight that's a product that we've worked really hard on. However, let me give you some color so to avoid reaching sort of a wrong conclusion. If you look at the other products category and look at the revenue in this category, it would not be an accurate thing to just look at the sequential change or the year over year change and assume that were the total Watch revenue because the aggregate balance of that category, both sequentially and year over year, is shrinking. Obviously iPod is a part of that, but there are other things in there, accessories and so forth, that are shrinking.",1
"There are things that remain relatively similar as we launch new products. For example, we innovate the products. We want to make them better all the time, and that typically requires additional cost and so the cost structures of our products, new products, tend to be higher than the products that they replace. Having said that, as you know we've got a very, very good track record to reduce those cost factors over the lifecycle of the products. I think this should give you a bit of color. Of course maybe the one thing that I want to point out again as we get into the following year, is that of course currency will be an issue.",1
"Okay Gene, let me start with gross margin. As Tim said before, obviously we guide to the current quarter. You know, as we look at it at a macro level. I think there are, you know every cycle is different for a variety of reasons. There are also things that are not necessarily within our control. So for example, currency markets can be very different one year to the next. We know that the next year is going to represent an additional challenge given where the dollar has moved. Commodity markets may be very different from one year to the other.",1
All right. Thank you.,1
"Hi, good afternoon. Luca, you talked a little bit about gross margins in the previous question. But could you talk about how we should think about the trends in the gross margin? In other words is, should the margin trends that we've seen in other cycles continue into next year? And then a follow-up or another question for Tim here, is that the Watch has been under a lot of interest from investors and some may have wanted a little bit more. You outlined some of the opportunities and some of the progress you've had. But any thoughts that you have for investors who may say that the category is just not taking off as fast as they would have hoped?",1
"Okay. And then if I could just ask you to comment on how you think about replacement cycles with the current iPhone 6 cycle. So when you look at replacement cycles over the last three quarters, are they similar to what you saw one and two years ago when you think about replacement? And one of the things that also sort of struck me was I think you cited market research having repurchase intention of 86% versus your competitors at 50%. Quite frankly, the 86% sounds low to me. Is that actually consistent with what you see in the marketplace, about 86% of iPhone buyers ultimately buy another iPhone? So perhaps we can think about replacement cycle.",1
"And so in this particular quarter, we were able to end basically right at the bottom end of our range and we view that as a good thing, not a bad thing. Obviously the revenues could have been much higher if we would have expanded the channel, but if you don't need to do that, that's not how we think about the business. We run the business for the long term, not the 90-day clock.",1
"Katy, it's Tim. As Luca mentioned, the channel inventory did go down by 600,000. We sold more units than we thought we would and so that was a part of that. The other part of it is that we always run with just the amount of inventory that we think we need. And so to the degree that sales are distributed in the countries with disproportionally with shorter supply chains, or the standard deviation demand is less, we would always choose to have less.",1
"Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. While the year on year iPhone growth was very attractive, the sequential unit decline in the June quarter was worse than the past two years. Why do you think that was, and in particular, why drain channel inventory when iPhone 6 is selling so well? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"We do not participate in the low end of the tablet market, but we are extremely successful where we do compete. NPD recently indicated that iPad has 76% share of the US market for tablets priced above $200. We're very excited about the advances in the iPad experience coming in iOS 9 in the fall, including the slide over and split view features for retail multitasking, picture-in-picture for FaceTime and video, and enhanced QuickType for composing text even faster.",1
"We're also seeing great momentum in the enterprise market. For instance, riding on the success of iPad use by its pilots, United Airlines has not only renewed its iPad program with more than 10,000 iPad Air 2s, but has also made a strategic decision to provide iPhones to over 20,000 flight attendants. In the near future, United plans to introduce new apps to transform the customer experience and improve integration with flight operations.",1
"We're also very happy with the progress of our IBM partnership. IBM released 13 new MobileFirst for iOS apps in the June quarter, including new apps in retail banking and healthcare, as well as new horizontal apps for HR and sales. There are now 35 apps in IBM's MobileFirst for iOS catalog that connect users to big data and analytics right on their iPads or iPhones. And we expect a total of 100 apps to be available by the end of 2015.",1
"Active customer engagements have also grown to over 500 and recent notable customer wins include Air Canada, National Grid in the UK and Banorte in Mexico. In April, Apple, IBM and Japan Post announced a joint initiative to deliver iPads with IBM developed apps and analytics to connect Japanese senior citizens with services, healthcare, community and family. Japan Post hopes to reach 4 million to 5 million Japanese customers with these solutions by 2020. Since announcing this initiative less than three months ago, we've already seen strong interest from other countries looking for innovative ways to support an aging population.",1
"Importantly, we also continue to work closely with leading business software and solution providers to help businesses of all sizes transform work with iPad and iPhone. The number of these mobility partners has expanded rapidly to over 40. They're developing new and differentiated solutions on iOS across many industries, and attracting very significant customer interest.",1
"Turning to services. We generated over $5 billion in revenue, a new all-time record, and an increase of 12% over last year thanks primarily to strong growth from apps. The revenue from the App Store increased 24% and the number of transacting customers grew 19%, also setting an all-time record. Services growth was particularly strong in China, where the App Store revenue more than doubled year over year. China based developers have created 250,000 apps for our China App Store and the response from our customers has been tremendous.",1
"Thank you very much. As you look at many of your products have been absolutely fantastic and at different phases in their life, they've seen tremendous high growth, whether it's iPad, iPhone, iPod, and iPhone looks like it's facing some very challenging comps here in the next few quarters. Does this make you shift even more strategic focus into broadening the reliance on a couple products such as you mentioned Apple Radio. There's a lot more content on the Apple Watch and apps and then also Apple Pay. Are you increasingly focusing on hiring and kind of non hardware things (45:32)? Or are these kind of more peripheral activities and still the focus is kind of right now on the phone?",1
"The revenue from other products grew sharply, up 49% over last year. The contribution from Apple Watch accounted for well over 100% of the growth of the category, and more than offset the decline of iPod and accessory sales. As we've said in the past, we do not plan to disclose Apple Watch metrics because we don't intend to provide insight that could help our competitors.",1
"Our retail and online stores had a very busy quarter, with customer visits up 49% year-over-year, driven especially by the very strong interest in Apple Watch. Thanks to our very popular Apple Store app, mobile traffic to our online stores during the quarter equaled desktop traffic for the first time ever. We opened three new stores, our second store in Brazil, our sixth store in Manhattan, and our twenty-second store in Greater China. That brought us to a global store count of 456, of which 190 are outside the United States, and we are on track to have 40 stores open in Greater China by the middle of next year.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $202.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $9.3 billion. $181 billion of this cash, or 89% of the total, was offshore. In the June quarter, we issued a total of $10 billion of term debt, consisting of $8 billion US dollar denominated notes and Â¥250 billion denominated notes as we continue to diversify our global debt investor base. This left us with $50 billion of term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter.",1
We'll go to Jim Suva with Citi.,1
"During the quarter, we turned over $13 billion to our investors. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $4 billion to repurchase 31.2 million Apple shares to open market transactions. We also launched a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May and received an initial delivery of 38.3 million shares. The purchase period for the new ASR will end in or before November of 2015.",1
"We have continued to execute our capital return program at a fast pace and we now take an action on over $126 billion of our $200 billion program, including $90 billion in share repurchases. The weighted average price for all open market purchases and completed ASR programs to date is $86.",1
"Now as we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $49 billion and $51 billion compared to $42.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $5.850 billion and $5.950 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%.",1
"Thank you, Toni. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"On the upgrade cycle and what we're seeing, it's not remarkably different. However, there's a number of plans that people began signing up for in the last year that could change it. These are upgrade any time kind of plans. They may be one year leases that could actually help the upgrade rate. And I think it'll be interesting to see how that plays out over the next horizon. But generally speaking, I see positive vectors there, not negative, in the aggregate.",1
The 86% also seems low to me but I was quoting a third-party source and not our own data. Our own data would look better than that. But the numbers are only comparable if I quote the third-party source for both and so that's what I'm doing.,1
"Also today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2015 to shareholders of record as of August 10, 2015.",1
And how that's changed and the percentage number and how that jives with reality?,1
"We ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?",1
[Operation Instructions] First we will hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Thank you, good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. And after that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"In addition, today's comments will refer to a metric we describe as installed base related purchases. This is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our Investor Relations website at Apple.com/investor.",1
"Yes, Shannon. Let me correct you. It's 37.5% to 38%...",1
"Turning to Services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 19% over the June quarter last year. We set a new record for customers transacting on our iTunes Stores. And among our customers who purchase apps and content, the average amount spent per customer was the highest that we've ever measured. The App Store's growth rate has now accelerated for four consecutive quarters, reaching 37% in Q3. The App Store is overwhelmingly the preferred destination for both customers and developers. According to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the June quarter, widening our lead from the March",1
"One other point I might add on this, because I think this is interesting. I donât think it came out in our commentary so far as; the market's very bifurcated on iPad. In the BRIC countries, iPad did extremely well. The growth was very high. Like in the China it was in the 50%s, in the Middle East it was in the 60%s. Luca may have mentioned those numbers. In the developed countries like the U.S., the market is clearly weaker there. Itâs interesting to note however that the U.S. as an example, we had a very, very strong Macintosh market in the U.S. and so there is probably a bit of higher add kind of stuff beginning to play out too, where higher add is clearly still very much notebook oriented. K12 on the other hand, we sell 2.5 iPads for every Mac in the K12. And so we're clearly headed into that season now and it typically starts in graduation time prime in fiscal Q3 for us. And so I think thatâs probably another thing that we're seeing.",1
One more question if I could. You've had obviously great performance in the BRIC countries and you've touched on China for few categories. Can you talk about the overall demand environment you saw for China in the quarter? Obviously there's some seasonal factors to consider but how should we think about your performance versus your expectations and how you are thinking about it for the rest of the calendar year?,1
"China, honestly was surprising to us that it was -- we thought it would be strong but it well went past what we thought. We came in at 26% of revenue growth, including retail and if you look at the units, the unit growth was really off the charts across the board. I found 48% off that compares to a market estimate of 24%. So growing it two times the market. iPad was up as well, as I've mentioned before. The Mac was up 39% and thatâs versus a market in China thatâs also contracting along with markets in most parts of the world and China was projected to contract by 5%. And so we're seeing some substantial strength there and the thing thatâs actually growing the most is the iTunes software and services category, which has the App Store and et cetera and that area is almost doubling year-over-year.",1
"And so itâs very, very exciting what we're seeing there. We are still in the process of rolling out along with our partner China Mobile, the TD-LTE into more cities and we're still in early going on that. That just started in January as you know. And my understanding is that later this year there will be a license for the other operators to begin shipping FDD-LTE, which I think is another big opportunity in China.",1
"Thank you, Bill. Could we have the next question please?",1
Next we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.,1
"I have one for Luca and one for Tim please. Luca, I wanted to revisit the gross margin question. You talked about guidance for next quarter, that the drivers of the sequential decline being a normal mix through the cycle on transition cost. Your guidance to the midpoint is down 190 basis points in gross margin, last year in Q4 gross margins were up 10 basis points sequentially in fiscal Q4 and the product transition issues or cycle issues that you alluded to seem essentially identical. So I'd like to try and understand what might make this Q4 different letâs say than last Q4?",1
"Because of this continued growth, for the first nine months of our fiscal year, Services increased from 8% of our total revenue a year ago to 11% this year, and it represents an even higher percentage of our profitability.",1
quarter.,1
"If I understand the question, also when you look at it in terms of absolute levels of gross margin, last year it was 37%. So our range is above that level. There is obviously many, many things that affect us in different ways from one year to the other. Foreign exchange is a case where a lot of the emerging market currencies and the yen and the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, they have been weaker against the U.S. dollar. That has an impact on margin. And also when you think our product cycle, I think we donât get into the specifics but this is not exactly the same cycle as we've had a year ago.",1
"iPhone continues to show great momentum in business markets. A recent survey by 451 Research found that among U.S. corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPhones. This is the highest corporate purchase intent ever measured by the survey for the September quarter.",1
"And so I think our theory that has been there honestly since the first time that we shipped iPad, that the tablet market would eventually surpass the PC market, that theory is still intact. I just think we have to do some more things to get the business side of it moving in a faster trajectory and I think we're now on to something that can really do that. So as I look at it and sort of back up from the 90 day clock kind of thing, I'm incredibly excited. I'm excited about the plans that we have on the product side and also on the go to market side, and in particular the IBM announcement.",1
"I mean is it better? If we look back two years to the iPhone 5, your product margins were down 260 basis points sequentially. So is the reference there that we should be thinking in terms of changes that are more akin to what we saw two years ago rather than to this year?",1
"I wouldnât necessarily draw that analogy. I think we need to start thinking from the fact that we had a very, very strong Q3. A lot of things came together extremely well. 37% to 38% is a range that is -- we think is very good, and thatâs where we are right now and we still have several weeks in the quarter.",1
"We experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets, with sales in Russia more than doubling year over year, and double-digit growth in many other key countries, including Japan, Turkey, Brazil, India, Canada, and Sweden.",1
"For details by product, I will start with the iPhone. We sold 40.4 million iPhones in the quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by over 4 million units compared to about 0.5 million units a year ago, so sell-through was down by 8%. We exited the quarter near the low end of our five-week to seven-week target range for channel inventory. The rollout of our new entry-level iPhone SE concurrent with the channel reduction of more than 4 million higher-end iPhones resulted in a lower than usual iPhone ASP of $595. Therefore, we expect ASPs to improve this quarter.",1
"Tim, I wanted to get your input on the impact of trade-in programs for the iPhone, particularly in mature markets where they are most prevalent. As best I can tell, if I look at the last four quarters, they're not hyper-focused on 90 days. It looks like the iPhone has been about flat in unit terms in the Americas and up low single digits in Europe and I think Europe includes India, which is obviously very fast growing. So perhaps low single digits in Europe. So if we look at those western geographies, we've seen relatively flattish iPhone unit sales over the last year. I know you donât report it but just sort of based on overall revenue reporting, I'm wondering if you can comment on what you're seeing in terms of iPhone trade-in programs and this is four quarters, still over a complete cycle. Whether you think they are elongating or shrinking and what impact is very prevalent, increasingly prevalent trade-in programs might be having on them and what impact your pricing of older generation devices might be having on them.",1
"Yes, the theory that you have Toni is not precisely correct. Like if I look at Europe, the operating segment of Europe for quarter or year-to-date for 2014 versus the same period last year, iPhone units were actually up 10%. Your more macro question; what I understand to be your macro question of do I think there is some sort of cannibalization going on trade-in programs on new product sales? What I think is happening in the aggregate if you look across the world is that trade-ins are actually hugely beneficial for our ecosystem because people wind up -- we have more people that are able to join the party when we have a trade-in, because in essence, it winds up being used by -- probably the prime example someone else within the family or in the example that has become more common in the last year, someone trades it in and then that goes to either somebody else in that country that is very price sensitive or somebody in a different country and I see all of this as good.",1
"Gross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range. Operating margin was 23.9% of revenue, and net income was $7.8 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.42, and cash flow from operations was strong at $10.6 billion.",1
"On a geographic basis, our revenue grew strongly in Japan to a new June quarter record, and we experienced healthy growth in a number of other important markets, including Russia, Brazil, Turkey, India, and Canada.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter was $42.4 billion, near the high end of our guidance range, compared to $49.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Customer demand for our products and services was stronger than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. As Tim mentioned, we reduced overall channel inventories by roughly $3.6 billion.",1
"In looking at how much of it cannibalizes, it is very hard to answer that question with any degree of preciseness. But my gut is that the cannibalization factor is low, because you wind up having -- you wind up attracting people that are much more price sensitive in there. I think the great thing is that our products command a much higher resale value than others do. And so that leads to a larger trade-in and from my perspective, that being the larger ecosystem, more people that wind up getting on iPhone, and as you know from following us for quite some time, if we get somebody to try an Apple product and then buy an Apple product, the likelihood that they begin buying other Apple products that may be in different categories or upgrading to one in that category and the future is very high. And so net-net, I view it to be positive. Itâs very difficult to quantify with certainty.",1
"Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.3 million Macs compared to 4.8 million last year. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales across the industry, with IDC estimating a 4% global contraction. In addition to the overall market slowdown, we faced a very difficult compare to the year-ago quarter, when we introduced a new MacBook Pro and a new iMac. Despite these challenges, Mac continues to gain a high percentage of new customers, and our Mac installed base has grown to a new all-time high at the end of the June quarter. We ended the quarter below our four-week to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.",1
"And so we're excited about bringing that to business along with partnering with IBM, which we think is a first class company. And seeing what that can do to sales of business, which I honestly believe the opportunity is huge. The market is still predicted in 2018 -- I think these are Gartner numbers -- to be about 350 million in size and put that in some context, I think the PC market right now is about 315 million.",1
"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today we're pleased to report third quarter results that reflect stronger customer demand and business performance than we anticipated just 90 days ago and include several encouraging signs.",1
"So our guidance, Katy is that -- we put our numbers that we believe at this point in time with all the information that is available to us, we're going to land within. So we take into account the fact that weâve seen some purchase delays for executing Q3, but we have seen some safe trends in certain geographies. That continues to happen. And what you see this quarter is that our guidance range is $3 billion, as opposed to $2 billion during the third quarter, just to take into account the fact that we got many moving pieces.",1
"Great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up for Luca. If you could, talk a little bit about the gross margin puts and takes for guidance, 37% to 38%. How are you thinking about commodity pricing and mix of the new products and that just as you look to how you guided gross margin?",1
"From a Didi point of view, we see that as, one, a great financial investment. Two, we think that there are some strategic things that the companies can do together over time. And three, we think that we'll learn a lot about the business and the Chinese market even beyond what we currently know, and Didi has an incredible team there. And so that's the rationale for why we did that. Would we do more investments? Yes, but it's not something that you'll see a whole string of from us. But we will constantly look for things that are smart to do.",1
"In terms of the investment in Didi, it was an unusual investment in that, as you know, we don't have a long history of doing a lot of these, but we have done some before. We invested in ARM in the early days. We invested in Akamai and a few other companies. So it wasn't the first.",1
"Shannon, we obviously invest a ton of capital in our business itself to support research and development and the production of our products. And that's the main source of our capital. However, we're constantly looking on the outside for great talent and great intellectual property. And we have been buying companies on average every three to four weeks or so, and we continue to do that. And we think we've made some really great choices there.",1
"Thank you very much for the question. Tim, can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on investments? You made the Didi investment this quarter. Obviously, you continue to make acquisitions over time. We just saw I guess you invested in buying some of Carpool Karaoke. I'm just curious as to how you're thinking about where you're putting your investment dollars for more of an acquisition or a potential equity stake standpoint as you look at overall capital allocation.",1
"Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on August 11, 2016 to shareholders of record as of August 8, 2016.",1
"As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.050 billion and $6.150 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $350 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%.",1
"We also completed our sixth accelerated share repurchase program, retiring an additional 8.7 million shares. We've now completed almost $177 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $127 billion in share repurchases. During the quarter, we also spent $1 billion on a minority investment in Didi Chuxing in China, completed three acquisitions and incurred $4.2 billion in capital expenditures.",1
"Yes, Katy, it was obviously a surprise also to us. We were expecting obviously a loss in leverage from the sequential declining revenue which obviously happened. We also expect that some unfavorable mix, which also happens -- it's typical as we move away from the launch quarter. And we were expecting some cost improvements. These cost improvements came in. They came in stronger than we were anticipating. The commodity markets continue to be favorable, the product quality continues to be excellent, our teams executed really, really well. And all these things came together at the same time and it was a very nice surprise for us. As we look forward into Q4, yes, weâve guided to 37% to 38%. Again, the mix is the normal mix that we see as we continue to move through the product cycle. And obviously in Q4, we got some transition costs because weâre expecting a very busy fall. We're bit excited about what we've got in the pipeline. And thatâs the reason why we guided to that range.",1
"And then just a follow-up on that last point, because in the press release you referenced the excitement about new products and services. Can you remind us of your guidance philosophy as it relates to product cycles? Do you embed assumptions around the contribution from new products? And if so, do those tend to be more conservative than for products thatâs already shipped today?",1
"We returned a total of over $13 billion to investors during the June quarter as follows. We paid $3.2 billion in dividends and equivalent. We spent $4 billion on repurchases of 41.2 million Apple shares through open-market transactions. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 48.2 million shares.",1
"Now turning to iPad, revenue grew 7%. iPad ASP was $490 compared to $415 in the year-ago quarter, with the increase driven by iPad Pro, and we sold 10 million iPads compared to 10.9 million in the year-ago quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by about 500,000 units and exited the quarter within our five-week to seven-week target range.",1
"We issued a total $2.4 billion of debt in Taiwan and in Australia, while retiring $2.5 billion in U.S. debt, leaving us with $72 billion in term debt at the end of the quarter, essentially unchanged from last quarter.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $231.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decrease of $1.4 billion. $214.8 billion of this cash, or 93% of the total, was outside the United States.",1
Thank you Katy. Can we have the next question please?,1
"With the pockets of market we just noted for tablets, could you give us some more detail on how you are thinking about the category longer term, and in particular in the context of your usage comments, how are you thinking about the competitive landscape now and how that may evolve? And then I guess, related to that, what do you think to be the next driver of renewed growth for the category?",1
That will come from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.,1
"Itâs Tim. If you sort of back up from this, the category that we created, which has just been a little over four years, we have now sold 225 million iPads, which is I think probably a larger number than anyone would have predicted at the time and including ourselves, quite frankly. We still feel that category as a whole is in its early days and that there is also significant innovation that can be brought to the iPad and we plan on doing that. When I look at the top level numbers, I get really excited when I see that more than 50% of the iPads that we're selling are going to someone who is a first time tablet buyer. I get excited when I see that our retail share according to the MPD in the month of June was 59% of UNIX and over 70% in terms of dollars. And of course, Luca has mentioned in his preamble that our education share is 85%.",1
"More broadly, we're making great progress with our enterprise initiatives and we see strong growth opportunities ahead of us. In May, we announced a global strategic partnership with SAP to reimagine business processes with native iOS apps. SAP is the world's largest enterprise software provider, with more than 130 million potential users among its 300,000 global customers. In fact, it's estimated that 76% of global business transactions touch an SAP system. Our partnership will deliver an SDK to fast-track iOS projects for SAP environments, an iOS academy to enable the 2.5 million SAP developers around the world to build great native iOS apps, and a portfolio of industry-specific apps to accelerate mobile transformation in the enterprise.",1
"We also are in the -- virtually all Fortune 500 companies, we are in 99% of them to be exact and 93% of the Global 500. However, when we dig into the business market deeper, though our market share in the U.S., in the commercial sector is good at 76% -- this is according to IDC; the penetration in business is low. Itâs only 20%. And to put that in some kind of context, if you looked at penetration of notebooks in business, it would be over 60%. And so we think that there is a substantial upside in business. And this was one of the thinkings behind the partnership with IBM that we announced last week. We think that the core thing that unleashes this is a better go to market, which IBM clearly brings to the table, but even more importantly apps that are written with Mobile First in mind. Not all but many of the enterprises apps that have been written for iPad have been essentially ports from a desktop arrangement and havenât taken full advantage of mobile.",1
"One recent example of iPad business adoption is Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, which is adding 22,000 iPads to more than 10,000 purchased last year to deploy corporate mobility solutions across the organization and enable its consultants to serve customers in a more engaging and more efficient way.",1
"In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the overall U.S. tablet market in the June quarter and has 84% share of tablets priced above $200. And in May, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini and a 95% rate for iPad Air. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 63% plan to purchase an iPad, almost four times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured, with iPad Pro the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers report a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 71% for the September quarter.",1
Now I'd like to hand it over to Luca to share more details with you on the June quarter.,1
"From UBS, we will hear from Steve Milunovich.",1
Tim you mentioned that Japan was fairly flat due to regulations and taxes. Could you elaborate on that and what kind of comparisons perhaps you see going forward?,1
We will hear from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.,1
"We face some challenges in Greater China, as the economic environment has slowed down since the beginning of the year. This is reflected in consumer confidence and retail spending, and the Chinese yuan has depreciated by 7% relative to the U.S. dollar since August of last year. Hong Kong's tourism and retail businesses also continue to be significantly impacted by the stronger Hong Kong dollar relative to other Asian currencies.",1
"Switchers and first-time smartphone buyers represented the lion's share of our iPhone sales in the quarter, and our installed base of iPhones in China has grown by 34% over the last year alone. According to China Mobile, there are more iPhones on their network than any other brand, with iPhone users ranking first in terms of customer loyalty, data usage and ARPU. By far, the largest portion of our global channel inventory reduction was in Greater China, so our underlying business there is stronger than our results imply.",1
"On a personal note, during the past quarter I visited China and India, and I am very encouraged about our growth prospects in those countries. We remain very optimistic about the long-term opportunities in Greater China and we continue to invest there. We opened our 41st Greater China retail store during the quarter, and we also made a $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing.",1
"I am sorry, just really quick on the IBM. Does this say something about Apple doing more in Big Data, and taking a cut maybe of some of the analytics opportunities as well?",1
"Apple Watch continues to be the best-selling smartwatch in the world. And just this month, J.D. Power ranked it highest in customer satisfaction among all smartwatches. With watchOS 3 coming this fall, customers will be able to update their Apple Watches with an enhanced user interface, significantly improved performance and all-new fitness and health capabilities, including activity sharing. We're just getting started with the Apple Watch, and we look forward to even more exciting announcements in this space.",1
"We had our best iPad compare in 10 quarters, with revenue growing 7% thanks to the rollout of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. We're proud to have the most exciting lineup of tablets and accessories in the world and exceptionally high customer satisfaction and engagement. Our surveys also show that about half of iPad Pro purchases are buying them for work. iPad Pro is the ultimate upgrade for existing iPad users and the ultimate replacement device for customers switching from PC notebooks.",1
"Yes, we didnât talk about how the business model is going to work. But generally speaking, I think that each of us have revenue streams in the enterprise and each of us went from having those revenue streams. So thatâs how I look at that. And we win if we can drive that penetration number I spoke about from 20% to 60%. That would be incredibly exciting here. The walls would shake. And so thatâs what I hope for.",1
"We saw tremendous performance from our Services businesses, which grew 19% to a June quarter record of $6 billion. The growth was broad-based, with App Store revenue up 37% to a new all-time high, in addition to strong increases in Music, iCloud, and AppleCare. In the last 12 months, our Services revenue is up almost $4 billion year on year to $23.1 billion, and we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 company next year. Most of our terrific Services performance during the quarter was fueled by our active installed base of devices, with installed base-related purchases of $10.3 billion accelerating to 29% growth year on year.",1
"Overall, we added millions of first-time smartphone buyers in the June quarter, and switchers accounted for the highest percentage of quarterly iPhone sales we've ever measured. In absolute terms, our year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we've seen in any nine-month period, and our active installed base of iPhones is up strong double-digits year over year.",1
Thank you Ben. Could we have the next question please?,1
Ben Schachter - Macquarie,1
"Yes, it was actually Luca, but I can comment on it. VAT was increased from 5% to 8% close to the beginning of the quarter. I think it was actually April 1 or so. That was the first planned VAT increase. There are other or at least one additional planned VAT increase in the future. This was a part of the overall tax reform package in Japan. Secondly, the carriers received some guidance from the regulators to essentially stop incenting people to transfer from another carrier at a higher amount than they were incenting their -- retaining their own customers. And so it appears that the combination of these two things dampened the whole market for smartphones in Japan.",1
"In both cases, that strategy is working. Our initial sales data tells us that the iPhone SE is popular in both developed and emerging markets, and the percentage of iPhone SE sales going to customers who are new to iPhone is greater than we've seen in the first weeks of availability for other iPhones launched in the last several years.",1
"Tim, I just wanted to talk about the app market for Enterprise. Right now I believe that app developers can sell to the enterprise directly and therefore that they can bypass sharing revenue from these app sales with Apple. Is Apple going to allow that to continue, and can you also just more broadly discuss how Apple thinks about the opportunity to sell apps directly to the enterprise?",1
"We had a very successful global launch of iPhone SE, and demand outstripped supply throughout the quarter. We brought on additional capacity and were able to achieve supply/demand balance as we entered the September quarter. At its launch, we said that the addition of the iPhone SE to the iPhone lineup placed us in a better position to meet the needs of customers who love a four-inch phone and to attract even more customers into our ecosystem.",1
"We have no plans to change the rules with Enterprise. Some enterprises like proprietary apps that they do not want to offer to others and so we obviously have a way for them to distribute those into their enterprise or just the employees that they want to and so I'm not worried about changing that. Weâre also taking friction out of the system and not adding it. Again, the big thing for us is getting the penetration number, I think getting our product, iPhones and iPads and Macs in more people hands and we think there is a huge opportunity in Enterprise to do that.",1
"Thank you Ben.

"iPhone accounted for the vast majority of the channel inventory reduction. iPhone unit sell-through was down just 8% year on year, an even greater improvement over the March quarter than we predicted, and we expect the September quarter sell-through comparison to improve further. We feel good about our channel inventory levels and believe they position us well for the months ahead.",1
"Revenue of $42.4 billion was near the high end of our guidance range and gross margin of 38% was at the top of our guidance range. We achieved these results while reducing channel inventory by about $3.6 billion, significantly more than the $2 billion inventory reduction we had expected. So our sell-through was markedly greater than our sell-in.",1
"Good day everyone, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri, and after that we'll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2014, the Form 10-Q for the first two quarters of fiscal 2015 and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Combining this backdrop with the tough comparison to last year, when revenue grew 112%, and the channel inventory reduction this year, we're reporting a decline in revenue in the June quarter. But to keep things in perspective, when we look back on our accomplishments in this segment over the last couple of years, they are truly remarkable. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our total revenue from Greater China was almost $40 billion, up 55% from the same timeframe just two years ago, while iPhone units were up 47%.",1
"India is now one of our fastest growing markets. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our iPhone sales in India were up 51% year on year. We just announced a first of its kind design and development accelerator to support Indian developers creating innovative applications for iOS, and we opened a new office in Hyderabad to accelerate maps development. We're looking forward to opening retail stores in India down the road, and we see huge potential for that vibrant country.",1
"And so with Beats we felt we were getting an incredible subscription service, a very rare set of talent that we think can do great things in Apple and access to a very fast growing businesses in their headphone and earphone space. And culturally we felt there was a match and music has been deeply embedded in Appleâs DNA for many, many years. And so it was a great marriage and I think the partnership with IBM is a great marriage as well. Itâs more like that, presented themselves -- or I think we can manage more things. I think that we have a very, very strong executive team and can do that. But itâs not my goal to acquire certain number of companies or spend a certain amount of money. We want to do things that help us make great products that are great for our customers and so forth.",1
"As we look forward to the fall, we are thrilled by customers' response to the software and services we previewed at our Worldwide Developers Conference last month. This was our biggest WWDC ever. And for the first time, we have four innovative Apple platforms for our developers' apps, iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. In fact, iOS 10 will be the biggest release ever for iOS.",1
"Innovations like these are the kinds of things that only Apple can do. We have an incredible lineup of products in our pipeline, and I'm very bullish about our long-term opportunity.",1
"With our latest OS releases, the unparalleled continuity across Apple devices will become even more powerful. For example, macOS Sierra will sense other devices and use secure protocols to communicate. With an authenticated Apple Watch, I can auto-unlock my Mac when I open it without typing a password. With Universal Clipboard, I can copy and paste text, images, and even video between my iOS devices and my Mac. And I can automatically access the files on my Mac desktop and documents folder from another Mac, iOS device, or even a PC.",1
"We havenât been able to get very detailed data on share but my expectation is we're not going to see very much of a share change. And we are beginning to see some coming back of that market as we step into this quarter, may be not back to the level that it was previously but you can begin to see the market growing again which we view as very positive. In the past when we've seen these type of things, tax changes et cetera, there is usually a rush to buy before the tax increase, a pause that happens thereafter and then the market eventually goes back to some kind of steady state that may not be exactly where it was but it nears it. And so I think thatâs likely our guts or thatâs what happens on the VAT side. The other piece is a little harder to conclude what will happen in terms of that guidance and how long that might be employed. I donât know that part.",1
"Okay, thatâs very helpful. And then you talked about your three tiers of iPhones. I wonder if you would be willing to breakout in any more detail the growth and particularly how to defend the 5C in the mid-tier. I know our surveys continue to find in the U.S. that it's falling little bit as a percentage of business but you seem to believe itâs doing exactly what you expected it to do.",1
"Leading financial partners tell us that three out of four contactless payments in the U.S. are made with Apple Pay. This is amazing. There are more than 11 million contactless-ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay is available today, including 3 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States. With the launch of France, Switzerland, and Hong Kong this month, Apple Pay is now live in nine markets, including six of our top 10. Adoption outside the U.S. has been explosive, with over half of transaction volume now coming from non-U.S. markets.",1
"This fall we'll also bring Apple Pay to Safari so users can easily make secure and private purchases when shopping on participating websites. Tens of millions of users around the world are enjoying Apple Pay today at stores and in app, with estimated monthly active users up more than 450% year on year last month.",1
"I can tell you this. That if you look at the growth rates, we donât divide out each one but if you look at year-over-year growth rates and so this would be comparing the 5C to last year. It would be comparing the 4S, which was in the mid-tier. The growth in that sector was the highest growth during the quarter we just finished.",1
"We're also using machine learning in many other ways across our products and services, including recommending songs, apps, and news. Machine learning is improving facial and image recognition in photos, predicting word choice while typing in messages and mail, and providing context awareness in maps for better directions. Deep learning within our products even enables them to recognize usage patterns and improve their own battery life. And most importantly, we deliver these intelligent services while protecting users' privacy. Most of the AI processing takes place on the device rather than being sent to the cloud. And starting this fall, we'll be using sophisticated technology called differential privacy, enhancing our ability to deliver the kinds of services we dream of and customers love without compromising on the individual privacy our customers have come to expect from us.",1
Of the three tiers?,1
Of the three tiers. And so we are extremely happy with how it performed last quarter.,1
"These experiences become more powerful and intuitive as we continue our long history of enriching our products through advanced artificial intelligence. We have focused our AI efforts on the features that best enhance the customer experience. For example, machine learning enables Siri to understand words as well as the intent behind them. That means Siri does a better job understanding and even predicting what you want, then delivering the right responses to requests. To make Siri an even smarter assistant, we're opening the service to developers, and this fall Siri will be available across our entire product line.",1
"Thanks. I have just one question for Luca and one for Tim. And for Luca, you mentioned that commodity pricing, I guess the environment was good for you. Is it your working assumption in your guidance that continued to be favorable and a tailwind for you? And then my question for Tim is, with the installment plans that are being introduced in the U.S., I imagine that given the increases in flexibility for people to operate faster, would you expect that to happen? Are you seeing any evidence as these contests come up because we've had them out now for several months? And how do you see that impacting your business because obviously the U.S. iPhone part of your business is still very significant and it can be quite a big catalyst to your iPhone business going forward I would imagine or would you be more tensed in how these are playing out?",1
"I will take both of these. This is Tim. On the component question, what we saw in the June quarter was that NAND, mobile DRAM and LCD, the pricing on all of those declined, while PC DRAM increased, despite the market for PCs contracting. In the September quarter, what is factored in our guidance is that LCDs and mobile DRAM continue to decline, that NAND pricing remains essentially flat last quarter and that PC DRAM has a slight price increase. And in terms of other commodities that I didnât talk about, we've assumed that they would decline at historical rates and so thatâs factored into the gross margin guidance that Luca gave you. In terms of the installment plans that you mentioned in the U.S. relative to iPhone, there is a lot of different models that are being tried in the U.S. and throughout the world. And actually last quarter, as we estimated and this is subject to estimating but we're estimating that less than one out of four iPhones were sold on a traditional subsidy plan. And so that number is markedly different than it would have been two years ago.",1
"There are also beautifully redesigned apps for music, maps and news, significant enhancements to HomeKit, CarPlay, and the Health app, building on our strategy to give users a seamless experience in all aspects of their lives. There's also a major update with macOS Sierra, with new features like Siri and Apple Pay that make the Mac smarter and more helpful than ever, and even stronger continuity features across all the Apple devices.",1
"The installment plan that you're speaking about which gives the customer the right to upgrade SAP or faster than a usual two year cycle, we think that plays to our customer base in a large way. And so that makes us incredibly bullish that customers on those plans would be very likely to upgrade when we announce a new product.",1
"Thank you, Kulbinder. May we have a next question please?",1
"Customers can look forward to more expressive ways to communicate with messages now with its own App Store, allowing users to create and share content, make payments, add stickers and more, all without leaving messages, which is now one of the largest messaging services in the world. Customers can also look forward to a broader and more intelligent role for Siri, which will work with your favorite apps from the App Store, so you can ask Siri to book a ride with your favorite ride sharing app or send money to someone with Square.",1
Next we'll hear from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.,1
"Thanks a lot. Tim, questions for you. I guess during the quarter you did two very big things in our opinion, obviously buying Beats, biggest acquisition in your history and you also did this IBM deal, which obviously was in this quarter, but since the last call, and that was very interesting, obviously really collaborating with another huge company to get further into the enterprise. And I was just wondering, what are you seeing in Apple thatâs changing? These seem like big deals that change your direction a bit, something that you wouldnât have done in the past. And do you see a lot more partnerships and larger acquisitions on the horizon to grow your TAM in various markets?",1
"Well, I think we have a lot of really great people and I think we have the capability. As I've said before, I think we have the capability to acquire a sizable company and manage it. And relative to IBM, I feel the same way. I think you can only do so many partnerships well, and so it is unusual that we enter into a partnership. But in this particular case, I think arguably the companies are so complementary, and I've gotten to know Gini fairly well over the last couple of years and I think we see the importance of the customer, a lot of the same way and both feel that Mobile and Enterprise is just an enormous opportunity. And weâre not competing with each other. And so I think a partnership in that case is particularly great. Would we do more of either of the things we did? Weâre always looking in the acquisition space, but we donât let our money burn a hole in our pocket and we donât do things that arenât strategic.",1
"The momentum of all four platforms shows the strong relationship Apple enjoys with customers throughout their day and wherever they go, whether it's at home, in their car, at work, or everywhere in between. The Apple ecosystem is thriving and growing, and our new OS releases this fall will take these great experiences to a new level.",1
Now most importantly of all of this is that customer sat is off the charts because we've constantly seen if you can get the customer sat off the charts you can wind up doing fairly well over time. We've also learned a lot about managing quite an assortment and so forth. And so I sort of back up and look at this and I feel fantastic about what the team has done and delivered and I know I never go anywhere without the Watch and it's not because I'm the CEO of Apple. I'm that attached to it and I get lots of notes from a lot of people that feel the same way. And so that's how I look at the Watch.,1
"We generated $53.3 billion of revenue with year-over-year growth in all of our geographic segments and new June quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. We grew in each of our top 15 markets, with especially strong performance in the U.S., Hong Kong, Russia, Mexico, the Middle East and Africa, all places where revenue was up by more than 20%.",1
"Turning to iPad, we sold 11.4 million units, up 15% over last year. We were happy to see iPad growth in each of our geographic segments, with strong double-digit increases in key markets such as the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, and Greater China. We exited the quarter within our five to seven-week target range for iPad channel inventory.",1
"Well, I don't want to make a forever comment, but there are -- we are a product company and we love making the whole thing. And because if we can -- on the user experience in that way and with the goal of delighting the user. And that's the reason that we're doing the Apple Silicon is because we can envision some products that we can achieve with Apple Silicon that we couldn't achieve otherwise. And so that's how we look at it.",1
"Well, as you've seen, obviously, we've had a sequential expansion in gross margin for services. And that was driven primarily by mix as you said, right. We have a very broad portfolio and depending on which one of the services does better than we have an impact on Services gross margins. We like the Services business because it is -- it's a recurring type of revenue and the margins are accretive to company margin. We did over 67% this quarter, but we want to offer very competitive services across the board and the same -- I think I'm going to make the same comments that I made on products. What matters to us is to be successful with everything that we do and provide great products and services to our customers. So the relative success of our products and services in the marketplace will drive to a certain extent with our margins are, that's the margins are a byproduct of our success in the marketplace.",1
"Got it, really appreciate that. And I wanted to ask question on the Wearables segment. It seems to me that you're categorizing the Wearables business as maybe being a little bit impact from pandemic similar to the iPhones. And it's the first time that Wearables hasn't materially upsided and at least a while in recent memory. I guess the drivers of the Wearables being Watch and predominantly Watch and AirPods. What are your thoughts going forward on whether there is a little bit of pent-up demand perhaps that might resume ads that will get back to a more normalized environment?",1
"I think on the Watch in particular is like the iPhone more affected by store closures, because people -- some people want to try on the Watch and see what it looks like, look at different band choices and those sorts of things. And so I think as stores closed, it puts more pressure on that. I was -- we did come out sort of the way we told you last quarter, we were going to come out from the color that we gave you. So we knew things would decelerate because of the closures. So we will end up being, we're very pleased with how we did. But the store closures definitely affect the wearables and the iPhone.",1
"Thank you, Jeriel.",1
Got it. Really appreciate that.,1
"Yes. Can we have the next question, please?",1
That will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup.,1
"Thank you very much. And I have two questions. I'll ask them at the same time and it's one for Tim and one for Luca. Tim, the coronavirus, your company has done a fantastic job at overcoming one of the hurdles. So congratulations to you. As you look forward, say to the Christmas holiday shopping season, and given the economic challenges around the world of virus, coronavirus and your product launches and things like that. Can you give me commentary maybe how this Christmas you're looking forward, to say, maybe some past cycles of Christmas? Because it just seems like it's a little bit different, but Apple is really showing a lot more strength coming into this Christmas than may be some of the past years.",1
"And then for Luca, I think you made a quick comment, Luca, that you mentioned something about a few weeks later, was Apple like iPhone, iPhone chips or product launches or maybe expand upon that. I know things are more difficult, but I didn't quite keep the commentary, it was in your prepared comments, we'll go about a few weeks late that let's just have a quick little blood. Thank you so much, gentlemen.",1
"Yes, we take it one quarter at a time. And so, we'll give you color on the December quarter and October. Generally speaking, I think we need to see a vaccine or therapeutic or both. And there is some optimism around that and in that particular timeframe. And so, we'll see, I don't have any information that is publicly available there. But I think that would boost consumer confidence quite a bit if it begins to happen and I think that any kind of consumer style company would benefit from that.",1
"And Jim, on the iPhone, I said in my remarks that we launched a year ago, we launched the new iPhone in late September. So I was referring to the new product. And I said that this year, the supply of the new product will be a few weeks later than that.",1
Great. Congratulations to you and your entire organization and teams. Thank you so much.,1
That will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.,1
"Hi. Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you can maybe comment on the penetration of Apple Card users in the iOS installed base? And have you seen any change in the buying behavior of Apple Card users in terms of accelerating spend on more Apple products and services? Then I have a follow-on.",1
"We saw changes in consumer spending as the shutdowns occurred and the store closures occurred, we could see that across the Card. It affected the categories that you would guess the most like travel and entertainment et cetera. But overall if you sort of pull the lens out on the Apple Card, we're very happy with the number of people that have Apple Card. We believe based on what we've heard that it's the fastest rollout in the history of credit cards and so we feel very good about that.",1
"Yes, thank you so much. I have two questions as well. I'd like to focus on the gross margin expansion within the services line all-time record for the quarter. I'm just curious whether you think that will sustain, I understand within services is a pretty wide range of gross margins by business, and I'm wondering if that should continue to improve.",1
That will be from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank.,1
"And then we'll see, I mean, we've taken an approach that we try to understand how the virus is evolving over time. We've taken a very cautious approach of both with our corporate facilities and with our retail stores. I think what you've seen with retail stores is that we have reopened in number of geographies around the world. We've reopened here in the United States. We've had to re-close some of the stores yet here in the United States, as the number of cases has gone up. And we will continue to track how the virus is doing. And hopefully at some point, we're going to get to a point where there is a vaccine or there is a cure. And so we will make those decisions as we get more information.",1
"Okay, great, thanks. And one more if I may. Congrats again on the strong iPad and Mac results, that's really impressive. I guess the obvious question is, should we ever think about how much of that might be pull-forward and what might be the future upgrades in next few years? Anything else you can share on how you think about growth from here or whether there is a hangover period maybe after the back-to-school season or holiday season. That would be helpful. Thanks.",1
"Perfect, that's helpful. And then I guess, Luca, if I could just follow up with you. I'd love to get your perspective on how do we think about the overall 38% gross margins? What do you think of the levers to improve this as you go forward, not really September quarter, but over the next one to two years? And in that context, do you see a point where the product gross margin starts to stabilize because they have been trending somewhat lower for the last couple of quarters now.",1
"Yes. Well, let me start with what we've seen during the June quarter. We were at 38%, we were down slightly sequentially but up the same amount on a year-over-year basis. And really the big negative impact that we felt for several quarters now has been the strength of the US dollar, so the foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis was 90 basis points on a year-over-year basis was 130 basis points. So obviously that is something to keep in mind.",1
"And then, the other aspect; I think it's always important to keep in mind, Amit, is that we sell many different products. They have different margin profiles. And so sometimes a different mix can have an impact on the aggregate level of products gross margins and we are very pleased to see the performance of Mac, iPad and Wearables but obviously, it's a different mix. Going forward, the variables are always the same, is that the foreign exchange will continue to play an impact, the mix of products there, we're going to be selling, will have an impact as well. The commodities market has been relatively benign and we'll see how that plays out over time. As you know now for several years, we've been managing gross margin, I would say, fairly well in spite of some difficult situations like the one with the strength of the dollar and we plan to continue to make a good trade off decisions between revenue and units and margins.",1
It will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.,1
"Hi, thanks a lot for the question. Our team in Asia recently, we did some survey work on smartphones in China. It showed that there is still a high proportion of the installed bases on 6, 7, 8 devices. I know you talked about the trade-in programs and promotions that you've been doing there. I wonder if you can tell us whether there is anything else that you're doing to get these customers in your latest technology? What made those customers be looking for and how should we think about when an upgrade cycle might come on more strongly there in China? Thanks.",1
"Customers upgraded different at a different pace and I don't have in front of me the exact installed base data from China. But much like in other geographies, the upgrades have extended some, it extended some during the depths if you will of the pandemic in China and the rest of the world, and probably to some degree is happening still at this point. The key things that we can do is keep innovating, deliver product that people can't imagine, going through life about. And obviously keep rolling out these programs that makes the front-end purchase be much less, and this is things like the financing in the trade-in programs that you mentioned. And I do feel like those are going quite good in a number of geographies.",1
"The installed base is growing and the new customer numbers that Luca went over in the aggregate are still very high in the close to 50% kind of range. And so, that to me, makes the -- bodes well for the future. There is clearly, as we had indicated, there is some amount of work from home and remote learning that do affect the results of Mac and iPad positively. They probably affect wearables and iPhone, the other direction. And -- but on Mac and iPad, these are productivity tools that people are using to stay engaged with their work or stay engaged with their school work. And we believe we're going to have a strong back to school season. Sitting here today, it certainly looks like that.",1
"Well, on the OpEx front, there are being obviously certain things that have been affected in terms of cost reductions. Obviously, travel, it is a perfect example. The number of meetings that we have internally, some of those costs have been reduced. We've also invested heavily in initiatives for example, we're really trying to help during a very difficult circumstances. For example, we have had a program for example where we match our employee donations, we made donations directly as a company around the world to many institutions and governments. On a net basis, I would say probably the cost have outweighed the savings both during the March and the June quarter, but we think it's absolutely the right thing to do. From an employee perspective, what we said so far is that here in the United States, in most -- the majority of our population will continue to work from home until the end of the year.",1
"Thank you, Kyle.",1
Great. Thanks very much.,1
That will come from Cleveland Research's Ben Bollin.,1
"Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I was hoping you could share a little bit about where you think channel inventory is? You talked about the tightness you saw exiting the June quarter for Mac and iPad. Interested, where you think inventory is across major product categories. And then I had a follow-up for Luca.",1
"We usually -- we've gotten away from talking about channel inventories. But to give you a perspective sitting here looking at it, on iPhone the inventory is slightly less than it was a year ago and that's I'm saying that at a quarter end point, so at the end of Q3. And obviously iPad and Mac are constrained and so both of those are less than they were in the year ago quarter.",1
"Okay. And then, Luca, I'm interested, any color you could share about the impact COVID had on OpEx in the quarter, be it work from home, stipends, travel, other employee support costs. And also how the company is thinking about the longer-term opportunity of employees working remotely maybe more permanently many considerations and how that could influence the future OpEx? Thanks.",1
"Okay. Thanks, Tim. And as a follow-up, now that Apple has Apple Silicon for Macs. Would you ever consider monetizing this as a merchant silicon vendor or is this going to be forever for Apple use?",1
"Thank you, Wamsi. A replay of today's call will be available for two-week on Apple podcasts as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. The numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. Please enter confirmation code 2630782. These replays will be available by approximately 5:00 PM Pacific Time today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414. Financial analysts can contact me with additional questions at 669-227-2402. Thank you again for joining us.",1
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start-off with the announcement at WWDC around the independent App Stores for the Watch and the iPad. What level of interest have you seen from developers and how are they thinking about the ability to monetize services independently on those App Stores? And how does that help you position wearables more firmly into the health and fitness category?,1
"And again, that will conclude today's conference.",1
"In the health space, our new health sharing feature will make it easier than ever to securely share your health data to share your health data with loved ones. That includes new capabilities like walking steadiness, which uses sensors to assess user stability doing everyday tasks, and recommends exercises to improve stability and avoid a fall.",1
"In the belief that privacy is a fundamental human right, we share new features in iOS 15 that continue to drive our progress forward, from mail privacy protection, which stops invisible pixels and an email from tracking your mail activity to App Privacy Report, which helps users check on the apps they've granted permission to use their personal data.",1
"We also introduced some incredible next generation technologies coming to the accessibility space. From assistive touch, which helps people with limb differences navigate Apple Watch to new voiceover capabilities to help blind and low vision users, accessibility remains a bedrock principle for us, in the simple belief that the best technology for the world should be the best technology for everyone.",1
"But the responsibility to be a force for good in the lives of others extends beyond the technology we made, so the teachers and students shaping our future. This quarter as part of our racial equity and justice initiative, we awarded innovation grants to engineering schools at four historically black colleges and universities to expand their coursework, scholarships and internship opportunities in hardware engineering and silicon chip design.",1
"We see education as a great equalizing force, and we're more dedicated than ever to supporting the educators, advocates and students lining the path and leading the way. That includes the 350 swift student challenge winners, we recognized at this year's WWDC. If you ever need a dose of hope or inspiration, I can't say enough about our students' scholarship winners, whose apps bring so much good into the world, from teaching other young people to code to helping volunteers deliver groceries to people at high risk of COVID-19.",1
"Young people's innovations remind us that our collective future is bound up in the next generations' passion for solving global challenges, and of the responsibility we have to join them in building a better world.",1
"Turning to our own backyard, we're continuing to press forward in our efforts to help bring more affordable housing to the Bay Area and across California. This month, we shared that we've contributed more than $1 billion to help first time homeowners and construct 1000s of new affordable housing units across the state. And we're continuing to stay focused on supporting the global response to the pandemic and delivering the best products and services for people.",1
"Our greatest source of inspiration is a technology itself, but how people use it in their own lives, in ways great and small, to write a novel or to read one, to care for an ailing patient or see a doctor virtually, to track their heart rate on a jog or to train for the Olympics. Every day, I'm grateful for the dedication of our teams to the simple mission of creating technology that improves people's lives. And I want to thank everyone at Apple for the purpose and passion they bring to that mission.",1
"With that, I'll hand it over to Luca for a deeper dive on our performance this quarter.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to report record June quarter financial results, which reflect the importance of our products and services in our customers lives and our strong underlying operating performance.",1
"Our revenue reached a June quarter record of $81.4 billion, an increase of nearly $22 billion or 36% from a year ago. We grew double digits in each of our product categories, with an all-time record for services, and June quarter records for iPhone, Mac, and Wearables, Home and Accessories. We also set new June quarter records in every geographic segment with very strong double digit growth in each one of them.",1
"Products revenue was a June quarter record of $63.9 billion, up 37% over a year ago. This level of sales performance, combined with the unmatched loyalty of our customers drove our installed base of active devices to a new all-time record. Our services set an all-time revenue record of $17.5 billion up 33% over a year ago, with June quarter records in each geographic segment. Company gross margin was 43.3%, up 80 basis points from last quarter driven by cost savings and a higher mix of services, partially offset by seasonal loss of leverage.",1
"Products gross margin was 36% down 10 basis points sequentially, a seasonal loss of leverage was almost entirely offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 69.8% down 30 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. Net income of $21.7 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.30, and operating cash flow of $21.1 billion were all June quarter records by a wide margin.",1
"Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue set a June quarter record of $39.6 billion growing 50% year-over-year and exceeding our own expectations, as the iPhone 12 family continued to be in very high demand. Performance was consistently strong across the world, and we grew very strong double digits in each geographic segment, setting June quarter records in most markets we track.",1
"Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high, thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and the strength of our ecosystem. In the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 97% for the iPhone 12 family.",1
"That begins with innovative new features that help users stay connected with one another, like share play and spatial audio for FaceTime, or disconnect when they need a break like focus, which limits distracting notifications when you're winding down for bed or concentrating at work. And new productivity features make iPad an even more useful tool for multitasking, helping users navigate across apps, split their screen or use quick note to capture a thought the moment inspiration strikes.",1
"Much like the developer community, we are diehard optimist, about technology's potential to help people live happier, healthier and more fulfilled lives, goals that shine through with powerful new updates coming to iOS, iPad OS, Mac OS, and Watch OS this fall.",1
"Today's investments in education and coding translate to tomorrow's small businesses and groundbreaking new apps. The next act of an app economy, already creating jobs and opportunity around the world. In June, a new study by the analysis group found that it was another record year for App Store developers, whose combined billings and sales increased by 24% to $643 billion in 2020. The app economy continues to be an incredible engine of prosperity and opportunity, fueled by the ceaseless striving for developers to make apps that enrich people's lives.",1
"In the midst of that enduring adversity, we are especially humbled that our technology has continued to play a key role in keeping our customers connected. Just last month, it was great to be back with our teams and customers for the opening of our newest retail store in Los Angeles, our Apple Tower Theater. It was a hopeful reminder of the energy and sense of community, shared spaces bring and how appreciative we all are now of the simple privilege of talking to one another face to face.",1
"Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q3 FY 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.",1
I'd like now to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.,1
"Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, Apple is reporting a very strong quarter with double digit revenue growth across our product and services categories, and in every geographic segment. We set a new June quarter revenue record of $81.4 billion, up 36% from last year, and the vast majority of markets we tracked grew double digits, with especially strong growth in emerging markets including India, Latin America, and Vietnam.",1
"Total retail sales also set a June quarter record, and almost all of our retail stores have now opened their doors. This quarter saw a growing sense of optimism from consumers in the United States and around the world, driving renewed hope for a better future and for all that innovation can make possible.",1
"But as the last 18-months had demonstrated many times before, progress made is not progress guaranteed. An uneven recovery to the pandemic and a Delta variant surging in many countries around the world have shown us once again, that the road to recovery will be a winding one.",1
"As we look forward to more in-person interactions in the future, we're doubling down on innovation, and doing all we can to help chart a course to a healthier and more equitable world. I'll have more to say about our work in those areas a bit later on. But first, let's turn to our product and services categories.",1
"Last month, we shared many exciting new features at WWDC. But more powerful than any of them was the incredible showing of developers from all walks of life and around the world. The new tools we announced will help developers harness cutting edge technologies, like augmented reality, reach new users and customize their experience on the App Store, or learn to update or invent an app with Swift, Apple's powerful and intuitive programming language.",1
"For iPhone, this quarter saw very strong double digit growth in each geographic segment, and we continue to be heartened by our customer's response to the iPhone 12 lineup. We're only in the early innings of 5G, but already its incredible performance and speed have made a significant impact on how people can get the most out of our technology.",1
"Customers love iPhone 12 for its superfast 5G speeds, A14 Bionic chip and Adobe vision camera never seen before in a phone. Users continue to rely on iPad and Mac to work, learn, create and connect. iPad had its highest June quarter in nearly a decade, while Mac set an all-time June quarter record.",1
"We've seen a great response to the new iMac and iPad Pro, both powered by the M1 chips exceptional speed and power efficient performance. The iMacâs remarkable thin design and vibrant colors have made it a favorite for users everywhere. And the iPad continues to be an incredibly versatile tool in our user's toolbox, inspiring creativity and connection and keeping us entertained and productive in equal measure.",1
"It was another very strong quarter for wearables, home and accessories, which set a new June quarter record, while helping people find more ways to stay entertained, healthy and connected at home and on the go. Apple Watch remains a go to choice for users to stay on top of their health and reach their fitness goals. And our newest accessory AirTag began shipping to an enthusiastic response from customers, making the find my network more useful than ever, while protecting user privacy.",1
"Turning to services, which set a new all-time revenue record as we continue to roll out innovative new features and programming. We're proud to be the recipients of 35 Emmy Nominations this year, which speaks to the quality of our programming, and an enthusiastic reception from customers and critics alike. Apple TV+ users are loving series like Mythic Quest, and anticipating groundbreaking films like Coda, which premieres next month. And of course, Ted Lasso kicked off season two just last week, and continues to win over viewers with its heartwarming message about the power of community, compassion and hope.",1
"We also introduced Apple Podcast subscriptions, a global marketplace for users to discover exclusive content and support their favorite creators. And we launched spatial audio for Apple Music, a cinematic listening experience that promises to change how music fans listen, and musicians create even more immersive, layered, and beautiful songs.",1
"I think, Amit, it's a combination of a strong launch with iPhone SE and some -- probably some pick up because of the economic stimulus that hit different countries at different points in time. And probably some of the reopening that took place across the quarter, particularly in May and June as Store started to reopen. And so it's a combination of all of those. And as you know, we've been having a strong cycle with the iPhone 11 and the 11 Pro. And so when you combine the -- a strong cycle plus and iPhone SE launch, plus the reopening of the stores, et cetera, I think there were a lot of things that we're going in the right direction there.",1
"Thanks a lot for taking my question guys. I have one and a follow-up as well. Fortunately, I guess, Tim, if I think about the strength, you're seeing with iPhones right now, do you have a sense in terms of where is this trend coming from? Is it more replacement cycles getting shorter or which is getting new customers into the iOS ecosystem because, clearly these growth rates seem fairly impressive in the context of a pandemic and upcoming refresh cycle that we have?",1
"Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question please.",1
"Thanks. Yes, I mean, what we will end up -- what we'll end up with is a common architecture across all of our products, which gives us some interesting things that we can do in products that are -- that is sort of unleashes another round of innovation. And so I don't want to say a lot about it, other than we are extremely excited about it, it's something that we've worked on quite a while to get to this point and we're looking forward to shipping the first Mac with Apple Silicon later in the year.",1
"We do not have a zero-sum approach to prosperity and especially in times like this, we are focused on growing the pie, making sure our success isn't just our success and that everything we make, build or do is geared towards creating opportunities for others. The App Store is a great example. This quarter, a new study by independent economists at the Analysis Group founded the App Store facilitated more than 0.5 trillion in commerce globally in 2019 alone. Especially in a time of COVID-19, you can measure economic resilience in the ways in which the App Store supports remote ordering for restaurants, digital commerce for small businesses and an enduring entrepreneurial opportunity for creators and visionaries. Keeping learning vibrant and impactful in the time of COVID-19 is a priority everyone shares.",1
"Earlier this month, we announced significant enhancements to the development Swift and Everyone Can Code curricula and we launched a new professional learning course available exclusively to educators. In just two weeks ago, our Community Education initiative added 10 more historically black college and university regional coding centers to our roster, bringing the total to 24 locations nationwide, 12 of which are HBCUs and 21 of which serve majority black and brown student populations.",1
"In Apple's backyard, we announced that we are allocating $400 million of our multi-year $2.5 billion affordable housing commitment to new housing construction, homebuyer assistance programs and support for those at greatest risk of experiencing homelessness across Silicon Valley. Apple's results this quarter are only possible due to our people and their ongoing ingenuity, flexibility, resilience and determination during these ever-changing times.",1
"I want to thank our AppleCare and retail teams who have paired exceptional service during a time of intense demand with great adaptability during a quarter where stores have reopened in some places and reclosed in others. A dedicated team of specialists and experts has shouldered the task of caring for the well-being of our teams and communities store by store, location by location with evidence driven granularity and agility that is unrivaled anywhere. Innovation from adversity certainly define this year's Worldwide Developers Conference as well. This is an event where traditionally Apple's worldwide community of developers gathers together to share, celebrate and do big things together.",1
"Though we could not be together in person, Apple set a new standard for what online events can achieve with our celebrated all virtual event. The results here speak for themselves. More than 22 million viewers tuned in across all of Apple streams. For our developers we distributed more than 72 hours of video content. That's three full days of video. The weak saw more than 200 direct video engineering and design sessions and about 4500 person to person appointments with developers across 227 virtual labs.",1
"And of course that's even before you get to this year's announcements from iOS 14, which boasts the radical redesign to the home screen, powerful updates to messages, streamlined and effortless app clips and even greater privacy transparency and controls to major updates to Apple Pencil, Siri and calling and iPad OS 14 to much anticipated sleep tracking, new fitness and wellness features and unprecedented customization and watchOS 7 to the new macOS Big Sur boasting the biggest redesign upgrade to macOS since OS X. No less important for Apple's innovation roadmap is our transition to Apple silicon for the Mac. This two-year effort will achieve both unprecedented performance for the Mac and a common architecture across all Apple products.",1
"Looking forward, we are profoundly optimistic about Apple's future and we recognize that with this success comes some real responsibility to lead with our values because those values help make that success possible in the first place. We are just as proud of our announcement this month that Apple will be fully carbon-neutral by 2030 across our entire supply chain and including the energy use of every device we make as we are of any hardware innovation because they spring from the same instinct to leave the world better than we found it. We're committed to standing with those marching for the lives and dignity through our new $100 million commitment to Apple's racial equity and justice initiative, and we're deepening our diversity and inclusion efforts internally because our future as a business is inextricably linked with the future of our communities.",1
"There are times when things seem to move slowly when needed progress, economic or social themes bogged down when the instinct to turn away from the horizon and hold onto what you've got fields and ex-capable, and then there are times like this when people of goodwill step forward, when progressed on Moore's itself, when the insistence of hope forces something new. This is an immensely challenging moment. COVID-19 is still devastating many places and we have work left to do to care for the health and well-being of the communities in which all of us live and work. But no community of people, whether a company or a country, can afford to miss this call when it comes. At Apple, we never have and we don't intend to start now.",1
"With that, I'll hand things off to Luca.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter was a testament to Apple's ability to innovate and execute during challenging times. Our results speak to the resilience of our business and the relevance of our products and services in our customers' lives.",1
"Total revenue was $59.7 billion, a new June quarter record, up 11% from a year ago, despite a 300 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Our performance was strong across our entire portfolio as we grew revenue in each of our product categories and set June quarter records for Mac, for Wearables and for services. Similarly, our results were very strong all around the world with growth in all geographic segments and new June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe, in Japan and Rest of Asia-Pacific. Products revenue was $46.5 billion, up 10% and a June quarter record. iPhone returned to growth and we saw very strong double-digit growth from iPad, Mac and Wearables. Lockdowns and point of sale closures were widespread during April and impacted our performance, but we saw demand for all products improve significantly in May and June.",1
"As a result of our strong performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories. Our services continue to grow strongly up 15% year-over-year and reached a June quarter record of $13.2 billion. We set all-time records in many services categories and June quarter records in each geographic segment. I'll cover this in more detail later.",1
Company gross margin was 38%. This was down 40 basis points sequentially due to unfavorable FX of 90 basis points and a different mix of products partially offset by cost savings and services mix. Products gross margin was 29.7% decreasing 60 basis points sequentially due to FX and a different mix partially offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 67.2% up 180 basis points sequentially mainly due to mix.,1
"Net income was $11.3 billion and earnings per share were $2.58, up 18% and a June quarter record. Operating cash flow was also a June quarter record at $16.3 billion, an improvement of $4.6 billion over a year ago. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.",1
"iPhone revenue grew 2% to $26.4 billion with customer demand improving as the quarter progressed. COVID-19 was most impactful during the first three weeks of April when lockdowns and point of sale closures became more widespread in many countries. We saw marked improvement around the world in May and June, which we attribute to an improved level of customer demand helped by the very successful launch of iPhone SE and economic stimulus packages. Our active installed base of iPhones again reached an all-time high as a result of the loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem. In fact in the US the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined.",1
"Second, we had strong performance in our digital services with all-time revenue records in the App Store, Apple Music, video and cloud services as well as elevated engagement on iMessage, Siri and FaceTime. Customers are loving new offerings across Apple services like Apple News today, our new daily audio briefing and Greyhound, our new summer blockbuster starring Tom Hanks. In fact, Apple TV+ just hit a history making 95 awards nominations and 25 wins and accolades. Based on these results and our performance over the last four quarters, we are proud to announce that we have achieved our goal of doubling. Our fiscal 2016 services revenue six months ahead of schedule. We're conscious of the fact that these results stand in stark relief during a time of real economic adversity for businesses large and small and certainly for families.",1
"These strong results helped drive our installed base of active devices to new all-time records across each of our product categories. Reflecting the deep integration of hardware, software and services, services generated a June quarter record of $13.2 billion, up 15% year-over-year. As we mentioned during our last call, there were two distinct trends we were seeing and they played out as we thought. First, results for advertising and AppleCare were impacted by the reduced level of economic activity and store closures to a degree that was in line with our expectations.",1
"We expected iPad and Mac growth to accelerate and we saw very strong double-digit growth for these devices this quarter. This remarkable performance came in spite of supply constraints on both products. We're working hard to get more iPads and Macs into customers' hands as quickly as possible recognizing how integral they have become to working and learning from home providing entertainment and staying connected with loved ones. Wearables growth decelerated as we expected, but still grew by strong double-digits and set a revenue record for a non-holiday quarter. Building on powerful new features built into watchOS 7 and AirPods Pro announced this quarter, we are very excited about the many opportunities in front of us for this product category.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Got it. If I can just follow-up on the China market, one of the things that we're looking at is going into the New Year into 2020 there'll be a lot of 5G phones launching in that market from the Android players. How do you think about the competitive landscape there as you enter next year?",1
"We don't comment on future products. With respect to 5G, I think most people would tell you, we're in sort of the extremely early innings of it. And even more so on a global basis. So, we couldn't be more proud of what our lineup is and we're excited about the great pipeline of both hardware and software and we wouldn't trade our position for anyone's.",1
"Thank you, Samik. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts as webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. And the numbers of the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820, please enter confirmation code 3057347. These replays will be available by approximately 5 Pm Pacific Time today.",1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414. And financial analysts can contact Tejas Gala or me with additional questions. Tejas is at 669-227-2402, and I'm at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
"Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.",1
"At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn things over to Mr. Tejas Gala, Senior Manager, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"iPhone revenue grew 2% this quarter. In April, we expected year-over-year performance to worsen, but we saw better-than-expected demand in May and June. We attribute this increase in demand to several interactive causes including a strong iPhone SE launch, continued economic stimulus, and potentially some benefit from shelter in place restrictions lifting around the world.",1
"Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Before we begin, I joined the many millions across this country in mourning and memorialize Congressman John Lewis, who was laid to rest earlier today. We've lost a hero who walked among us, a leader in the truest sense who urged this country to aim higher and be better until the very end.",1
"I was humbled and fortunate to know him and as an Alabama native his example inspires me still. It now falls to every American to be a living memorial to John Lewis and to carry forward the work and the mission that defined his life. Throughout the call I'll speak in greater detail about Apple's support for equity and justice topics of great urgency on a number of fronts, but first I want to pull the lens back to consider the quarter and full. In an uncertain environment Apple saw a quarter of historic results demonstrating the important role our products play in our customers' lives.",1
"We set a June quarter record with revenue of $59.7 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Both products and services set June quarter records and grew double-digits and revenue grew in each of our geographic segments, reflecting the broad base of this success.",1
"As always and especially in times of real adversity, what makes us proud as a company is not merely what we did, but how we did it. As millions March for justice in big cities and small towns alike, we committed a $100 million to launch Apple's racial equity and justice initiative as well as new and renewed internal efforts to foster diversity and inclusion at all levels of the company.",1
"As COVID-19 continues to represent great risks for individuals and great uncertainty for our communities, care and adaptability are defining how we conduct our work wherever we work. In some places that has met responsibly reopening our operations and retail stores with enhanced health and safety precautions. In others, where the virus has reemerge it's meant taking the challenging, but necessary step of re-closing stores.",1
"I'll touch on these topics more in a little bit. But first I want to offer some more context on the quarter's results. Due to the uncertain and ongoing impacts of COVID-19, we did not provide our typical guidance when we reported our results last quarter, but we did provide some color on how we expected the June quarter to play out. I'd like to contextualize our results in terms of that color across each of our product categories beginning with iPhone.",1
"Turning to services, as I said, we set a June quarter record of $13.4 billion of revenue. We had all-time record performance and strong double-digit growth in the App Store, Apple Music, video and cloud services. Our new services Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and Apple Card are also contributing to overall services growth and continue to add usersâ content and features. At the same time customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow at a fast pace. The number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the June quarter with paid accounts increasing double-digits in each of our geographic segments.",1
"In aggregate, paid subscriptions grew more than 35 million sequentially and we now have over 550 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 130 million from a year ago. With this momentum we remain confident to reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020.",1
"Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new June quarter record with revenue of $6.5 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 140 company and we set June quarter records in the majority of markets we track. Importantly Apple Watch continues to extend its reach with over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter new to the product.",1
"Yes, Tim, I was trying to see, four years ago you made a great prediction that services is going to be $50 billion by 2020. I wanted to see if you have any update to the prediction four years down the road?",1
"The iPhone SE, it's also clear that from the early data we're seeing a higher switcher number than we did in the previous year, which we feel very good about. And it also seems to appeal to some people that were holding onto the device a little longer because they wanted a smaller form factor phone. And so the combination of the smaller form factor and an incredibly affordable price made the iPhone SE very popular. iPhone 11 is still the most popular smartphone, but iPhone SE definitely helped our results. And as we -- as Lucas said in his outlook, we do see that continuing into this quarter currently.",1
Thank you. Congrats on the quarter.,1
Thank you so much.,1
"Yes, that would be from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.",1
"Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, Tim, when you look at the services business and in terms of your TV+ content production have the movement restrictions impacted the content production efforts? And along the same path four years ago your premonition on services being a $50 billion business in 2020 came sooner than expected, I don't know if you want to make any such forecast four years out and how you think services revenue is going to be. Then I have a follow-up for Luca.",1
"I'm sorry. I missed that second question because the audio didn't come through. But I think I got the gist of the first. And that is production has been affected for Apple TV+ as I think it has for most people. We are working to get restarted. I don't have a precise date yet when we will get it restarted, but there will be some impact because we shut down in the March time frame and are yet to really restart in a significant way particularly for those that are shut in the LA area given the current status of the virus and those. And I'm sorry I missed your, the second part of your question.",1
"We're not updating today. We feel good. We want to take the moment and feel good about achieving the doubling six months early. And we do have still hanging out there, as you know, the subscription number that we're shooting for later in the year at 600 million. So we do have that objective out there.",1
"And then, as a follow-up, just specifically to iPhone the category returned to growth. As you pointed out, the installed base is larger today. Our math would suggest that replacement cycles in some cases are elongated. And then you have the affordability element that you just discussed. Does all of that combine to build confidence that we're entering a longer period of iPhone revenue growth after what's been six quarters of decline?",1
"If I could just squeeze in one for Luca. With the strong sales in Mac given the shelter-in-place, do you think the back-to-school season got pulled in by a quarter or do you expect the momentum to still continue? Thank you very much.",1
"As I said, when I was talking about providing some commentary for the September quarter, we expect all the non-iPhone product categories to have a very strong year-over-year performance. So we definitely, I mean, the back-to-school season is clearly this one and we are very excited not only for the Mac, but also for the iPad. We've got a fantastic lineup of products and we know that these products are incredibly relevant especially given the current circumstances. So we expect the performance that we've seen for Mac in the June quarter to continue.",1
Yes. From Cross Research we'll hear from Shannon Cross.,1
"Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? I know the revenue was up 2% and I think Luca talked about record iPad, but just curious as to given their 5G [indiscernible] how you're seeing the market play out? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.",1
"Shannon, the growth that we -- we did see growth in Greater China for the quarter of 2%, currency affected China, a bit more than in other places, it affected 400 basis points. And so in constant currency, we would have grown at 6%. As I had mentioned before, the iPhone 11 has been our best-selling phone and has been number one in urban China and so we're very, very proud of that. iPad was helped in the June quarter there by the work from home and distance learning as it was in other geographies and the Mac also grew strong double digit during the quarter. And services set a new June quarter record there. We also continue to see extremely high new customer rates on Mac and iPad there, to give you a perspective, about three out of four customers that are buying the Mac are new in China and about two out of three that are buying the iPad are new. And so these are numbers that we're super proud of.",1
"Great. And then, can you talk a little bit more about the decision to bring Mac Silicon in-house, then the benefits that you expect to see or you've seen from vertical integration of acquisitions like the Intel modem business? Thanks.",1
"We're very pleased with how we did on iPhone. It was better than we thought largely because as we pointed out in the prepared remarks May and June were much better. If you look at iPhone in totality the things that get me very optimistic is the size of the active installed base. The fact that if you look in the major geographies like the US, we had the top two selling smartphones. In the UK we had three of the top four. In Australia, we had five of the top six. And in Japan we had the top four. Urban China we were, iPhone 11 was the top selling smartphone in the country. And so these are some very different geographies with their very different competitive situations and we're doing fairly well.",1
"Yes. As Luca mentioned, in June we actually rolled out to the overwhelming balance of our other products the ability to do interest rate, interest free financing in our stores with payments. And that's in addition to trade-in which is becoming a more common trend now which I think is terrific because it is great for the environment and it acts as a subsidy, if you will, against the price of the new phone. And so when you compound these two things with the financing and the trade-in it makes the product super affordable. And we're really happy with what we're seeing in that regard.",1
"Next, I'd like to talk about the impressive performance of Mac. Revenue was $7.1 billion, up 22% over last year and a June quarter record. We grew double digits in each geographic segment and set all-time revenue records in Japan and rest of Asia-Pacific as well as June quarter records in the Americas and Europe.",1
"And finally, we retired an additional 4.8 million shares in the final settlement of our 15th ASR. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"Customer response to our new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro launches has been extremely strong. iPad performance was equally impressive with revenue of $6.6 billion, up 31% and our highest June quarter revenue in eight years. Demand was strong around the world with double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments, including a June quarter record in Greater China.",1
The launch of our new iPad Pro has been received incredibly well in every region of the world. Both Mac and iPad are extremely relevant products in the new working and learning environments and the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 96% for Mac and 97% for iPad.,1
"Around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product. And as a result, the active installed base for both products reached a new all-time high. Our retail business had record June quarter revenue. Thanks to the performance of our online store which had records in all geographic segments and grew across all major product categories.",1
"In June, we launched Apple Card Monthly Installments for more products in our US stores allowing customers to pay for their devices all the time with 0% interest. We're very pleased with the level of customer interest this new offering has generated. In the enterprise market, we continue to see companies leverage Apple products and offerings to successfully navigate their businesses through COVID-19. In healthcare, we are seeing rapid acceleration of telehealth to support a more flexible model of patient care. Many hospitals such as UVA Health, Rush University Medical Center and UC San Diego Health are using apps on iPad and iPhone to have triage, monitor and care for patients who are at home. This helps free up hospital capacity to support patients who need inpatient care while enabling continued care for patients who do not require in-person visits.",1
"Since many call center employees are currently working remotely, Apple Business Chat has proven an invaluable tool for staying connected with customers. This quarter HSBC deployed Apple Business Chat in its US and UK contact centers. Apple Business Chat provides a flexible and secured channel for digital banking assistance through a native Apple experience improving the efficiency and experience for both customers and agents.",1
"We are seeing similar adoption by hundreds of other organizations. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $194 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $8.5 billion of new term debt, retired $7.4 billion of term debt and increased short-term borrowing facilities by $1.1 billion during the quarter leaving us with total debt of $113 billion. As a result, net cash was $81 billion at the end of the quarter and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the June quarter, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $10 billion through open market repurchases of 31.3 million Apple shares. We also began a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 15.2 million shares.",1
"Similar to last quarter, given the uncertainty around the world in the near-term, we will not be issuing revenue and margin guidance for the coming quarter. However, we will provide some additional insight on our expectations for the September quarter for our product categories.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon. Tim in light of the economic adversity that you talked about in the prepared remarks, can you just walk us through how Apple is leveraging finance and trade-in programs to make technology more affordable and accessible during this period, while also addressing the opportunity to recycle and reuse products and maybe also extend that to how these programs might expand over time and then I have a follow-up.",1
"On iPhone, we expect to see recent performance continue for our current product lineup, including the strong customer response for iPhone SE. In addition, as you know, last year we started selling new iPhones in late September. This year we project supply to be available a few weeks later. We expect the rest of our product categories to have strong year-over-year performance. For services, we expect the September quarter to have the same trends that we have observed during the June quarter except for AppleCare where during the September quarter a year ago we expanded our distribution significantly.",1
"As a consequence, we expect a difficult comp for AppleCare also considering the COVID related point of sale closures this year. For gross margin, keep in mind that we will have a different mix than in prior years as I just explained.",1
"For OpEx, we expect to be between $9.8 billion and $9.9 billion. We expect the tax rate to be about 16.5% and OI&E to be $50 million. Also today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.82 per share of common stock payable on August 13, 2020 to shareholders of record as of August 10, 2020.",1
"And finally, today we're announcing a four for one split of Apple common stock to make our stock more accessible to a broader base of investors. Each shareholder of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020 will receive three additional shares for every outstanding share held on the record date and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on August 31st, 2020.",1
"Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we please have the first question?",1
"Yes, that will be from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.",1
"Turning to services, as I mentioned, we reach an all-time revenue record of $17.5 billion with all-time records for cloud services, music, video, advertising and payment services, and June quarter records for the App Store and Apple Care. Our newest service offerings Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple card, Apple Fitness+ as well as the Apple One bundle, continue to scale across users, content and features and are contributing to overall services growth.",1
"The key drivers for our services business all continue to move in the right direction. First, our installed base of devices reached an all-time high across each geographic segment. Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the June quarter in each geographic segment, and paid accounts increased double digits.",1
"Third, paid subscriptions continue to show strong growth. We now have more than 700 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 150 million from last year, and nearly four times the number of paid subscriptions we had only four years ago.",1
"Fair enough. For my follow-up, Apple's probably one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. How does Apple determine what's strategic, and something that Apple wants to make itself versus non-strategic? And also was curious, there's a lot of -- well, it's public news now the Arm is getting acquired by Nvidia. And I was just curious how Apple views that? Is that something that's beneficial to Apple or not meaningful or negative?",1
"And more importantly, it's a great customer benefit because many of our customers like to try out more than one of these services, and it allows them to do that with one easy bundle and subscription service.",1
"In terms of IDFA or the advertising in general, I take it your question is around ATT. With ATT we've been getting quite a bit of customer positive reaction to being able to make the decision on a transparent basis about whether to be tracked or not. And it seems to be going very well from a user point of view.",1
"Thank you. Can we have a question, please?",1
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.,1
"Yes, thank you, I have two as well. To begin with Luca, you noted significant product revenue deleverage but yet your product gross margins were roughly flat, you know that cost savings. Can you maybe talk about whether these are tactical in nature, or more structural like vertical integration that will continue to drive benefits to product gross margins?",1
"And on services side, you noted several times about the strength in ad growth, which is obviously very high margin contributor, but the sequential trajectory on services margins was flat. So what were some of the offsets there? And Iâve a follow-up for Tim.",1
"Yeah. On the product side, I talked about cost savings. Tim mentioned that, maybe on the freight side, we're seeing some level of cost pressure that is a bit out of the norm, at this point in the cycle. For everything else, for all the major commodities and components, we continue to see a very typical cycle where we are getting good cost savings on a sequential basis. And so far, it's been very good as you can tell from the absolute level of gross margins, because on the product side, we're up more than 600 basis points on a year-over-year basis. So it feels something that we've been able to accomplish, and we were able to maintain, at least in the near-term, nothing that was abnormal during the quarter or a one-off in nature. It was pretty structural.",1
"On the services side, again, up a lot on a year-over-year basis. So, the baseline has gone up a lot. The sequential decline, as you said, it was very, very small. And as I mentioned several times in the past, we have a very large services portfolio with very different margin profiles in our services. And so even a slight change in mix can drive some sequential differences, and this was the case this quarter, just a different mix. I mentioned for example, that Apple Care has rebounded.",1
"And so the relative success of our services in the marketplace can drive some slight changes in gross margins. Again, step back for a second, 69.8% gross margin we're very, very happy with where we are with the services margin trajectory.",1
"Okay. Thanks, Luca. And Tim, there is increasing regulatory focus in China in particular on some of the Chinese companies. It's not a direct impact of Apple, but how should investors handicap the indirect impact, given some of these companies are pretty large contributors to Apple's App Store revenues? And also, is there -- are you seeing any impact at all from these? And is the limiting of the usage of some of these apps influencing how people are either interacting with your devices, or is there any other ancillary impact that you're seeing? Thank you.",1
"For the quarter, as you can see we grew 58% so it was a strong quarter. And embedded in that was a quarterly record for services, which includes the App Store world. So, we're seeing strength in China. The economy has really bounced back there fairly quickly from COVID.",1
"In terms of the regulatory focus, what we are focusing on from our angle is to serve users there and make sure that they're very satisfied with the products and services that weâre showing. And we work with a lot of different companies to ensure that. So that's our focus.",1
"Thank you, Wamsi. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. The numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. Please enter a confirmation code 9766068. These replays will be available by approximately 5 PM Pacific Time today.",1
Members of the press with additional questions can contact Josh Rosenstock at 408-862-1142. Financial Analysts can contact me with additional questions at 669-227-2402. Thank you again for joining us.,1
Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.,1
"In terms of Apple One as you know, we're offering Apple One because it makes enjoying our subscription services easier than ever before, including Apple Music and Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade and iCloud and more. And so we really put the customer at the center of that and have recently began to remind people about Apple One in a way that we probably waited a few months before doing that. And so, I'm very pleased with what we're seeing on Apple One right now. I think it's a great ramp for the future services.",1
"Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start Luca or Tim, could you walk us through a little bit about how you think Apple One bundles are influencing the trajectory of services and the economics? And then a second part on services, I'm curious how you think IDFA is developing and influencing the trajectory of the advertising business within services?",1
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research Company.,1
"As I said before, I think probably maybe with the basis of your question, sort of the latest nodes, which we use in several of our products have not been as much of an issue. The legacy nodes are where the supply constraints have been on the silicon.",1
"And so the M1 is a great example of that. We have the ability within our silicon team to deliver product that we feel is appreciably better than we could buy. And so, we've taken our great hardware and software expertise, and combine those and have brought the M1 out. And the response to the M1 has been unbelievable. It's powering Mac sales that are constrained, it's powering now iPad, which also has constraints on it. And so, that's how we look at whether we should enter into a market or not.",1
"Certainly, we will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.",1
"Hi, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong results. First one for Luca, you mentioned services growth should normalize in the September quarter. And I understand the last few quarters' services business was strong, driven by work from home, et cetera. So what is the normalized growth rate for the services business as folks return back to the office in this post-COVID world? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"Well, I think, you can go back several quarters and try to do a bit of an average and that's what we were talking about. Of course, there's always a bit of variability around results, right. But certainly, we haven't done 33% in years and so that was a bit of an anomaly. And again, I explained it's around a couple of the businesses that had a relatively easy compare during the June quarter. So our services growth has been for many, many quarters in strong double digits and we feel confident around that level.",1
"Got it. And then just a follow-up for Tim or Luca. I think, Tim, you mentioned in your prepared comments that in September quarter, there's going to be greater impact on supply constraints on the iPhone and iPad. So I'm kind of curious, this is the first time I heard you talk about component shortages impacting the iPhone. Can you be more specific? Is it display drivers? Or, what exactly is the choke point on the supply?",1
"The majority of constraints we're seeing are of the variety that I think others are saying that are I would classify as industry shortage. We do have some shortages, in addition to that, that are where the demand has been so great and so beyond our own expectation that it's difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times that we try to get those. So it's a little bit of that as well.",1
Thank you. Weâll hear the next question from David Vogt with UBS.,1
"In most of the markets I read, it is really, really, really early on 5G, really early. But I think the top end buyer is buying for the future as well, because they may hold their phone for two years or longer in some cases. So, 5G becomes an important part of their buying decision.",1
"Great. Thank you guys for the question. So maybe just a point of clarification. So based on the data and the comments about upgraders and switchers being strong, as well as emerging markets were relatively strong in the quarter. What does that specific set of data points strength mean for the iPhone portfolio?",1
"And I guess my question around that is, when you think about switchers and price points, I think last year, you launched the SE2 to really address maybe some of the lower price point markets like the emerging markets. So does that mean thinking about the portfolio going forward, there's less of a need for a lower priced product going forward, and the current portfolio and the new cycle going forward would be more high-end in nature, as we currently have today? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"David, we had an incredible quarter for the emerging markets in Q3. We set June quarter records in Mexico, and Brazil, and Chile, in Turkey, and UAE, and Poland and Czech Republic, India.",1
"Obviously, in China, as I've talked about before, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, I could go on in the name a few more, it's a very long list. And so those results are for the entire line of products that we have. And keep in mind, we still do have SE in the line, we launched it a year ago, but it's still in the line today. And itâs sort of our entry price point. And so, I'm pleased with how all of them are doing. And I think we need to sort of that range of price points to accommodate the types of people that we want to accommodate.",1
"So we've put something for the entry buyer who really wants to get into an iPhone, and then something for the pro buyer who wants the very best iPhone that they can buy. And I think that's true in the emerging markets as good as it's true in the United States or other developed markets.",1
"No, that's helpful. I appreciate that, Tim. So does that mean sort of the emerging market buyer that wants to get into the iPhone is looking for a device that has 5G capability as well? Obviously, we're early innings in a lot of markets, or how do we think about that over the intermediate to longer-term in terms of consumer preference for 5G in those markets, if available from an infrastructure perspective?",1
"Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q3 FY 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during the discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operation. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast.",1
"iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year due to supply constraints and negative foreign exchange. Customer response to our iPad lineup continue to be strong across consumer, education and enterprise markets around the world. And the iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of the customers during the quarter being new to the product.",1
"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report June quarter financial results that continue to demonstrate our ability to innovate across hardware, software and services while operating our business effectively during very challenging economic circumstances. We set a June quarter revenue record of $83 billion, up 2% year-over-year despite supply constraints, over 300 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of our business in Russia. Around the world, we set new June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific.",1
"On the product side, revenue was $63.4 billion with a June quarter revenue record for iPhone. During the quarter, our installed base of active devices continue to grow well, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments. Our Services set a June quarter revenue record of $19.6 billion, up 12% over a year ago, with all-time revenue records in the Americas and the rest of Asia Pacific and June quarter records in Europe and Greater China.",1
"We also achieved June quarter revenue records in each major Services category, including all-time revenue records for Music, Cloud Services, Apple Care and Payment Services. Company gross margin was 43.3%, down 40 basis points from last quarter as seasonal loss of leverage and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by favorable mix.",1
"Products gross margin was 34.5%, down 190 basis points sequentially, mainly driven by seasonal loss of leverage, mix and FX. Services gross margin was 71.5%, down 110 basis points sequentially due to a different mix and foreign exchange. Net income was $19.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.20, while operating cash flow of $22.9 billion was a June quarter record.",1
"Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 3% year-over-year to a June quarter record of $40.7 billion despite foreign exchange headwinds as customer response to our iPhone 13 family continue to be strong. We set June quarter records in both developed and emerging markets. And the iPhone active installed base reached a new all-time high across all geographies as a result of this level of sales performance combined with unmatched customer loyalty. In fact, the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%. We also attracted a record number of switchers for the June quarter, with strong double-digit year-over-year growth.",1
"For Mac, we generated revenue of $7.4 billion despite supply constraints and negative effects. We continue to be excited about our long-term opportunity with Mac and redefining the PC experience with our relentless innovation. Our investment focus on Mac has helped drive significant growth in our installed base, which reached an all-time high during the June quarter as nearly half of the customers purchasing a Mac were new to the product.",1
"Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 8% year-over-year as we faced foreign exchange headwinds, different launch timing for Home and Accessories products and supply constraints as well as the overall macroeconomic environment. Despite this, our installed base of devices in the category hit a new all-time record, thanks to very strong customer loyalty and high new tool rates. For example, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.",1
"And we're committed to doing our part to address the housing crisis across California. To date, we have deployed more than $1.3 billion to a number of initiatives, including ones that provide financial assistance to low and moderate income first-time home buyers develop new affordable housing and help support vulnerable populations.",1
"Services had a June quarter revenue record of $19.6 billion, up 12% despite almost 500 basis points of FX headwinds as well as impacts from our business in Russia and the macroeconomic environment. We set June quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets and set all-time records in many countries around the world, including the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Korea and India.",1
"The record level of performance of our Services portfolio during the June quarter reflects the strength of our ecosystem on many fronts: First, our installed base has continued to grow, reaching an all-time high across each geographic segment and major product category. We also saw increased customer engagement with our Services during the quarter. Our transacting accounts, paid accounts and accounts with paid subscriptions all grew double digits year-over-year.",1
"And paid subscriptions showed very strong growth. We now have more than 860 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 160 million during the last 12 months alone. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current Services offerings, from a constant flow of new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to great new features we recently announced for iCloud and Apple Music, which we believe our customers will love.",1
"In the enterprise market, our customers are increasingly investing in Apple products as a strategy to attract and retain talent. Bank of America is providing iPhones to all of its financial advisers so they can instantly access client information and provide timely wealth management advice from anywhere. Wipro, another large global enterprise customer, is investing in MacBook Air with M1 as a competitive advantage when recruiting new graduates globally, thanks to its superior performance and lower total cost of ownership. And with the new M2 chip powering MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro, we expect more customers to make Mac available to their entire workforce.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $179 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3 billion in maturing debt while increasing commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion. As a result, net cash was nearly $60 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned over $28 billion to shareholders during the June quarter. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $21.7 billion through open market repurchases of 143 million Apple shares. We continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.",1
"As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.",1
"This quarter has ultimately been a reflection of our resilience and our optimism. As we look forward, we're clear-eyed about the uncertainty in the macro environment. Yet we remain ever focused on the same vision that has guided us from the beginning. We strive every day to be a place where imagination ignites innovation like nowhere else, where good people come together to achieve great things, where customers are the center of everything we do. And we'll continue to execute on that vision as we always have, led by a focus on excellence and a desire to leave the world better than we found it. And with that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",1
"Leading with our values also means leading with a steadfast commitment to privacy and security. Last month, we announced the introduction of passkey, a next-generation credential that's intended to replace passwords. A passkey can't be phished nor can it be stolen by hackers in a data breach because the information is stored on your device and your device alone. And as part of our effort to combat targeted attacks against the highest risk targets like journalists and human rights activists, we introduced Lockdown Mode, which is designed to protect those most at risk of sophisticated digital attacks.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.",1
"In the Wearables, Home and Accessories category, the innovation infused across our products continues to win over new customers. Apple Watch remains a great way for health-conscious customers to track their overall wellness and fitness. And we're bringing them even more data about their workouts, sleep cycles and medications with updates soon to arrive on watchOS 9. We were also pleased to get FDA approval for a new feature that will let users with irregular heart rhythms track the time they spend in Afib.",1
"Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, Apple is reporting another record June quarter with revenue of $83 billion, which was better than we expected despite supply constraints, strong foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of our business in Russia. We set June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe and in the rest of Asia Pacific region. We also saw June quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets with very strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Indonesia and Vietnam and a near doubling of revenue in India.",1
"We saw great enthusiasm for our products and services, resulting in an all-time record for our installed base of active devices. Our supply constraints were less than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, coming in slightly below the range we discussed during our last call. We know that this is a time of significant challenge around the world for all of us confronting new variants of COVID-19, to those experiencing a prolonged humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and everyone dealing with the consequences of an uncertain economic environment. We know that much of the world is living through uneasy times, and it is all the more reason why we are working hard to help our customers navigate the world as it is while empowering them to create the world as it can be.",1
"Turning to iPhone. We set a June quarter record for both revenue and switchers to iPhone. With its advanced performance, capability and ease of use, customers continue to find that iPhone remains the gold standard for smartphones. And they've been raving about the iPhone 13 lineup's extraordinary camera quality with features like cinematic mode and macro photography to create eye-catching content. We were also proud to celebrate the 15th anniversary of iPhone, a device that continues to change the world in profound ways with each new innovation.",1
"Last month, Apple unleashed a wave of innovation, including the completely redesigned MacBook Air and a new 13-inch MacBook Pro. Both of these systems are powered by M2, our next generation of Apple silicon for Mac. M2 delivers a faster CPU, GPU and neural engine along with higher memory bandwidth and new capabilities like Pro Res acceleration. And it continues the tremendous pace of innovation in Apple silicon for the Mac. We continue to have supply constraints with Mac, but we're encouraged by the strong response from customers to our incredible lineup.",1
"iPad, like Mac, continued to see strong demand during the June quarter despite ongoing supply constraints. Customers and developers have been especially excited about the new features we're bringing to iPad with iPadOS 16. This update was one of the many announcements we made at a truly extraordinary WWDC, where we shared a range of new features that give customers more control of their experience than ever before. This includes the ability to edit or delete sent messages, a new way of organizing apps on iPad and Mac, and an all-new customizable lock screen on iPhone and so much more. Today, iOS 16, iPadOS 16, MacOS Ventura and watchOS 9 are all in public beta, and we couldn't be more excited to see what our community of developers creates with them.",1
"We unveiled new innovations and accessibility such as door detection and live captions that support users with disabilities with navigation, health, communication and more. We also announced Apple Pay Later, which gives customers more flexibility to make purchases with their Apple devices. And with our next generation of CarPlay, we're improving the driving experience with deeper integration into vehicle hardware, allowing drivers to control their music, change the temperature and monitor their fuel levels, all from a single integrated platform.",1
"Turning to Services. Customers continue to engage enthusiastically with our content across news, fitness, music, gaming and more. Services revenue rose to $19.6 billion, a June quarter record and a 12% increase year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. We're proud of how Apple TV+ productions like Severance and Black Bird have captured the popular imagination, and we're looking forward to more exceptional content developed by extraordinary creators throughout the year.",1
"And it includes our work to promote racial equity and justice. We recently announced that the Global Equity Innovation Hub, in partnership with Cal State Northridge, will provide new community grants to Hispanic-serving institutions to help the next generation of creators and innovators build skills and pursue high-demand careers in STEM. We also celebrated the graduation of the inaugural class of our Developer Academy in Detroit from a program designed to give students the skills they need to pursue jobs in the thriving iOS app economy.",1
"In 2.5 years since launch, Apple TV+ has now earned 250 wins and over 1,100 award nominations and counting. Just this month, we learned that Apple TV+ earned 52 Emmy Award nominations across 13 titles. In our last call, I mentioned Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV+, which is already delighting baseball fans. And last month, we announced a 10-year deal to present Major League soccer matches around the world, giving global soccer fans a whole new way of viewing their favorite sport.",1
"One of the best parts of WWDC was welcoming developers to Apple Park while continuing to connect with developers all over the world. This year, we had an incredible group of developers and more opportunities to learn from one another than ever before. It was a truly special experience and a reminder of the economic miracle the App Store represents.",1
"We are proud of the fact that the iOS app economy supports more than 2.2 million jobs here in the United States and many more around the world. It's been wonderful to see earnings by small developers more than double over the past 2 years. And as we're supporting developers, we're also doing our part to protect customers. In 2021, we prevented nearly $1.5 billion in fraudulent transactions by stopping over 1.6 million risky and vulnerable apps and app updates.",1
"Now I want to turn to retail. This quarter, we opened the doors to Apple's first store in the Hubei province in China, welcoming the community to a beautiful new space. And earlier today, we opened Apple Brompton Road, our fifth store in Central London. We also expanded today at Apple Creative Studios to reach even more young creatives from underrepresented communities to help them realize their potential and bring their best ideas to life.",1
"I'd like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to our team members working in Apple Stores, customer care centers and channel partner stores and to our Apple Care teams for their incredible work supporting customers wherever they are.",1
"Creating innovative products and services that enrich people's lives is our mission. Leading with our values and everything we do gives that mission purpose. That includes a commitment to the environment where we continue our aggressive pursuit of our 2030 goals. It includes our focus on diversity and inclusion, where we are committed as ever to making progress.",1
"I think that acquisition has lots of questions that people are asking, and I'll sort of leave that up to everyone else. And in terms of us and how we decide to make silicon, we ask ourselves, if we can do something better, if we can deliver a better product, if we can buy something in the market. And it's great, and it's as good as what we could do, we're going to buy it. We will only enter where we believe we have a ability to do something better, and therefore make a better product for the user.",1
"I would remind you that the billion number that I quoted also was iPhone, where we quoted a number earlier in the year in the January call, I believe, of 1.65 billion devices is the total active devices just for clarification. And so the net is very strong switchers, very strong upgraders, best upgrade quarter for the June quarter that we've seen. And we feel really great about the momentum. But at the same time, we recognize that the 5G penetration is quite low around the world. And, they're very, very low. We're at the front end of this.",1
"And finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love, while also continuing to improve the breadth and quality of our current services offerings. For example, during WWDC in June, we previewed our new iCloud+, and Apple Wallet features, which we believe will create a more secure and differentiated customer experience.",1
"Yeah, what I would tell you is first of all, it's difficult to answer your question precisely. But what I would tell you is on both switchers and upgraders, we did extremely well in Q3. Both were up strong double digit, and the geographic representation of iPhone year-over-year comps looks extremely well. And so we're really pleased with it.",1
"The first factor is that the dollar continues to be favorable on a year-over-year basis in the sense that it's weakened against most currencies on a year-over-year basis. But that benefit is going to be about three points less in the September quarter than what we've experienced during the June quarter, because the dollar strengthened against most currencies in recent weeks.",1
"Second, I mentioned that the services growth rate that we've experienced in the June quarter 33%, that's significantly higher than what we've had in recent history. And that was due to the fact that there were a couple of services categories, namely, our advertising business and Apple Care, that were significantly impacted a year ago, because of the COVID lock downs. And therefore, they're relatively easy compare in the June quarter. So we don't expect that to continue into the September quarter. And so we expect to see significant growth in services, but not to the level that we've seen in June.",1
"And then I mentioned that the supply constraints that we've seen in the June quarter will be higher during the September quarter. Back in when we talked here three months ago, we said that we were expecting supply constraints for the June quarter between $3 billion and $4 billion, to affect primarily iPad and Mac. We were able to mitigate some of those constraints during the June quarter, and so we came in at a number that was slightly below the low-end of that range that we accorded at the beginning of the quarter. But we expect that number to be higher for the September quarter.",1
"And so when you put all that together, again, very strong double digit growth for September, with this caveat, that I just mentioned.",1
"Thank you. If I could follow-up with regard to the supply constraints, and do you expect those supply constraints to persist through the December quarter as well? What effect will that have on the holiday selling season?",1
"And then, in conjunction with that, what additional costs are you absorbing because of the supply constraints? Is that having an effect on gross margins or just product costs in general, as you perhaps pay a little more to get more supply?",1
"Chris, it's Tim. In terms of the cost, we're paying more for freight than I would like to pay. But component costs continue in the aggregate to decline. In terms of supply constraints, and how long they will last, I don't want to predict that today. We're going to take it sort of one quarter at a time. And as you would guess we'll do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances were dealt.",1
"And Chris, on the cost side, as I mentioned during my comments, our results for gross margins for the June quarter 43.3%, we really saw some really nice cost savings during the quarter. And I think you've seen that we provided guidance for 41.5% to 42.5% for September, which is obviously a level that we are very pleased with.",1
Right. Thank you.,1
"Thank you, Chris. Can we have the next question please?",1
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment Research. Please go ahead.,1
"Thank you very much, and congratulations to you and your global team for great operations during a challenging time. Tim and Luca, I just have one question and either of you or both of you could figure out who's best to answer it.",1
"But we look at a world of pretty unprecedented whether it be COVID, the Delta variant, China floods, supply chain, components. Just wondering for your, like R&D and innovation, is it being materially impacted by that such where a normal cadence is unfair? Or, is it kind of happening during a slow time of year where you're able to empower people to work remotely, and still have the typical innovations and product launches that you've had historically in the past?",1
"Jim, the company has been incredibly resilient. The employees are really doing double duty. And I could not be more pleased with the cadence that we're coming out with new things. As you can see from the software announcements that we made at WWDC, and the corresponding launches of the software that we plan on in the fall, and then all of the products that we've been able to bring out over the last 12 to 18-months, it's amazing. So I'm very pleased with it.",1
"Thanks, Jim. Can we please the next question please?",1
"Well, as I explained that, first of all, we are expecting to grow very strong double digits, that's I think Chris the starting point here. We expect this very strong level of growth that we've experienced during the course of the year, to continue into the September quarter. We said that the growth rate is going to be below 36%. And I've listed three factors.",1
"Thank you. Good morning. Just dig into the commentary on guidance a little bit. Just starting with the fact that last year, obviously there was a later launch of iPhone than what was typically seen in other years. Could you talk us through that, and perhaps some of the other products, what may be different as compared to last year?",1
"Thank you. Our first question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy, your line is open. Please check your mute function. We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position, we ended the quarter with $194 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $3 billion of term debt and increased commercial paper by $3 billion, leaving us with total debt of $122 billion. As a result, net cash was $72 billion at the end of the quarter.",1
"Wearables, home and accessories grew 36% year-over-year to $8.8 billion, setting new June quarter revenue records in every geographic segment. We continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category. This quarter, we began shipping our new Apple TV 4K with a redesign Siri remote and our brand new air tags, and the customer response to both products has been very strong.",1
"In addition to its outstanding sales performance globally, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.",1
"For Mac, despite supply constraints, we set a June quarter record of $8.2 billion up 16% over last year, with June quarter revenue records in most markets we track around the world. It is remarkable that the last four quarters for Mac have been its best four quarters ever. This exceptional level of sales success has been driven by the very enthusiastic customer response to our new Macs, powered by the M1 chip, which we most recently brought to our newly redesigned iMac.",1
"iPad performance was also strong with revenue of $7.4 billion up 12% in spite of significant supply constraints. During the quarter we also started shipping our new iPad Pro powered by the M1 chip and customer response has been outstanding. Both iPad and Mac have taken computing to the next level, and when you combine their performance over the last 12-months, they're now the size of a Fortune-50 business, thanks to the best product lineups we've ever had, very high levels of customer satisfaction and a loyal growing installed base. In fact, around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product. And in most recent surveys of U.S. consumers from 451 research customer satisfaction was 92% for Mac and 95% for iPad.",1
"In enterprise, our customers are excited about the superior performance, battery life and security that the new M1 Macs bring. MassMutual for example, is offering M1 MacBook Pro to all of its employees and equipping all conference rooms with M1 Mac minis in preparation for return to work.",1
"And with its incredible performance and affordable entry price, the MacBook Air with M1 is gaining rapid adoption among many leading enterprise organizations. Italgas, Italy's largest natural gas company, which will soon be using its extensive network to distribute renewable gases is replacing every employee's Windows laptop with the new MacBook Air powered by Apple's M1 chip to bring the latest technology to its workforce. And Grab, Southeast Asia's leading super app that provides transportation, food delivery and digital payment services is adding M1 MacBook Air to its company-wide M1 Mac deployment.",1
"As our business continued to perform at a very high level, we were also able to return $29 billion to shareholders during the June quarter. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalence, and $17.5 billion through open market repurchases of 136 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 32 million shares.",1
"Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please.",1
"As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near-term, we're not providing revenue guidance. But we are sharing some directional insights, assuming that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter.",1
"We expect very strong double digit year-over-year revenue growth during the September quarter. We expect revenue growth to be lower than our June quarter year-over-year growth of 36% for three reasons. First, we expect the foreign exchange impact on our year-over-year growth rate to be three points less favorable than it was during the June quarter.",1
"Second, we expect our services growth rate to return to a more typical level. The growth rate during the June quarter benefited from a favorable compare, as certain services were significantly impacted by the COVID lockdowns a year ago.",1
"And third, we expect supply constraints during the September quarter to be greater than what we experienced during the June quarter. The constraints will primarily impact iPhone and iPad.",1
"We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect our OpEx to be between $11.3 billion and $11.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around zero, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.",1
"Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividends with $0.22 per share of common stock payable on August 12, 2021, to shareholders of record as of August 9, 2021.",1
Thank you. Congratulations again.,1
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"Thank you very much, Tim, I'm curious, what have you learned from this iPhone cycle regarding customer preferences and pricing and maybe subscriptions and that? And if there's a difference, if you could talk about on a geographic basis. Thanks.",1
"And just to follow-up on iPhones, specifically, if you look historically, after a really strong product cycle, which you've experienced this year with iPhone 12. iPhone revenues come under pressure, because the upgrade rate slows, the mix often shifts to the lower end of the portfolio. Is it fair to assume a similar trend will play out over the next year? Or if not, timeâ¦ [ph]",1
Thank you. Weâll hear next from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.,1
Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?,1
"Okay, good. So first question, there's a debate in the market around how much Apple benefited from the pandemic, given increased spend in areas like Mac and App Store. But of course, you've mentioned over the past several quarters that there are other areas that were limited by the pandemic, and store closures and less foot traffic. When you net out all the puts and takes was your business helped? Or, was it hindered by the pandemic?",1
"Well, of course, Katy, we don't have the crystal ball that tells us exactly what these different variables, how they impacted our business. We do know that I would say on the positive side of the ledger, obviously, especially during the periods of extreme lockdowns, digital services did very well because entertainment options were limited. And so obviously, our digital services did really, really well. Obviously with more people working from home, more people studying from home, we know that iPad and Mac demand was very, very strong.",1
"On the other side we add certain services like advertising because of the reduced economic activity, Apple Care because our stores were closed, they were affected negatively. And certain products like the iPhone or the Watch that are may be more complex types of sales because of the complexity of the transaction. They were also affected because so many points of sale were closed all around the world, not only our stores but also our partner stores. Itâs difficult for us to gauge because we've been constrained for quite a long period of time.",1
"And the reality is that maybe the new normal after we exit COVID may be different from the past. For example, maybe there's going to be hybrid models around work, for example. And so, it's difficult to tell you on a net basis what that is. Clearly, and this is very fluid because it tends to change over time. I can certainly tell you that we're all looking forward to a COVID free world, I think that would be very good for us and for our customers as well.",1
"Katy, it's Tim. We're not predicting the next cycle. But I would point out a few things. One is we have a very large and growing installed base. As you know with the iPhones passed a billion active devices earlier this year. Two, we have loyal and satisfied customers. The customer set we're seeing on the new iPhones are just amazing. It's just jaw dropping.",1
Perfect. Thank you.,1
"And the geographic response is pervasive across the world. In the U.S., we have the top three selling models. In the UK, we have four out of the top five. In Australia, we have the top two. In Japan, we have the top three. In urban China, we have the top two. And so the response from customers all around had been great.",1
"Obviously, the product itself is amazing. The 12 lineup was a huge leap that introduced 5G and have A14 Bionic and a number of other fantastic features that customers love. The next thing I think to consider is that we're in the very early innings of 5G. If you look at our 5G penetration around the world there's only a couple of countries that are in the double digits yet. And so that's an amazing thing, nine months or so into this.",1
"And the last thing is we're going to continue to deliver great products. We're going to continue to do what we do best is integrate hardware, software and services together into an amazing experience. And so those are the things that I would consider if I were coming up with forecast.",1
That's great color. Thank you.,1
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.,1
"Yeah. Hey, guys, first of all, congratulations, fantastic execution that resulted in consistency for your results. Tim, this is actually perfect timing for this question. You talked about your installed base of a billion odd units. I was curious if you could help us understand how all of that installed base is? And the reason that I'm asking this question is we're clearly seeing people upgrade to 5G phones. That's the case and that continues, that could be a larger force than most other forces for your revenues to continue to grow as people migrate to the 5G family of phones. So I was curious, if you can shed light on how the upgrades are happening and then also, how old that base is?",1
"Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"And of course, we continue to increase both the quality and the quantity of the services. As you know, during the last few years, we've launched a lot of new services from Apple TV+, Fitness+, Apple Arcade, News+, of course, the Apple Card. And so these are businesses that we are scaling right now, and so all that additional revenue helps. And I think it flows through our growth rates, as you said, during the last four quarters we are well into the mid-20s. So I think it's obviously very nice for us to see.",1
"If you look at our results in Q3, Shannon, we had strong double digit growth for switchers and for upgraders. And, in fact, it was our largest upgrade quarter for Q3 ever. And so we feel really, really great about both categories.",1
"And Shannon, for the world with the Watch is 75%.",1
"And as Luca kind of said, during the preamble or opening comments, our results are really strong for iPhone around the world. And so it's been a very, very strong cycle. And yet we're -- the penetration on 5G is obviously still very, very low. And so we feel really good about the future of the iPhone.",1
"Okay. And maybe if you can talk a bit about China, up 58%, where are you seeing the growth? What are you hearing from customers there? Obviously 58% is not sustainable, but how sustainable is the strength? Thank you.",1
"It was an incredibly strong quarter, it set a June quarter revenue record for Greater China for us. And so we're very proud of that. And, doing the best job we can to serve customers there. We had a particularly strong response to the 12 Pro and the 12 Pro Max. Those results were particularly strong. But if you look at the balance of our products, we also set June quarter records for Wearables, Home and Accessories, for Mac and for services. So it was sort of an across the board strength. And we're seeing plenty of new customers come to the market.",1
"For example, Mac and iPad, about two-thirds of the customers who bought in the last quarter were new to that product. For the Apple Watch that number was 85%. And so, we could not be happier with the results.",1
Was 85% China or overall?,1
85% was China. I was talking about specifically the numbers of reference were specifically for China.,1
Right. Great. Thank you so much.,1
"And second, we have more and more people that are engaged in our ecosystem, both transacting for free, which is a very large number, and people that are willing to pay for some of the services. And that percentage of people that are paying for our services continues to grow nicely. I mentioned, we grew double digits again this quarter. So that obviously helps on the revenue side.",1
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.,1
"Perfect. Thanks a lot for taking my question, I have two, as well. I guess first off Luca, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the gross margins and maybe the expectations you laid out for September, I think sequentially implies down 100 basis points or so. So can you just touch on what are the puts and takes that would be helpful, because I think historically, September tends to be a flattish maybe even up a little bit gross margin number for you folks?",1
"Yeah, I think it's important to go back to the Q3 results, it's 43.3%. And one of the things that I mentioned is that in addition to getting really good cost savings on a sequential basis, we also had a very high mix of services as part of the total. And particularly with advertising doing really, really well, because of the rebound that we saw from COVID lockdowns a year ago.",1
"So as we move forward sequentially, we do expect a different mix and so that that drives the guidance that we provided which again, as you know, is significantly higher than just a year ago, for example. A year ago, we were at 38.2%, so almost 400 basis points of expansion on a year-over-year basis. And so, I think it's important to take that into account, just a different mix.",1
"Got it. No, absolutely. I don't think anyone expected gross margins to be north of 40 this quickly for you folks. So that is impressive. As a follow-up on services, and I know you've called out the 33% growth this quarter, as a bit of an aberration that compares easier. But if you look at your services growth rate over the last four quarters, let's just say, what do you think is enabling this growth? Is it you're able to have a higher ARPU more monetization of the installed base? Or, is the installed base growing and choose which one's bigger? And then over time, how do you think those two components stack up for you?",1
"It's a combination of multiple factors. Obviously, the fact that our installed base continues to grow, and it sets new all-time highs all the time, obviously, it gives us a larger opportunity all the time.",1
"We're seeing good interest across virtually everything that we announced at WWDC. I couldn't be happier with it. The developer tools around ARKit and AR in general that I went through earlier, lots of interest there, lots of interest from the Watch App Store, to the Catalyst that will be released with macOS Catalina, which allows developers quickly to port a iOS app to the Mac. We think this is huge and so great for the user experience. And so, you look at all of these and all the things that I talked about earlier and I couldn't be happier with the reception that we're getting and the work that is going on behind the scenes right now for the developers readying their apps for the fall.",1
"Thank you, Jim. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"NPD indicates that iPad had 55% share of the U.S. tablet market in the month of June, including 8 of the 10 best-selling tablets. That's up from 46% share a year ago. And among tablets priced over $200, iPad's share was 89%. In addition, the most recent survey from 451 Research measured business and consumer satisfaction rates ranging from 95% to 99% across iPad models. And among those planning to buy tablets, purchase intent for iPad was over 70%.",1
"NPD indicates that iPad has 60% share of the U.S. tablet market in the June quarter, up from 51% share a year ago. And the most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 94%, and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPads.",1
"And tvOS will take the cinematic experience of Apple TV 4K to the next level this fall with support for Dolby Atmos audio and new features to easily find popular shows and movies. Apple TV 4K already offers customers the largest collection of 4K HDR movies and this fall, iTunes will be the home to the largest collection of Dolby Atmos-supported movies anywhere.",1
"I'm proud that our team's hard work has an impact even beyond these innovative industry-leading products and services. We're always working to leave the world better than we found it and as part of our commitment to address climate change and increase the use of renewable energy in our supply chain, we recently announced a first of its kind investment fund in China. Initially, 10 suppliers will join us in investing nearly $300 million over the next four years into the China Clean Energy Fund. The fund will invest in and develop clean energy projects totaling more than 1 gigawatt of renewable energy in China, the equivalent of powering nearly 1 million homes.",1
"We're seeing great momentum in our Everyone Can Code and Everyone Can Create initiatives. More than 5,000 schools and community colleges are now teaching Everyone Can Code and more than 350 schools have committed to incorporating Everyone Can Create into their curricula for the upcoming school year. Coding skills are opening doors for students and job seekers around the world as tremendous growth in the app economy creates opportunity everywhere we look.",1
We're also teaming up with leading educators for blind and deaf communities across the United States who will start teaching Everyone Can Code this Fall.,1
"Looking ahead, we couldn't be more excited about the products and services in our pipeline as well as limitless applications for augmented reality and machine learning technology. We're working with key partners in the enterprise to change the way work gets done with iOS and Mac. We're welcoming communities and offering learning opportunities at our retail locations through hundreds of thousands of Today at Apple sessions each quarter. We're expanding our reach into emerging markets and seeing strong double-digit growth in revenue and we're making great progress toward our goal of significantly expanding our services business.",1
"And now, for more details on the record June quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. We're very pleased to report the financial results of our best June quarter ever. As we have done in every quarter this fiscal year, we set new quarterly records for both revenue and earnings per share, with revenue up 17% year-over-year and EPS up 40%.",1
"Okay. And then my final question is just in terms of the growth question that some investors have about how you keep such a higher revenue growth number moving, last quarter you referred to new products emerging and this time you referred to more products over the next few years. Are there product categories out there that are big enough to move the needle for Apple?",1
"Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially, as cost improvements and foreign exchange offset the seasonal loss of leverage. Net income was $11.5 billion, up $2.8 billion or 32% over last year and it was also a new June quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $2.34, up 40% and also a new record for the June quarter and cash flow from operations was very strong at $14.5 billion.",1
"iPhone revenue grew 20% year-over-year with iPhone ASP increasing to $724 from $606 a year ago, driven by the strong performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus across the world.",1
"During the quarter, we sold 41.3 million iPhones, with double-digit unit growth in several markets including the U.S., Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico, Hong Kong, Russia, the Middle East and Africa. Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 3.5 million units during the quarter. We exited the June quarter towards the lower end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of iPhone channel inventory.",1
"Customer satisfaction with iPhone continues to be outstanding and is the highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates that across all iPhone models, customer satisfaction was 96% and combining iPhone 8, 8 Plus and iPhone X, it was even higher at 98%. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones, up 3 points from the last survey.",1
"Turning to services, we had our best results ever with all-time record revenue of $9.5 billion. Services revenue included a favorable $236 million one-time item in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits. Excluding this amount, services revenue was still an all-time record and the underlying growth rate of our services business was a terrific 28% over last year. We generated double-digit services growth in all our geographic segments and the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, cloud services and Apple Pay all set new June quarter records.",1
Our other product category also set a new record for the June quarter with revenue of over $3.7 billion. That's up 37% from last year with great sales momentum for both Apple Watch and AirPods. Apple Watch continues to be the best selling smartwatch by a wide margin and units and revenue grew dramatically during the quarter. AirPods continue to be a runaway success and we've been selling them as fast as we can make them since their launch a year and a half ago.,1
"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We were very happy to see double digit year-over-year growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all-time high with nearly 60% of purchases during the quarter coming from customers who are new to Mac. Our year-over-year sales performance was impacted by the different timing of the MacBook Pro launch which did not occur until early Q4 this year as opposed to June last year, with the subsequent channel fill during the June quarter. Even with a difficult launch comparison, we saw great momentum in many emerging markets, with growth well into double digits and we established new June quarter records for Mac sales in India, Turkey, Chile and Central and Eastern Europe.",1
"For Apple TV, we've seen major growth in sales since the introduction of Apple TV 4K last fall as video providers around the world choose Apple TV 4K to deliver their subscription services. Later this year, Charter Communications will begin offering Apple TV 4K to its customers in nearly 50 million U.S. households, providing access to live channels and tens of thousands of on-demand programs via the Spectrum TV app on Apple TV 4K, iPhone and iPad.",1
"As we announced at WWDC, beginning this fall, Safari will prevent share buttons and comment widgets on webpages from tracking users without their permission. Safari already protects personal data as users browse the web so they won't be re-targeted by ads. For Apple Watch, users will see a significant expansion of features and functionality in watchOS 5. Apple Watch will become an even stronger companion for fitness, communication and quick access to information with features including new workouts, activity sharing competitions, auto workout detection, advanced running features, walkie-talkie, podcast and third party apps on the Siri watch face.",1
We believe privacy is one of the most important issues of the 21st century and we're always working to make our products more private and more secure for our users.,1
"Apple Pay is now live in 24 markets worldwide with over 4,900 bank partners and we look forward to adding Germany later this year. We're excited to share that in the U.S., eBay is beginning to enable its sellers to accept Apple Pay and CVS Pharmacy and 7-Eleven will roll out Apple Pay acceptance in locations nationwide this fall. Transit is another important area of growth and Apple Pay can be used with iPhone and Apple Watch to quickly and conveniently ride public transit in 12 metropolitan areas. Apple Pay Cash, our peer-to-peer payment service, is already serving millions of customers across the U.S. less than eight months following its launch.",1
"Second, we had a stellar quarter in services which generated all-time record revenue of $9.5 billion fueled in part by double-digit growth in our overall active installed base. We feel great about the momentum of our services business and we're on target to reach our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020. Our record services results were driven by strong performance in a number of areas and I'd like to briefly mention just some of these.",1
"Paid subscriptions from Apple and third parties have now surpassed $300 million, an increase of more than 60% in the past year alone. Revenue from subscriptions accounts for a significant and increasing percentage of our overall services business. What's more, the number of apps offering subscriptions also continue to grow. There are almost 30,000 available in the App Store today.",1
"The App Store turned 10 years old this month and we set a new June quarter revenue record. The App Store has exceeded our wildest expectations, igniting a cultural and economic phenomenon that has changed how people work, learn and play. Customers around the world are visiting the App Store more often and downloading more apps than ever before. And based on third party research estimates, the App Store generated nearly twice the revenue of Google Play so far in 2018.",1
"The app economy is thriving and thanks to the App Store, it's generating jobs for tens of millions of people around the world. Our developers have earned over $100 billion from the App Store since its launch and we couldn't be more proud of them and what they've accomplished. We're hearing lots of developer excitement around our upcoming OS releases, which I'll talk about more in a moment, and can't wait to see what they can come up with next.",1
"We've experienced rapid growth in our App Store search ad service and as we announced earlier this month, we are expanding our geographic coverage to Japan, South Korea, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. We're also seeing strong growth in many of the other services as well. Just a few examples, Apple Music grew by over 50% on a year-over-year basis. AppleCare revenue grew at its highest rate in 18 quarters, partly due to our expanded distribution initiative. Cloud services revenue was also up over 50% year-over-year. Our communications services are experiencing record usage. We've hit all-time highs for both the number of monthly active users of Messages and the number of FaceTime calls made with growth accelerating from the March to June quarters.",1
"Siri requests have already exceeded 100 billion so far this fiscal year, and the number of articles read on Apple News more than doubled year-over-year. Apple Pay continues to expand with well over 1 billion transactions last quarter, triple the amount from just a year ago, with growth accelerating from the March quarter. To put that tremendous growth into perspective, this past quarter, we completed more total transactions than great companies like Square and more mobile transactions than PayPal.",1
"Our third highlight of the quarter is the outstanding results in wearables which comprises Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats and was up over 60% year-over-year with growth accelerating from the March quarter. Our wearables revenue exceeded $10 billion over the last four quarters, a truly remarkable accomplishment for a set of products that has only been in the market for a few years. Apple Watch delivered record June quarter performance with growth in the mid 40% range, and we're thrilled to see so many customers enjoying AirPods. It reminds me of the early days of iPod when I started noticing white earbuds everywhere I went.",1
"We've started with some of our own apps, so this fall, News, Stocks, Voice Memos and Home will be available on the Mac for the first time with macOS Mojave and we'll be bringing these great new tools to our developers next year. We believe this will dramatically broaden the ecosystem to benefit all Mac users, creating even more great reasons to choose Mac. Also this fall, the Mac App Store is getting a full redesign with rich editorial content to help customers discover great Mac apps from our developers.",1
"A number of other notable events in the quarter, we expanded distribution of HomePod to three additional markets and we added new immersive listening features with support for HomePod stereo pairs and a new multi-room audio system. In June, we hosted an extremely successful developers' conference that previewed many major advances coming this fall to our four operating systems, iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. Developer and customer reaction has been very positive and we have over 4 million users participating in our new OS beta programs.",1
"Starting with iOS 12, Siri will take a major step forward with Siri Shortcuts, which deliver a new, much faster way to get things done and allow any app to work with Siri. We believe this will make Siri even more useful and significantly expand its adoption. We've also designed performance improvements across iOS 12 to make everyday tasks faster and more responsive. Camera launches up to 70% faster. The keyboard appears up to 50% faster and apps can launch up to twice as fast.",1
"We've always been about empowering users to get the most from our product, but not about spending all of their time using them and so we're adding tools to iOS 12 to help our customers understand and take control of the time both they and their families spend interacting with their iOS devices. Activity reports will provide information on the amount and nature of time spent on iPhones and iPads and screen time will enable parents to monitor and limit their children's activity from their own iOS devices using Family Sharing in iCloud.",1
"Developers will be able to build even more intelligent apps with just a few lines of code using the power of machine learning with Core ML 2 and Create ML. We've also included our third release of ARKit in only one year. With ARKit 2, iOS 12 will provide an even more powerful platform to make dynamic AR apps, integrating shared and persistent AR experiences, object detection and image tracking. We believe AR can enable profound experiences and Apple is uniquely positioned to provide the best AR experience because of the seamless integration of our hardware and software.",1
The new capabilities of ARKit 2 will build on the potential of the thousands of AR apps already available in the App Store that are changing the way iPhone and iPad users see and experience the world.,1
"Turning to Mac, we want to empower our developers to bring their innovative apps from the iOS ecosystem to the Mac with minimal effort. Though iOS and macOS are different, they've shared common foundations from the very beginning, so we've taken key frameworks from iOS and adapted them to specific Mac behaviors like using a mouse or track pad, resizing windows, copy and paste and drag and drop.",1
iPad unit sales grew for the fifth consecutive quarter and we gained significant share of the global tablet market based on the latest estimates from IDC. We recorded double digit iPad unit growth in both our Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific segments with a new June quarter record for iPad sales in Mainland China. Almost half of iPad purchases in the quarter were by customers new to iPad and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high. Our overall performance compared to last year was impacted by the introduction of new iPad Pro models in June of last year which resulted in both a different mix with higher ASPs and channel sale a year ago.,1
"We continue to make great strides with enterprise customers across multiple industries. For example, financial services institutions are increasingly using iPads to deploy digital signature solutions for customer consent, compliance requirements, new account openings and services transactions. In the railway industry, businesses around the world are using iPhone and iPad to support operations, training, passenger engagement and maintenance activities. And leading global automotive companies are deploying iPads in dealerships for sales enablement and end-to-end customer service management and are choosing iPhone as the standard mobile device for their employees around the world.",1
"When you look in total, where we are in terms of our expense to revenue ratio for operating expenses, you know, quite well that we are extremely competitive relative to other tech companies. So, we want to continue to be competitive and at the same time we will not under-invest in the business.",1
"More and more companies are giving their teams a choice when it comes to the devices they use at work and enterprises including Salesforce and Capital One are deploying Macs based on employee preference. In fact, at Salesforce, the majority of their 35,000 employees are using Macs and companies tell us that Mac has been instrumental in helping them attract and retain talent while providing strong security, streamlined deployment, workflow and significantly lower total cost of ownership.",1
"Looking forward, you know we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter, but I think we have a pretty good record over the last several years to make good business decisions, balancing units, revenue and margins. As you know, foreign exchange has been a very significant headwind over the last three-plus years, but we've been able to manage that.",1
"On the memory front, it is true that prices have started to decline. It has been a significant headwind for the last 12, 18 months and still in the June quarter was a negative. We believe that we're going to start seeing some improvement from here on.",1
Thank you for that color.,1
Can we have the next question please? Can we have the next question please?,1
Certainly. Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"Thank you very much for taking my question. Tim, can you talk a bit about trends within your iPhone sales? ASPs were above expectations and now that you've had â and that's clearly better than some of the comments from some of your competitors. Now that you've had about nine months of experience with a high-end fully featured phone, can you talk a bit about what you think customers want, what the elasticity of demand is and how you're sort of thinking about your competitive position? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"Yeah, Shannon, we feel great about the results on iPhone, up 20%, and if you look for the cycle, by the cycle, I mean Q1, Q2 and Q3, we've had on an average weekly basis, growth in units of sort of mid single digit and ASP growth of double digit. And so if you, and look at iPhone X in particular, it's the most innovative smartphone on the market. We priced it at a level that represented the value of it and we could not be happier that it has been the top selling iPhone since the launch, and so we feel terrific about iPhone X.",1
"If you look at the sort of the top of our line together, and by that I mean the iPhone X, the 8 and the 8 Plus, they are growing very nicely, as you can probably tell from looking at the ASP and we couldn't be happier with how that's gone. And so I think in this cycle, we've learned that customers want innovative products and we sort of already knew that in other cycles and other points in times, but it just puts an exclamation point by that I believe with looking at the results.",1
"At the unit level, the iPhone SE had a difficult comp to the year-ago quarter and so, when we changed some of the configurations, memory configurations in the year-ago quarter. If you look at it on a geographic basis, the top three selling phones in urban China were iPhone, where iPhone X was number one and has been for a couple of quarters, and iPhones make up three of the top five smartphones in the U.S., UK and Japan. And so it's difficult sometimes to get a read over exactly what's happening in the market, but given the industry numbers that we've seen, it's clear that we picked up global market share and picked up market share in several countries, not only iPhone, but iPad as well.",1
"Great. Thank you. And then can you talk a bit about China, Greater China up 19% year-over-year during the quarter, I believe? Obviously iPhone doing well, but some concern that maybe some of what's going on in the trade world might have impacted. Doesn't seem like that, so I'm just curious as to what you're seeing in China and how you're thinking about it as you look forward. Thank you.",1
"Yeah, it's a good question. Thank you. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had double digit growth in Greater China. I mentioned how iPhone X and the iPhones are selling. We did pick up share in iPhone and iPad, but if you look more holistically at our complete line, we had double digit growth from services to iPad to iPhone and to our other product category which the watch did extremely well, and so there are lots of good things happening there.",1
"In terms of the tariffs themselves, maybe I could sort of take a step back because I'm sure some people have questions on this. And our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences.",1
"That said, the trade relationships and agreements that the U.S. has between the U.S. and other major economies are very complex and it's clear that several are in need of modernizing, but we think that in the vast majority of situations that tariffs are not the approach to doing that and so we're sort of encouraging dialogue and so forth.",1
In terms of the tariffs that have been imposed or have exited the comment period â I think there's one that's exiting today â there have been three of those and maybe I can walk through those briefly just to make sure everybody is on the same page.,1
"The first was the U.S. imposed a tariff on steel and aluminum. That was many, many different countries. That started I believe at the beginning of June. There have been two other tariffs that have totaled about $50 billion of goods from China that have either been implemented or exiting the comment period in this month. I think the latest one is today. If you look at those three tariffs, none of our products were directly affected by the tariffs.",1
"For September, we're also guiding about flat sequentially at the midpoint. As you know, we typically have what we call product transition costs during the September quarter, and this year we also have about 30 bps of headwind from foreign exchange again because the dollar has appreciated recently. We expect those two factors to be offset by positive leverage, because you've seen the revenue guidance that we provided and the mix to services that you've actually mentioned during your question. So we feel pretty good about also the guidance for the fourth quarter.",1
"During the quarter, we always have some loss of leverage because of our typical seasonality. This year we were able to offset that with some cost improvements and also we had some favorability in foreign exchange on a sequential basis. Unfortunately, as you know, the U.S. dollar has already appreciated again recently, so we do not expect to see that favorability to repeat during the September quarter. So those are the puts and takes for June and we're very happy to see gross margin sequentially flat for June.",1
"Katy, for margins, let me tell you about the puts and takes for the June quarter, then I'll talk about the guidance for Q4 and make some general observations for the future. Starting with the June quarter, typically we see a decline in gross margin going from the March quarter to the June quarter. Last year, we were down 40 bps. Two years ago we were down 140 bps. This year, we were able to keep GM flat sequentially.",1
"As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"We're also seeing great interest in Business Chat, our powerful new way for organizations to connect with customers. Business Chat lets customers get answers to questions, resolve issues and complete transactions directly from within Messages by starting a conversation on their iPhone or iPad and even continue the conversation on their Mac or Apple Watch.",1
"DISH Network is making Business Chat available to customers across the U.S. to enhance the customer service experience for pay TV. Customers can instantly reach a live agent with their questions, make account changes, schedule an appointment, or order a pay-per-view movie or sporting event, all without leaving the Messages conversation.",1
"And Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies, is testing Business Chat with Aramark to handle beverage holders during games. Fans simply use their iPhone camera to scan a QR code on the back of their seats taking them directly to a Business Chat conversation in Messages. From there, they can order drinks, pay quickly and securely with Apple Pay and have them delivered directly to their seats without missing a moment of on-field play.",1
"Our retail and online stores had a great quarter thanks to very strong growth from iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch and the expansion of HomePod to Canada, France and Germany. Our stores hosted more than 250,000 of our very successful Today at Apple sessions. We continue to add content across all Today at Apple topics including popular new sessions on music and photography. We opened our 50th retail store in Greater China during the quarter and we just opened a beautiful new store in Milan this month, bringing the number of stores located outside the U.S. to 46% of the total.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $243.7 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $6 billion of debt during the quarter, leaving us with $102.6 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $129.1 billion.",1
"As we explained in February, we plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. We returned almost $25 billion to investors during the quarter, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents. We repurchased $20 billion worth of Apple shares of which $10 billion related to the completion of our previous $210 billion buyback program and $10 billion to the beginning of the new $100 billion authorization we announced three months ago for a total of 112.8 million shares repurchased through open market transactions during the quarter.",1
"We expect revenue to be between $60 billion and $62 billion. As you will recall, our September quarter results last year included a one-time favorable adjustment of $640 million to our services revenue. Taking that adjustment into account, our revenue guidance implies year-over-year growth of about 16% to 19%. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $7.95 billion and $8.05 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 15% before discrete items.",1
"In terms of the next leg of this, given the momentum that we're seeing across the board, we feel great about our current services, but obviously we're also thrilled about our pipeline that have some new services in it as well. And so with the combination of these, we feel great about hitting our objectives and maybe even doing a little better.",1
"Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock payable on August 16, 2018 to shareholders of record as of August 13, 2018.",1
"Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Operator may we have the first question, please?",1
Thank you. Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I'll ask both my questions up front. First, for Tim. You're on track to hit your services revenue target even earlier than planned, so how are you thinking about the next legs of services growth as you move into the next three to five years?",1
"And then for you, Luca, NAND prices are falling this year. Services mix is rising. Those should both positively influence gross margins and yet we're seeing gross margin sort of hang out here at 38%. What are the offsetting headwinds and is it possible that we could see the tailwinds start to overpower those headwinds in the next couple of quarters and see gross margins drift higher? Thank you.",1
"Yeah, Katy, thanks for your question. This is Tim. On the services side, we're thrilled with the results. They were very broad based. We had double digit services growth in all of the geographic segments and the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, cloud services, Apple Pay all set new June quarter records and of course subscriptions have now passed the 300 million, as I'd mentioned before, and so we couldn't be happier with how things are going.",1
"First, iPhone had a very strong quarter. Revenue was up 20% year-over-year and our active installed base grew by double-digits, driven by switchers, first time smartphone buyers and our existing customers whose loyalty we greatly appreciate. iPhone X was the most popular iPhone in the quarter once again, with a customer satisfaction score of 98% according to 451 Research. Based on the latest data from IDC, iPhone grew faster than the global smartphone market, gaining share in many markets including the U.S., Greater China, Canada, Germany, Australia, Russia, Mexico and the Middle East and Africa.",1
"Our team generated record Q3 earnings per share of $2.34, an increase of 40% over last year. We're extremely proud of these results and I'd like to share some highlights with you.",1
"Thank you, Nancy, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Today we're proud to report our best June quarter revenue and earnings ever thanks to the strong performance of iPhone, services and wearables. We generated $53.3 billion in revenue, a new Q3 record. That's an increase of 17% over last year's result, making it our seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and our strongest rate of growth in the past 11 quarters.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently-filed periodic reports on form 10-K and form 10-Q and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective date.",1
"Hong Kong continued to drag down the total Greater China segment. But on a sequential basis, we're probably at the trough of that, which is nice. With the peg to the dollar there from a currency point of view and tourism being what it is, I don't really know when that market will come back. But what we see on the mainland is definitely much more encouraging. It's interesting to note that upgraders both for the quarter and actually for the full fiscal year to-date was our highest ever, and so that we felt very good about.",1
"In terms of WeChat, the way that I look at this is because our share â because iOS share is not nearly a majority of the market in China, the fact that a lot of people use that, it makes the switching opportunity even greater. And I think that's more the case than the risk that a lot of folks have pointed out. And so I see Tencent as one of our biggest and best developers. They've done a great job of implementing a lot of iOS features in their apps and we're looking forward to working with them even more to build even greater experiences for our mutual users in China.",1
"Great. Thank you. And then can you talk a bit about the composition of the installed base of iPhones at this point, as obviously we're getting close to a refresh? Just you brought in the iPhone SE. You've obviously had strength at the high end. I'm just trying to think about what percent do you think have upgraded in the prior generation, any color you can give us on that?",1
"From an absolute quantity point of view, the upgrades for this fiscal year are the highest that we've seen. And so we feel good about that. However, if you look at it from an upgrade rate point of view instead of the absolute number, the rate is similar to what we saw with the previous iPhones, except for iPhone 6, which as we called out in the past had an abnormally high upgrade rate. We do think that based on the amount of rumors and the volume of them that there is some pause in our current numbers. And so where that affects us in the short-term, even though we had great results, it probably bodes well later on.",1
Thank you. I wonder if you wanted to make any comments about switching this quarter.,1
"Sure. Switching outside of China was up year-on-year, and so we're happy with that. We continue to see people moving over to iOS and it helped with us making the results that Luca announced earlier, including the channel inventory reduction.",1
"Okay, and then a government question. First of all, the President suggested that you may build three big beautiful plants. I wonder if you can comment on if that's a possibility either directly or indirectly. And then in China, I think, we all understand that you have to work within the regulations, but maybe you could comment a bit on how you feel your working relationship is with the government and if there is certain lines that you can't cross.",1
"Sure. Starting with the U.S., let me just take this question from what are we doing to increase jobs, which I think is probably where it's rooted. We've created 2 million jobs in the U.S., and we're incredibly proud of that. We do view that we have a responsibility in the U.S. to increase economic activity, including increasing jobs, because Apple could have only been created here. And so as we look at that 2 million, there are three main categories of that, and we have actions going on in each of them to further build on that momentum.",1
"The first category is app development. About three-quarters of the 2 million are app developers. And we're doing an enormous amount of things to deliver curriculum to both K-12 with Swift Playgrounds in the K-to-6 area, other curriculum as you proceed beyond grade 6 under the Everyone Can Code area. And just a couple months ago, we announced a new curriculum that's focused on community schools and community colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges, for kids that did not have coding in their elementary and high school years. And so we're excited about that because we think it could increase the diversity of the developer community and the quantity. And I think this area in general and all the things we do for the developer community will be the largest contribution that Apple can make because this is the fastest growing job segment in the country, and I think will be for quite some time.",1
"If you look at the second area, we have purchased â or we purchased last year about $50 billion worth of goods and services from U.S.-based suppliers. Some significant portion of those are manufacturing-related, and so we've asked ourselves what can we do to increase this. And you may have seen that at the beginning of the quarter, sometime in April I believe, we announced a fund, an Advanced Manufacturing Fund, that we're initially placing $1 billion in. And we've already deployed $200 million of that. And the first recipient is Corning in Kentucky, and they'll be using that money to expand the plant to make very innovative glass. And we purchase that glass and essentially export it to the world with iPhones and iPads.",1
"We think there's more of these that we can do. I think there are probably several plants that can benefit from having some investment to grow or expand or even maybe set up shop in the U.S. for the first time, so we're very excited about that.",1
"And then the third area is we have about two-thirds or so of our total employee base is in the U.S. despite only a third of our revenues being here, and we'll have some things that we'll say about that later in the year. And so that's what we're doing from a job growth point of view, and we're very, very proud of that.",1
"Now turning to China, let me comment on what I assumed is at the root of your question about this VPN issue. Let me just address that head on. The central government in China back in 2015 started tightening the regulations associated with VPN apps, and we have a number of those on our store. Essentially, as a requirement for someone to operate a VPN, they have to have a license from the government there. Earlier this year, they began a renewed effort to enforce that policy, and we were required by the government to remove some of the VPN apps from the App Store that don't meet these new regulations. We understand that those same requirements are on other app stores, and as we checked through that, that is the case.",1
"Today there are actually still hundreds of VPN apps on the App Store, including hundreds by developers that are outside China, and so there continues to be VPN apps available. We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries, we follow the law wherever we do business. And we strongly believe that participating in markets and bringing benefits to customers is in the best interest of the folks there and in other countries as well. And so we believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree.",1
"And in this particular case, now back to commenting on this one, we're hopeful that over time the restrictions that we're seeing are loosened because innovation really requires freedom to collaborate and communicate, and I know that that is a major focus there. And so that's what we're seeing from that point of view.",1
"Yeah. Thanks, Shannon. We were very encouraged by the results this quarter. We improved as we thought we would from the previous quarters a little more than I thought we would. If you look underneath the numbers, mainland China was actually flat year-over-year during Q3. And in constant currency terms, we were actually up 6% in mainland China. And so we're very encouraged about that. iPad grew dramatically more than the market. The Mac grew much more than the market. iPhone was relatively flat year-on-year, similar as the market was. And so we see all of those as very encouraging signs. On top of that, Services grew extremely strongly during the quarter.",1
"Thank you very much for taking my question. Tim, could you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? I think obviously, there continues to be strong demand for smartphones. But perhaps mix shift, I think you brought back the iPhone 6 this quarter to be a bit more price aggressive. And then can you just talk a bit about how you see that market developing with the growth of WeChat and some of the other developments that are happening there? Thank you.",1
"Katy, as Luca mentioned, we did assume some transitional costs in our guidance for the quarter, as is typically the case. And we're looking very much forward to the product rollouts.",1
"It was a very busy quarter for our retail and online stores, which collectively welcomed over 300 million visitors. In addition to our spectacular new store at the Dubai Mall, we opened our first stores in Singapore and in Taiwan during the quarter, expanding our total store footprint to 497 stores. In May, we kicked off Today at Apple, with new in-store programming from music to photography to art and coding. And our stores collectively hosted 87,000 sessions during the quarter. As Tim mentioned last quarter, we have entered a new chapter in retail with unique and rewarding experiences for our customers and some stunning new stores coming in the near future.",1
"Our enterprise business continues to expand, and our customers are transforming the way work gets done with iOS and iPad. Walmart will be deploying more than 19,000 iPads for employee training across 50 states, with projections of over 225,000 associates trained on iPad by the end of the year. Initial response from businesses to iOS 11 and the new iPad Pro has been amazing. And companies including Bank of America, Medtronic, and Panera tell us that they will be rolling out the 10.5-inch iPad Pro throughout key areas of their organizations.",1
"We're also seeing real traction with our enterprise partners. Just last month, we unveiled the next set of technology announcements in our partnership with Cisco. This new wave adds a whole new category of security features designed to help enterprises and employees defend against growing cyber threats. We believe this investment in our joint security solutions for iOS will make cyber insurance even more attainable for businesses.",1
"SAP is making great strides since launching the SAP cloud platform SDK for iOS in March, with a pipeline of hundreds of global opportunities. SAP has also released SuccessFactors Mobile, its first native iOS app for human resources, which will support 47 million iPhone and iPad users worldwide across multiple industries.",1
"And our partnership with Deloitte has recently expanded to several more European countries. We're helping clients transform their businesses with iOS. We jointly developed programs such as the Connected Store, a pop-up version of a retail environment, demonstrating iOS tools for sales and demand generation, as well as tailored apps for safe associates, store management, and customers.",1
"We also had a tremendous quarter for iPad in education, up 32% year over year. Following the launch of our new iPad in March, an update to our popular Classroom app, and continued enhancements to iOS that make managing iPads in the classroom even easier. The St. Paul Public School District in Minnesota is renewing its One to One program by deploying over 40,000 iPads across every student and teacher in the district. iPad was chosen because of its power and durability, ease of use, multimedia and accessibility features, and the extensive catalog of iOS apps designed specifically for education.",1
"The Shawnee Mission School District outside Kansas City recently purchased 19,000 iPads, extending its One to One program started in 2014 thanks to iPad's intuitive interface, superior reliability, and expansive ecosystem of iOS tools for education.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $261.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $4.7 billion. $246 billion of this cash, 94% of the total, was outside the United States. We retired $3.5 billion of debt and issued the equivalent of $10.8 billion in new euro and U.S. dollar-denominated debt during the quarter, including our second green bond, bringing us to $96.4 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding.",1
"Thank you, and maybe a question for both Tim and Luca. As you outlined on this call and at the Developer Conference in June, there is an unprecedented number of products that either ramped volume or launched in the back half of this year. So appreciating you only formally guide a quarter out, I wonder if there's any qualitative commentary you can provide to help us think about the back half of this calendar year and how all those new products that come into the model could impact either revenue seasonality versus past years or could impact just the costs associated with ramping that many products all at once. Thanks.",1
"We also returned $11.7 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $4.5 billion on repurchases of 30.4 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We launched a new $3 billion ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 15.6 million shares, and we retired 3.4 million shares upon the completion of our 10th ASR during the quarter. We have now completed $222.9 billion of our $300 billion capital return program, including $158.5 billion in share repurchases.",1
"As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $49 billion and $52 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.7 billion and $6.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $500 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable on August 17, 2017 to shareholders of record as of August 14, 2017.",1
And that question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Luca, first question for you, gross margin guidance is strong, but it did tick down from your June quarter guidance, and you also narrowed the range to 50 basis points. I wonder if you can just address. What is the driver of the sequential downtick, and what gives you confidence that you have more visibility than you did three months ago?",1
"Katy, sequentially from 38.5% that we just reported, typically we have product transition costs during the September quarter. That's the primary driver. This happens fairly regularly for us. We also have a more difficult memory pricing environment this year than a year ago. And we think that we're going to be able to partially offset this with the positive leverage. As you've seen, we guided up sequentially in revenue. So those are the major puts and takes.",1
"In terms of the range that we use for gross margins, we have a fairly good understanding on where we are with our hedging program, and that allows us to mitigate some of the volatility there. So we felt we could guide to a slightly narrower range, which we've done occasionally in the past.",1
"Some folks have tried to link it to the U.S. situation last year, and they're very different. In the case of the U.S., the law in the U.S. supported us, which was very clear. In the case of China, the law is also very clear there. And like we would if the U.S. changed the law here, we'd have to abide by them in both cases, that doesn't mean that we don't state our point of view in the appropriate way. We always do that. And so hopefully that's a little bit probably more than you wanted to know, but I wanted to tell you.",1
"Thank you, a question for Tim maybe on the iPhone install base. At various points in the past you've told us the rate at which that was growing. At the end of the first half, what is that up year on year? At what rate is it growing? Can you give us some sense of that?",1
"And on upgrade rates over the longer term, there are lots of moving parts, and I get that there's I guess geographic mix shift of your base. There's many new phones that you may or may not bring out. There's how carriers promote your products. But do you think this upgrade rate is sustainable? Do you think it gets faster all the time? How should we think about the major drivers that you want to see for it? Many thanks.",1
"And my second question is just about India, general thoughts about India in the quarter. Thank you.",1
"In terms of ARPU, maybe I can make a comment on ARPU specifically related to the App Store. What we're seeing and we've seen over a long period of time as we keep track of these cohorts of customers, we see that as customers get on the App Store and start spending on it, we see the spending profile is very similar across generations of customers. People tend to spend more over time. Obviously, you have different spending profiles in different geographies around the world, but in general you see that trend across the board.",1
"Got it, that's really helpful. And if I could just follow up, on the iPhone side, there's been a large amount of discussion in blogs and among your component suppliers that the timing this time may be somewhat different and delayed versus past. Your guide almost seems you're more excited about this iPhone launch versus historically because the sequential growth is better. So I guess beyond the fact we probably shouldn't read every blog and believe every blog, what do you think is different with this product launch or product availability through the cycle versus what you've seen historically?",1
We have no comment on anything that's unannounced.,1
"Fair enough, I figured it was worth a shot. Thank you.",1
That will come from Brian White with Drexel.,1
"Yes. Tim, growth in the smartphone market is now crawling along at about a low single digit percentage. I know iPhone grew about 2% year over year this quarter, and it looks like you had about a mid-teens market share in units in 2016. So as we look forward maybe three to four years, do you think Apple can expand its unit market share? And if so, what will be the drivers be?",1
"The answer to your first question is yes. I do think that we can grow both in units and market share. We don't predict those things, but yes, if you ask me what I think, that's what I think.",1
"It is happening for a variety of reasons. One of them, for example, is the fact that we are making it easier for customers to pay on the App Store. Outside the United States, in many markets, not every form of payment is accepted. We are making it easier all the time. We launched on Alipay, for example, in China during the December quarter. That has obviously helped a lot with the growth in the number of paid accounts. And we continue to bring more and more forms of payment in the App Store around the world. That's a big reason for that.",1
"And so what are the drivers? The installed base is growing. It's still growing very strongly. That will generate more upgrades over time. I feel good about our ability to convince people to switch. And where the developed markets the first-time buyer rates are down other than places like Japan perhaps, the emerging markets, we haven't even gotten started yet, really. From a revenue point of view, we had very strong growth there. Emerging markets ex-China were up 18% year on year. It was a record for us, so we see a lot of opportunity in these markets.",1
"We are investing in India. As you mentioned in your second point, we've already launched an app accelerator center. That's on top of working with the channel and looking at expanding our go-to-market in general. And we began to produce the iPhone SE there during the quarter, and we're really happy with how that's going. And so we're bringing all of our energies to bear there. I see a lot of similarities to where China was several years ago. And so I'm very, very bullish and very, very optimistic about India.",1
"Thanks very much, Brian. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone. And the numbers to the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. Please enter confirmation code 6376964. And these replays will be available by approximately 5:00 PM Pacific Time today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristen Huguet at 408-974-2414. And financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570 and I'm at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
"Good day and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I'd like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.",1
Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that we'll open the call to questions from analysts.,1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, share repurchases, dividends and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.",1
"The other reason why the number of paying accounts is growing is the fact that the quality and the quantity of content continues to improve. And so there's many more ways of experiencing games and entertainment and other apps on the store. We have other businesses like the Apple Music streaming service, which is growing very fast because we just started it a couple of years ago, so we are getting a lot of new subscribers there. Our iCloud storage business continues to grow very, very fast. So it's multiple services. The number of people transacting on our stores continues to grow.",1
"Amit, Luca. Our Services business is very broad. We've got multiple categories in the Services business, so it's difficult to talk about ARPU in general. It doesn't make a lot of sense. The reason for the acceleration also here is multiple factors. One that is very, very important for us is the fact that the App Store, which is the largest of our Services categories, is seeing an increasingly larger amount of paying accounts. On a year-over-year basis, the number of accounts that are actually transacting and paying on the App Store is growing very, very well.",1
"I think the upgrade rate is a function of many, many different things, from the size of the installed base, the age of the installed base, the product that is new at the time, the regional distribution, the upgrade plans that are in various markets around the world. And so I think there are many, many factors in that. It's not a simple thing that you can apply a set formula to or one variable or a couple of variable formula in my opinion. But I think in general, because our installed base was up strong double digit once again, there's a lot of factors that are very positive for us. And between the upgraders and the switchers that we see, and the first-time buyer category is still out there too in several countries, including some that you may not think there is, there's still a sizable base in some. Between those three areas, I think we have a lot of opportunity.",1
And then recently you talked about how Apple is focusing on autonomous systems for automobiles. And there has been press reports that Apple has been testing autonomous vehicles for potentially up to a year. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Apple's interest in autonomous vehicles and whether self-driving is really likely to be Apple's principal focus in the near to medium-term.,1
"Thank you, Kulbinder. Could we have the next question, please?",1
Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.,1
"Yes, thank you. I have one for Luca and one for Tim, please. Luca, typically in the fiscal Q4, Apple builds considerable iPhone channel inventory, like 2 million or 3 million units. You're starting from a very low point at the end of fiscal Q3, as you mentioned on the call, with the drawdown. As we think about what's embedded in your guidance for fiscal Q4 for channel inventory for iPhone, should we be expecting a normal seasonal build, or is it likely to be significantly higher given the very low starting point?",1
"As you know, Toni, we do not guide on channel inventory. We've never done that. We are providing a fairly wide range from a revenue standpoint, so obviously that also has an impact on potential channel inventory levels.",1
"One thing that I would tell you is that we feel very good about the performance of the business right now. We think that our Services business will continue to grow well. We've got a lot of momentum on iPad and Mac because we refreshed the lineups of those products. Watch and AirPods are doing incredibly well. We're getting a lot of positive customer feedback. And I think in general, even the performance in China, Tim has mentioned it. We think that the performance will continue to improve. So those are the drivers of our guidance range for the quarter.",1
"Okay, thanks. Tim, I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about two things that you mentioned in public before. One is television, which you have described as an area of intense interest, but I don't even think there was an update on Apple TV on this call. So perhaps you can talk to us about how you're thinking about content. I know you're doing some original content creation, and how that area is evolving in your thinking.",1
"On the first part of your question about original content, we have done some original content. It's focused on Apple Music. Currently, we have some more that's launching in a week or so that will be made available on Apple Music. The objective of this is really twofold. One is for our own learning, given that we're new in the video space in terms of creation. And two is to give the Apple Music subscriber some exclusive content and hopefully grow our subscriber base. And we've recently hired two great folks with lots of experience in creating content like Breaking Bad and The Crown and some really top-notch content. And so we'll see how this area goes, but it is still an area of great interest.",1
"Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess to start off with, on your Services segment, revenues actually I think accelerated by 400 basis points to worse than what you guys had in the first half of this year. Could you just help us understand what's driving this? Is there a way to think about ARPU in a traditional manner within that Services business versus the installed base growing?",1
"In terms of autonomous systems, what we've said is that we are very focused on autonomous systems from a core technology point of view. We do have a large project going and are making a big investment in this. From our point of view, autonomy is the mother of all AI projects. And the autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways and a vehicle is only one. But there are many different areas of it and I don't want to go any further with that. But thank you for the question.",1
That comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.,1
"Good afternoon. I just have one question for Tim. This may be a hard question to answer in a condensed way, but how would you describe what you expect the most near-term applications will be for developers to target using ARKit? Will it be consumer iPhone and iPad applications, enterprise applications, or I guess some combination of the two? And basically, how does this come to market in the most significant way in the next few quarters as Apple becomes the largest global platform for AR as you've talked about? Thanks.",1
"Mike, that is a great question. And I could not be more excited about AR and what we're seeing with ARKit in the early going. And to answer your question about what category it starts in, just take a look at what's already on the web in terms of what people are doing and it is all over the place. From entertainment to gaming, I've seen what I would call more small business solutions. I've seen consumer solutions. I've seen enterprise solutions. I think AR is big and profound and this is one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it.",1
"So I think that customers are going to see it in a variety of ways. Enterprise takes a little longer sometimes to get going. But I can already tell you there's lots of excitement in there. And I think we'll start to see some applications there as well. And it feels great to get this thing going at a level that can get all of the developers behind it, so I couldn't be more excited about it.",1
We'll go to Amit Daryanani.,1
"There is a fourth tariff which includes goods valued at $200 billion, also focused on goods that are imported from China. That one is out for public comment. Probably like everyone else, we're evaluating that one and we'll be sharing our views of it with the administration and so forth before the comment period for that one ends.",1
"It's actually a tedious process in going through it because you not only have to analyze the revenue products, which are a bit more straightforward to analyze, but you also have to analyze the purchases that you're making through other companies that are not related to revenue. Maybe they're related to data centers and this sort of thing and so we're going through that now and we'll be sharing our results later on those and feeding back public comment.",1
"Of course the risk associated with more of a macroeconomic issue such as an economic slowdown in one or more countries or currency fluctuations that are related to tariffs is very difficult to quantify. And so that, and we're not even trying to quantify that, to be clear about it.",1
"Until then, thanks for joining us today. And for more details on the June quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.",1
"In retail banking, two-thirds of top banks are deploying iPad for branch transformation and modernizing legacy interfaces with a unified iPad experience. One of the world's largest banks created an iPad suite that reduced customer on-boarding time from more than an hour to just 12 minutes. Bank branch employees are also using Apple Watch for communication and notifications and Apple TV for customer presentations from iPads using AirPlay.",1
"Financial institutions also tell us that they receive positive feedback from leveraging Apple solutions for direct customer engagement. American Express, Credit Suisse, Discover and T.D. Ameritrade have launched Apple Business Chat as a dynamic way to support and interact with customers.",1
"The intuitive interface of messages on iOS enables rich communication between customers and contact center staff. T.D. Ameritrade has also become the first brokerage in the world to enable immediate funding of accounts using Apple Pay, eliminating the 2 to 3 business days it used to take to fund accounts by wire transfer.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $211 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $3 billion of term debt and reduced commercial paper by $2 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $102 billion at the end of the quarter and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the quarter, including $17 billion through open-market repurchases of almost 88 million Apple shares and $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents.",1
"As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"We expect revenue to be between $61 million and $64 billion. This guidance includes almost $1 billion of year-over-year negative impact from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OINE to be about 200 million and we expect our tax rate to be about 16.5%. Also, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2019 to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2019.",1
"Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please.",1
The first question will come from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.,1
"Thanks a lot. Thanks for taking my question guys. I guess, two from me. First off, could you just talk about, when I think about the September quarter guide, it's implied I think up 16% or so sequentially. Historically, at least, in that guide has been in the 10% low double-digit kind of range. Just can you help us understand, what gives you the confidence for a better than seasonal guide in September, either from a geo or product basis would be helpful.",1
"Amit, it's Luca. Of course, this is our best estimate of where we think we will land. Clearly, we expect to have continued strong growth from the non-iPhone categories. We have great momentum in wearables. We mentioned that we were up almost 50% in the June quarter, or actually over 50% in the June quarter. Our services business, we set an all-time record in June. And so, these two categories have become really important and really large for us. And so, as we continue to grow, quickly that is going to help us as we go through the year. Keep in mind that the guidance includes an estimated almost $1 billion of foreign exchange headwind for the quarter.",1
"Fair enough. That's really helpful. And I guess if I just follow-up on China, impressed to see the continued recovery you guys are seeing that despite all the headlines that are out there. Just curious, what are the few things that are driving the success in China, and how sustainable do you think those changes are for Apple as you go forward.",1
"Yes, Amit, Hi. It's Tim, and I apologize for my voice, I'm suffering from an allergy. But what happened last quarter in China was a confluence of things. The government stimulus, this came in terms of a VAT reduction, a very bold one. We took some pricing action, we instituted our trade-in and financing programs in our retail stores and worked with certain channel partners on that as well. And we're seeing a growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem during the quarter. And so, when you look at it, each of our categories, iPhone, iPad, Mac, wearables, services, everything improved sequentially. So, we couldn't be happier with the progress. I would point out, I think I mentioned in my comments, that we actually grew in constant currency for Greater China and we grew in Mainland China on a reported basis. So, there's several things going on there that are quite positive.",1
"Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question please.",1
"Thank you very much. Can you talk a bit about what's going on within services, some of the puts and takes? Luca, you gave us some color in terms of the growth rates in that, but I'm just curious and I know you won't talk about future products, but as you think about the opportunity, you think about what you've got now and in the future and then some of whatâs been going on with China and that, is this something that could reaccelerate, or again, the 18% on a constant currency basis is obviously quite strong. But, how are you thinking about it?",1
"Yes. I think it's important to start with that 18% in constant currencies, Shannon. Our reported results are on a normalized basis, removing the one-time item from last year, was 15%. Clearly FX, plays a role around the world, 300 basis points of FX impact during the June quarter. In spite of that, it was an all-time record revenue. Our installed base continues to grow. It's growing in every geography and it's growing across all our major product categories, and that is very, very important for the services business.",1
"In the financial services industry, 90 of the largest 100 banks by assets size are deploying Apple products to improve efficiency and effectiveness across their organizations. iPhone and iPad are overwhelmingly the preferred mobile devices for bankers on the go. For example, 60% of the biggest banks are supporting iPads for wealth managers.",1
"In the enterprise market, we are gaining traction with our strategy of transforming major industries by expanding our leading positions in key functional areas to grow our reach and modernize customer and employee experiences.",1
"Our retail and online stores produce their best June quarter revenue ever, with double-digit revenue growth across Apple Watch, iPad, Mac and accessories. Our trade-in program is showing great momentum, with more than 5x the number of iPhones traded in compared to a year ago. We opened stunning new stores in the Carnegie Library in Washington D.C. and the busy Shinji District in Taipei as well as a beautiful new location in the Dallas Galleria. We ended the quarter with 506 physical stores in 22 countries alongside our online store presence in 35 countries.",1
"Turning to services, we reached an all-time revenue record in spite of foreign exchange headwinds with double-digit growth from the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services, and AppleCare, and triple digit growth from Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business. All geographic segments had double-digit growth in services revenue and set new June quarter records with all-time records in the Americas and Rest of Asia Pacific.",1
"Overall, products revenue was $42.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year, which is significantly better than the 8% decline in products revenue that we experienced during the first half of the fiscal year.",1
"Product categories outside of iPhone grew 20%, with strong results in Wearables, Mac and iPad. Services revenue grew 13% to a new all-time record of $11.5 billion. Excluding the one-time item, we highlighted a year ago in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits, services revenue growth was 15% and 18% in constant currency terms.",1
"On a geographic basis, we saw marked improvement in our year-over-year comparisons from emerging markets relative to the first half of this fiscal year, particularly in the BRIC countries, where year-over-year performance went from a 25% revenue decline in the first half to 3% growth in the June quarter.",1
"We set June quarter revenue records in several major developed markets, including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Australia and Korea. In emerging markets, we returned to growth in Mainland China, grew strong double digits in India and Brazil and we set new Q3 records in Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.",1
"Company gross margin was 37.6%, flat sequentially and in line with our guidance. Products gross margin was 30.4% down about 80 basis points sequentially due to seasonal loss of leverage and product mix partially offset by favorable cost. Services gross margin was 64.1%, up 30 basis points sequentially, primarily due to a favorable mix. Net income was $10 billion, diluted earnings per share were $2.18 and operating cash flow was $11,600,000,000.",1
"Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $26 billion, down 12% compared to a year ago. This was significantly better year-over-year performance than last quarter's 17% decline, with sequential improvement in year-over-year comparisons in 15 of our top 20 markets. Our active installed base of iPhone continued to grow to a new all time high in each of our geographic segments and in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research, indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone 10R, iPhone 10S and 10S Max combined. Among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 83% plan to purchase iPhones.",1
"In total, services accounted for 21% of Apple revenue and 36% of gross margin dollars.",1
"Wearables, home and accessories revenue accelerated across all our geographic segments, growing 48% to over $5.5 billion and setting a June quarter record. This growth was fueled primarily by the strong performance of our wearables business, which was up well over 50% and has become the size of a Fortune 200 company over the last 12 months. In addition, we generated double-digit revenue growth from Apple TV and accessories during the quarter.",1
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all time high in the June quarter and the number of paid accounts grew strong double digits compared to last year. We now have over 420 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platforms and we are well on our way to our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark during 2020.,1
"On the App Store, our growth accelerated sequentially. Our subscription business continues to grow strongly and is extremely diversified across many categories such as entertainment, lifestyle, photo and video and music. Third-party subscription revenue grew by over 40% and across all third-party subscription apps, the largest accounted for only 0.25% of total services revenue.",1
"Among our many services records, it was our best quarter ever for AppleCare. We are seeing an increase in service contract attach rates and are expanding distribution of AppleCare through our partners. We also recently expanded our authorized service provider network and nearly 1000 Best Buy stores across the U.S. are now offering expert service and repairs for Apple products. This expansion provides customers with an even more convenient access to repairs using parts certified for safety, quality and reliability. In addition to Apple retail stores there are over 1800 third-party Apple authorized service providers in the U.S., which is 3x as many locations as three years ago.",1
"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $5.8 billion, up 11% compared to last year. Mac revenue grew in 4 of our 5 geographic segments and set June quarter records in the U.S., Europe and Japan, as our overall market performance significantly outpaced the global PC industry. Nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, with revenue growing in both developed and emerging markets and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all time high.",1
"We also had great results for iPad, with $5 billion in revenue, up 8%. iPad revenue grew in all 5 of our geographic segments, with a Q3 revenue record in Mainland China and double-digit growth in emerging markets. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the June quarter were new to iPad and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all time high.",1
"The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 94% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPads.",1
"I would say, I'll give you a bit more color around two offsetting factors around this performance during the June quarter. On one side, the App Store, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth accelerated sequentially. We had double-digit growth on the App Store in every geography. In China, we saw significant acceleration. As you know, we tend to monetize in China on the App Store through game titles and the government has approved a few key game titles during the quarter. That has helped our performance there.",1
"On the other side, AppleCare, I mentioned AppleCare was an all-time record in June, so really strong performance, but our growth has decelerated in AppleCare due to factors that we fully expected, because we are comping this expansion of our coverage for AppleCare that we've had significant success during the last 18 to 24 months in really broadening our coverage of AppleCare around the world with some key partners, carriers and resellers. And obviously, as we go through the year those comps become a bit more difficult.",1
"Having said all that, that we've given ourselves a couple of targets and we feel very confident about reaching those targets. The first one is that, we wanted to double the size of the services business from our fiscal 2016 to 2020. We are on our way there. Paid subscriptions is another target, is important to us. It's an important way for us to monetize our ecosystem. We set a target of surpassing 0.5 billion paid subscriptions on the ecosystem during 2020. Weâre already at 420 million now. So, we feel confident there.",1
"Yes, Wamsi, as you know we're not getting into this topic very much. But, I think I can give you some color here. You know that in general, we decrease our inventory during the March quarter and the June quarter. That has been traditionally what we've done. This year, we reduced channel inventory for iPhone slightly more than last year and that is true in total and it's true for Greater China as well. So, we feel very good about our channel inventory ranges as we get into the September quarter. Hope that helps you with that.",1
"Thank you, Krish. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"Next, we will go to Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.",1
"Yes. Thank you. Tim, the China trade situation remains sort of fluid over here and more recently you asked for some tariff exceptions were not granted those. How are you thinking about the longer-term footprint for manufacturing and can you talk about any potential alternatives that you've looked at and considered in moving parts of production potentially out of China. And I have a follow-up.",1
"Yes. I know there's been a lot of speculation around the topic of different moves and so forth. I wouldn't put a lot of stock into those, if I were you. The way I view this is, the vast majority of our products are kind of made everywhere. There's a significant level of content from the United States and a lot from Japan to Korea to China and the European Union also contributes a fair amount. And so, that's the nature of a global supply chain. Largely, I think that will carry the day in the future as well.",1
"In terms of the exclusions, we've been making the Mac Pro in the U.S., we want to continue doing that. And so, we're working and investing currently in capacity to do so, because we want to continue to be here. And so that's what's behind the exclusions. And so, we're explaining that and hope for a positive outcome.",1
"Okay. Thanks, Tim. And there is, Luca, maybe for you, there's been some significant destocking of inventory in the first calendar half of this year in iPhone. Can you comment about the broader channel inventory levels where you are in your typical ranges, especially given the comment around June iPhone sales being quite strong and do you expect anything atypical in channel inventory dynamics in the September quarter? Thank you.",1
Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.,1
"We're also continuing to focus on the enterprise market. Luca mentioned some of this in his comments and we think that continues to be a big opportunity for us. And then, we've got lots of what I would call core technology kinds of things like augmented reality, where we're placing big bets and bet that we have a big future, in addition to the health kinds of things that may fall out of the watch. And so hopefully that kind of gives you a view over the total.",1
"Thanks very much. The first question is probably to Tim and second one for Luca. I will ask them at the same time, so you can continue which other one you want to answer, first or second. While the first one is for Tim, regarding the installed base comment you've made, which is quite encouraging, but yet when you look at the iPhone revenue year-over-year the past several quarters have been down. Can you help us bridge the gap of, how is the installed base growing? Is it mostly because secondary users are the new ones coming into the system as people are holding more phones longer? And what does that user typically bring in with them or something unique relative to what we historically know?",1
"And then for Luca, you've been investing a lot, a lot, lot and a lot of these services are now coming to pass whether it be AppleCare, Apple Cloud, all these wearables and soon Apple Pay and Arcade. Are we at a point where now a lot of harvesting is going to happen or do you kind of continue this relatively same investment that you've been doing for the future strategy. Thank you.",1
"Hey, Jim, it's Tim, I'll start with your installed base question. Installed base is a function of upgrades and the time between those. It's a function of the number of switchers coming into the to the iOS, macOS and so forth [indiscernible]. It's a function of the robustness of the secondary market, which we think overwhelmingly hits an incremental customer. And it's a function still in the emerging markets and somewhat developed markets to a lesser degree of people knew that theyâre buying their first smartphone. There are still quite a few people in the world in that category. And so, the reason that the installed base doesn't correlate to the 90-day clock is that what's happening underneath the numbers is, switchers are still a very key piece of what's going on. The secondary market is very key, and we're doing programs et cetera to try to increase that, because we think we wind up hitting a cost number that we don't hit in another way.",1
"And the upgrades where people are holding onto their device a bit longer than they were, they're staying in the ecosystem. And then, you have the people in the new category as well. And so, that's sort of the equation. I don't want to go into the specific numbers, but I think you can see readily, mathematically, how the installed base is growing in an environment where the iPhone revenue is declining within a 90-day kind of window.",1
"And Jim, on OpEx, obviously is very important for us to continue to invest in the business, particularly on the R&D side, because we will always want to bring more innovation into the market. We want to improve the user experience and differentiate our products and services in the marketplace. So, we will continue to do that. There are some types of investments, of course, that are very strategic for us and they will have long-term implications. You've seen the announcement that we made around the Intel acquisition. Very important strategically for us. It requires upfront investment, of course.",1
"As you've seen from this quarter and also from the past, we will continue to run our SG&A portion of OpEx tightly. Of course, we'll continue to invest in marketing and advertising. We talked about a lot of new services that we are launching during the fall and Apple Card next month, obviously they will require the appropriate level of marketing and advertising as we launch them to the general public.",1
"And so, we're focusing on products and services and there will be some services that aren't hooked and some that are hooked not on current period sales mostly, very much services are rarely connected on that today or at least not a high percentage by any means there. They're more correlated to the active installed base and also the level of transacting customers that are there and the amount per customer, which relates also to the offering that we have.",1
"At the same time, on the market side, we have emerging markets where we have low penetration. And during the quarter tactically the emerging markets had a bit of a rebound. And in fact, on a constant currency basis, we actually grew slightly in emerging markets. We still declined on a reported basis. India bounced back. During the quarter, we returned to growth there. We're very happy with that. We grew in Brazil as well.",1
"And of course, as you mentioned, we're very excited about the fact that we're going to be launching new services soon. As Tim said, we're starting the rollout of Apple Card in August, and there's two more very important services that weâre going to be adding to our portfolio during the fall. One is Apple Arcade, which is our gaming subscription service, and then of course Apple TV+, which is our video streaming service. So obviously these services will help us carry on with the momentum that we had in services.",1
"And then just on the App Store, appreciate there's not a lot of detail out around exact timing and even some pricing of the new services, but how should we think about the new services that launched in March impacting the overall services growth. Does that start to benefit the model in the back half of this calendar year, or will the impact be more longer term in nature and really show up in 2020?",1
"Great. Thank you. And this is probably for you too as well, Luca. Can you talk about gross margin? The guidance was pretty solid. Obviously, there are various things that are at play here. I know you mentioned $1 billion worth of top-line impact, I think from, currency last quarter. Then maybe if you can kind of talk about what went into your gross margin guidance.",1
"Yes. So of course, Shannon, as you've seen, our guidance for margin is 50 basis points higher than the guidance that we had given for June. I would say on the positive, we expect to benefit from leverage. As you've seen from our revenue guidance, and from cost savings, because as you know the commodity environment is fairly favorable right now. On the negative side, the headwind on gross margins on a year-over-year basis from foreign exchange is about 100 basis points. And so, we need to keep that in mind. But we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided.",1
Thanks Shannon. Could we have the next question please.,1
Our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Yes. Thank you. I'd like to go back to the discussion around strength in China in the quarter and understand what linearity looked like. I ask because there was some industry data around the smartphone market in China that seemed to deteriorate in the month of June, the App Store data deteriorated a little bit in June, and just curious if thatâs something you saw in the business and if it at all informs your outlook around the pace of the China business as you go into September.",1
"Katy, it's Tim. We obviously took into account all of the information that we had and coming out with the guidance including linearity across last quarter and how this quarter has started. And so, we obviously look at that in quite much detail.",1
"Katy, let me just talk about the new services that we've announced in March, and then also about the timing of how we get to revenue, right? We've announced Apple News+, and this is the service that is available for consumers right now. We've announced our channel service, which has also become available a few weeks ago. The other three services, the card is launching in August, the gaming service and the video service are starting in the fall. Keep in mind for all these services, there's a trial period up front, there's going to be different trial periods, we'll see what that what they look like. So, the road to monetization takes some time. Obviously, all of them will add to our base and will help us with growth rates as we get into next year.",1
And we've got the Wearables area that is doing extremely well. We stuck with that when others perhaps didn't and really put a lot of energy into this and a lot of R&D and are in a very good position today to keep playing out what's next there.,1
The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.,1
"Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, on the iPhone trade-in program, how effective was it and what percentage of the iPhone sales came from the trade-ins and are there any other geographies where you are left to rule it out? Then, I have a follow-up.",1
"Hi, it's Tim. In retail, it was quite successful. We got going in a larger way during that quarter, we were pretty much just ramping in the previous quarter. And trade-in as a percentage of their total sales is significant and financing is a key element of it. Those two things in the aggregate led the combination of retail and online, just short form that is retail Apple Store let to growth in June trajectory. We are obviously taking those programs and advocating those more widely and that is at different levels of implementation throughout different geographies. Because we're working with our carrier partners on those and retail partners.",1
"Got it. Got it. That's pretty helpful, Tim. And then, a follow-up for you, a much longer-term question. I understand we're in the very early innings of the services growth story. Is there a way to think about it down the road, 3 or 5 years down the road, would the services growth still be tethered to the hardware of the iPhone, or do you think at some point down the road services would be independent by itself and not really tied to your hardware installed base?",1
"Well, there are elements today that are not necessarily tethered to iPhone, right? We have other products where people are both purchasing things, they're watching Apple TV. We offer Apple Music on Android, and so there's a series of things that are outside of that. And so we'll see what we do in the future. I don't want to really get into that.",1
"But, more broadly, to answer your question about growth as we go forward, the way I see it is, we have the strongest hardware portfolio ever, we've got new products on the way, the pipeline is full of great new stuff both on the product and the services side. We're very fortunate and work very hard to have loyal customers and to continue attracting an impressive number of switchers. The installed base is growing, hit a new record, that's obviously good. And it hit a new record across all geographies and across all categories. And so, this is a really good thing.",1
"We're happy to report a June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year. We return to growth in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment around the world, which impacted our year-over-year growth rate by 300 basis points. We set June quarter revenue records in the Americas, in Japan and the rest of Asia Pacific and as Tim mentioned earlier all our geographic segments grew in constant currency.",1
"On so many fronts there's an enormous amount to look forward to over the next few months, including the launch of new services like Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, and Apple Card. And without giving too much away, we have several new products that we can't wait to share with you.",1
"All of this said, we're optimistic, as I've been the whole time, that this will get sorted out because there is an inescapable mutuality between the U.S. and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together, that each country can only prosper if the other does and of course the world needs both U.S. and China to prosper for the world to do well. That said, I can't predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this and we are hoping that calm heads prevail.",1
RealityKit is a new developer framework built from the ground up to provide all the tools and technologies required to make AR objects virtually lifelike. And Reality Composer brings AR content creation to tens of millions of developers who have no 3D experience. Our developers are already running with these new technologies and we think our customers are going to love some of the apps that these creators have in store in the months ahead.,1
"In terms of batteries, we have never done an analysis internally about how many people decided to get a lower-priced battery than buy another phone because it was never about that for us. It was always about doing something great for the user and I think if you treat the users and the customers well, then you have a good business over time and so that's how we'd look at that.",1
"Thank you, Toni.",1
Next we'll take a question from Laura Martin from Needham.,1
"Yeah, can you hear me okay?",1
"Great. Okay. Super. So I'd like to focus on product roadmap and strategy. There is a war going on for the home, the connected home, over the Internet of Things. And with two products, the HomePod and Apple TV in the home, my question is strategically, how do you feel about the importance of being in the home and whether it threatens your dominance outside the home with your core business in the mobile devices if you sort of lose that battle? I'm just trying to figure out strategically when you think about where the puck is going, how important is it for you to have a beachhead in the home as well as out of home?",1
"I think the home business, Laura, is bigger than the HomePod and Apple TV. They're both important products clearly, but everybody has their iPhone at home as well and everybody has their Mac at home and everyone has their iPad at home. And so in terms of the Siri access point, as you can tell from the 100 billion number I quoted in the script, there's an extraordinary amount of usage of these products that are used to perform home-related functions.",1
"I do that every day with controlling all my home automation and so on and so forth. Part of that is on HomePod but part of it is with the Apple Watch and the iPhone and the iPad, and so I think home is important. Home is important. Work is important. The movement between the two are important. Health is important. So the smartphone has become the repository that goes across the whole of your life, not something that is just meant for a portion of it and so I think all of those are important and we're focused on all of them.",1
"Okay. That's helpful, actually. Okay.",1
Thanks for your question.,1
"Yeah. Sort of. I mean I'll watch your product roadmap and be able to tell what the answer is. The other thing, the thing I get in fights with investors about the most is this and I'd love your insight on this. I love the expansion of the new products. The question I have is are they actually on-ramps into the Apple ecosystem, the Beats, the Watch, the AirPods, subscriptions, are they on-ramps into the ecosystem or is the on-ramp to the ecosystem the iPhone and then these new products add revenue per member once you get somebody into the ecosystem via the iPhone?",1
"A lot of people that buy Apple products buy for the whole ecosystem, even though they might not currently use all the different products. And so the way that I think about those products are they're products within the ecosystem itself. And there's the AirPods have really gone through the roof and the Apple Watch has hit an air pocket and has gone to a whole different level as I'd mentioned earlier with our overall wearables revenue. And so in my view, this is a part of the â they are a core part of the ecosystem.",1
But do they attract people to the ecosystem or does the person have to have an iPhone first?,1
"It is, well, but on your point though, it is clear from communications I've had with users that some of them were attracted to iPhone because of the Apple Watch.",1
"Oh, I see.",1
"So the Apple Watch led them to the iPhone. The reverse of that is also true, is that somebody got the iPhone and then decided I really want something to coach me in fitness and to curate some of the communications and so forth like the watch does so well and so it's not always a linear path. I see these things as being somewhat fluid and different for each user.",1
"In terms of our installed base, which is something very important for us as it is one of the key drivers of services, our active installed base on iPhone grew double digits over last year during the quarter and so we're thrilled with that and you can see that carrying through to the services line and the growth that we had there.",1
"And, but I think for us, the thing that we always have to do is come out with a really great innovative product, and I think that iPhone X shows that when you deliver a great innovative product, there's enough people there that would like that and it can be a really good business, and so that's how to look at that.",1
"In terms of replacement cycles, as I'd mentioned I think on a previous call, some replacement cycles are lengthening. I think that the major catalyst for that was probably the subsidy plans becoming a much smaller percentage of total sales around the world than they were at one time and so I think that some are lengthening.",1
"In terms of Apple Music, we're well over 50 million listeners now when you add our paid subscribers and the folks in the trial, and so we're moving along at a very, very good rate. It appears to us or in what we've been told is that we took the leadership position in North America during the quarter and we have the leadership position in Japan, and so in some of the markets that we've been in for a long period of time.",1
"And that'll come from Brian White with Monness, Crespi. And Brian your line is open. Please go ahead.",1
"Yes, Tim. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the multi-year partnership with Oprah Winfrey and what that says about your original content strategy and also Apple Music. If you can give us a little more colors or an update maybe around paid subscribers or total subscribers around Apple Music and how you feel that's rolled out.",1
"Yeah sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. We're very excited to work with Oprah. We think that her incomparable ability and talent to connect with audiences around the world, that there's sort of no match and we think that we can do some great original content together and so we could not be happier in working with Oprah.",1
"As you know, we hired two highly respected television executives last year and they have been here now for several months and have been working on a project that we're not really ready to share all the details of it yet, but I couldn't be more excited about what's going on there and we've got great talent in the area that we've sourced from different places and feel really good about what we will eventually offer.",1
"In terms of the sort of the key catalysts and the changes, the cord cutting in our view is only going to accelerate and probably accelerate at a much faster rate than is widely thought. We're seeing the things that we have on the periphery of this like Apple TV, units and revenue grew by very strong double digits, very, very strong double digits in Q3.",1
"As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing different providers pick up the Apple TV and use it as their box to go to market with their subscription service. There are, within the 300 million-plus paid subscriptions, some of these are third party video subscriptions and we see the growth that is going on there. It's like 100% year-over-year. And so all the things from a â all the forcing functions here from the outside all point to dramatic changes speeding up in the content industry, and so we're really happy to be working on some of them, but we're just not ready to talk about it in depth today.",1
"We're doing quite well, but really, the key thing in music is not the competition between companies that are providing music. It's the real challenge is to grow the market, because if you add everyone up that's providing subscription music today or streaming music, it's, outside of China, it's less than 200 million probably around the world. And so it does seem to me there's an extraordinary opportunity in that business to grow the market well and I think if we put our emphasis there, which we're doing, that will be a beneficiary of that as other people will as well. But I like where we are. Our revenues on Apple Music grew over 50% as I'd mentioned earlier during the quarter, and so some really, really strong results. Thanks for the question.",1
"iPhone revenues are up 20% for the quarter over last year. We're really pleased with that and if you look at the sort of the cycle, which I'll define as Q1, Q2, Q3 for ease, you'll see that we've grown like mid single digits and on an average weekly sales point of view, and of course double digit on the ASP and so I think it's really healthy.",1
Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein has our next question.,1
"Yes. Thank you. I have one for Luca and one for Tim please. Luca, I'm wondering as we think about modeling Q4, iPhone ASPs are typically up sequentially about 2% to 4%, sort of low single digits. Perhaps you can help us think through how we should be thinking about Q4. I know you provided some commentary last quarter on how we should be thinking about Q3 ASPs.",1
"Toni, as you know, we do not provide guidance for either units or ASPs for any product category, but of course we provided guidance on revenue and that the guidance range implies growth of 16% to 19%. We expect the growth to come from strong growth from iPhone, from services and from wearables, which has been a bit of our pattern during the course of the year.",1
"On iPhone ASP, the only thing that I would point out is that obviously we're exiting the June quarter at a significantly higher level than in the past and so that I think is important to keep in mind as we move into the September quarter. It's important to keep in mind the type of revenue growth that we've implied in our guidance.",1
"Okay. Thank you. Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit about the health of the smartphone market. Apple's smartphone iPhone units have been relatively flat for four years and I think you've probably been a share gainer during the period which would suggest at least at the high end of the market, that it's perhaps flat-to-down and I'm wondering if you can comment on, A, whether you believe that and what you think might be happening with replacement cycles. And specifically, also what impact if any you've seen from wider availability and less expensive replacement batteries for iPhones.",1
"I think the smartphone market is very healthy. I think it's actually the best market in the world to be in for someone that is in the business that we're in. It's an enormous sized market and whether it grows, from our point of view, whether it grows 1% or 2% or 5% or 6% or 10% or shrinks 1% or 2%, it's a great market because it's just huge. And so that's kind of the way that I view that.",1
So they're complementary and self-reinforcing? Okay. That makes sense. All right. Thanks very much.,1
That's exactly right. Thank you for the question.,1

"What's more, the Mac ecosystem as a whole is about to get a big boost. At our recent Worldwide Developers Conference, we announced a game-changing tool to help developers easily adapt their iOS and iPadOS apps for the Mac. I'll have a bit more to say on that in a moment.",1
"I'd like to provide some color on our performance in Greater China, where we saw significant improvement compared to the first half of fiscal 2019 and return to growth in constant currency. We experienced noticeably better year-over-year comparisons for our iPhone business there than we saw in the last two quarters and we had sequential improvement in the performance of every category. The combined effects of government stimulus, consumer response to trade-in programs, financing offers, and other sales initiatives and growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem had a positive effect. We were especially pleased with a double-digit increase in services driven by strong growth from the App Store in China.",1
"Turning to the future. Last week we announced an agreement with Intel to acquire the majority of its smartphone modem business. This is our second-largest acquisition by dollars and our largest ever in terms of staff. We're looking forward to welcoming all of them to Apple. We see this as a great opportunity to work with some of the leading talents in this field, to grow our portfolio of wireless technology patents to over 17,000, to expedite our development of our future products and to further our long-term strategy of owning and controlling the primary technologies behind the products that we make.",1
"We also had our best WWDC ever last month, packed with announcements of great new features coming this fall across our four software platforms making them more powerful, more personal and more private.",1

"We had great performance from iPad, with revenue of over $5 billion, and growth driven by iPad Pro and by strong customer response to the new iPad Mini and iPad Air. This was our third consecutive quarter of growth, and with revenue up 15% year-to-date, we feel great about where we're headed with iPad. With our current lineup of iPad, iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro, we've got the perfect device for everyone from young learners to professionals.",1
"In the June quarter, we expanded the availability of the ECG app and a regular rhythm notifications to five additional European countries and added Canada and Singapore just last week, making them available in 31 countries and regions around the world, with more to come later this year. We're very proud of the muscle we've built in bringing regulated products like these to market. This is an important competency that creates exciting opportunities for us moving forward.",1
"As I noted earlier, we believe macOS Catalina will be a breakthrough in the Mac ecosystem. A new tool included in macOS Catalina called Mac Catalyst gives developers a major head start in bringing their iOS apps to the Mac. Thousands of developers are already using it to bring their apps to the Mac ecosystem and we expect to see a wave of popular apps arriving for the Mac as early as this fall.",1
"Again, it's worth taking a step back and digesting the bigger picture here. These updates are the latest steps in a broader strategic effort to make the user experience across iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS and tvOS more effortless and more intuitive. Apple is alone in offering this kind of value and ecosystem to its customers. And these devices and their platforms are unmatched in their ease-of-use, their seamlessness and their privacy and security.",1
"And while providing these things, we've created a dynamic environment where developers benefit greatly from creating for and distributing on these platforms. And our customers, of course, benefit greatly from access to all this creativity and innovation.",1
"We also unveiled other exciting technologies to make it easier and faster for developers to create powerful new apps. SwiftUI provides an intuitive new framework for building sophisticated user interfaces across our software platforms using simple easy-to-use code. Core ML 3 supports the acceleration of more types of advanced real-time machine learning models, and Create ML lets developers build machine learning models without writing code.",1
"We have the world's largest augmented reality enabled platform and thousands of they ARKit-enabled applications in the App Store. Building on this strategy, and our momentum in this area, we introduced three new AR-based technologies. ARKit 3 uses on device, real-time machine learning to recognize the human form and integrates people seamlessly into AR experiences.",1
"We were also very happy with double-digit revenue growth from Mac, fueled by a strong performance of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Looking forward, there's an enormous amount to be excited about for Mac. On the heels of our Mac mini and iMac updates earlier in the fiscal year, we brought significant updates to the bulk of our notebook lineup in the last couple of months. We now have a $999 MacBook Air that is killer for college students. And for our pro users, who push the limits of what a Mac can do, we were thrilled to unveil the most powerful Mac ever, the new Mac Pro and the all new Pro Display XDR, which will be available this fall. They're designed for maximum performance, expansion and configurability and at breakthrough pricing and they're the most powerful tools Apple has ever put in the hands of pro customers.",1
"As I mentioned at the outset, it was another sensational quarter for Wearables, with growth accelerating to well over 50%. We had great results for Apple Watch, which set a new June quarter revenue record and is reaching millions of new users. Over 75% of customers buying Apple Watch in the June quarter were buying their first Apple Watch. We continue to see phenomenal demand for AirPods. And when you tally up the last four quarters, our wearables business is now bigger than 60% of the companies in the Fortune 500.",1
Members of the press with additional questions can contact Josh Rosenstock at 408-862-1142 and financial analysts can contact Matt Blake or me with additional questions. Matt is at 408-974-7406 and I'm at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.,1
"Revenue excluding iPhone was up 17% from last year with growth across all categories. Starting with services, we generated all time record revenue of $11.5 billion that's up 13% year-over-year and if we exclude the $236 million favorable one-time item from the June quarter last year, services growth was 15% or 18% in constant currency which is consistent with our Q2 performance. Our strong services performance was broad based, we set new all-time records for AppleCare, music, cloud services and our app store search ad business and we achieved a new third quarter revenue record for the app store.",1
"Good day, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon and thanks to all of you for joining us today.",1
"We're thrilled to report a return to growth and new June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion. We saw significant improvement in year-over-year iPhone performance compared to last quarter, very strong performances for both Mac and iPad and absolutely blowout quarter for Wearables, but we had accelerating growth of well over 50% and a new high watermark for services, where we set an all time revenue record of $11.5 billion. When you step back and consider Wearables and services together two areas where we have strategically invested in last several years, they now approach the size of a Fortune 50 company.",1
"Geographically, we are happy with our performance across the board including a return to growth in Mainland China. We accomplished these results despite strong headwinds from foreign exchange which impacted our top-line growth rate by 300 basis points compared to a year ago that's equivalent to about $1.5 billion of revenue. Importantly, in constant currency, our revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments.",1
"For iPhone, we generated $26 billion in revenue, while this is down 12% from last year's June quarter, it is a significant improvement to the 17% year-over-year decline in Q2. We are encouraged by the results we are seeing from the initiatives that we spoke about in January including strong customer response to our in-store trade-in and financing programs.",1
"In fact, iPhone our retail and online stores returned to growth on a year-over-year basis in the month of June. Our active installed base of iPhone reached a new all time high and was up year-over-year in each of our top 20 markets underscoring the quality of our products and the satisfaction and loyalty of iPhone customers around the world.",1
"What's more, we had double-digit services revenue growth in all five of our geographic segments. We surpassed 420 million paid subscriptions to services across our platform and we remain on track to double our fiscal year '16 services revenue in 2020.",1
"On a related note, thousands of Apple employees are using Apple Card every day in our beta test, and we plan to begin the rollout of Apple Card in August.",1
"In May, we launched our all new Apple TV app in over 100 countries bringing together all the ways to watch TV in a single app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and select smart TV's. Monthly viewers in the Apple TV app in the United States are up over 40% year-over-year.",1
"We've seen our success being driven here by several factors. First, the fact that we have been able to integrate content from over 150 leading content providers all in one place. Second, the same ease-of-use and unmatched user interface that sets Apple apart in other categories sets us apart in TV as well. And third, we're benefiting from a broader secular move to over-the-top services.",1
"We're engaging with this third trend in five ways. Our Apple TV hardware, Apple TV channels where customers can choose to pay only for the channels they want. Our massive library of over 100,000 iTunes movies and TV shows, the app store where users can find their favorite streaming services and later this year, our original programming service Apple TV+.",1
"Apple Pay is now completing nearly 1 billion transactions per month more than twice the volume of a year ago. Apple Pay launched in 17 countries in the June quarter completing our coverage in the European Union and bringing us to a total of 47 markets currently. Based on June quarter performance, Apple Pay is now adding more new users than PayPal and monthly transaction volume is growing 4x as fast.",1
"In the United States, in addition to a successful integration into Portland's transit system in May, we're beginning to rollout of New York City transit and will launch in Chicago later this year. In China, Apple Pay launched the payment card for Didi the world's largest ride hailing provider.",1
"As I've said before, transit integration is a major driver of a broader digital wallet adoption, and we're going to keep up this push to help users leave their wallet at home in more and more instances.",1
"We will see, Gene. We are working on some stuff that we are really proud of and we will see how it does, and we will announce things when we are ready.",1
"Also, our engineering teams are very sensitive to working with carriers to find the most efficient way to deal with data. And we think that we are the most efficient smartphone on the market for smartphones that are in an app rich ecosystem. And so we are going to continue to focus â focusing on making the best product and I think that the carriers will be very motivated to make sure that they provide that to the customers.",1
"There is always more weapons. And we have more than one tool in the toolbox, but yes, itâs a great way for a buyer to get into the iOS ecosystem and the customer set ratings that we have with iOS 6 and the stickiness of the platform is huge. And so itâs great for customers and we are very glad to offer it.",1
"Just a couple of clarifications. I think you pretty clearly answered that you didnât receive payments from AT&T in the quarter, and I think you said that you will not in the deferred revenue on the balance sheet have anything but iPhone hardware and Apple TV hardware. I just want to confirm that you donât anticipate any of the AT&T payments ever ending up as a deferred item? They will always be simply recognized like normal revenue. Is that a fair interpretation?",1
"We were extremely pleased with our strong growth in both the K to 12 market, where we reached a new all-time high for quarterly Mac sales, as well as the higher ed market, where we sold more Macs than in any previous June quarter.",1
"Now Iâd like to discuss our music products and services, which accounted for 33% of total revenue growth during the quarter. We sold 11 million iPods, an increase of 12% from the year-ago quarter, with the growth being driven by Shuffle as well as the introduction of the iPod Touch last September.",1
"We were pleased with the iPod sales growth of 10% in the United States and 15% internationally. iPod revenue grew 7% year over year, less than the unit rate of growth, due to lower ASPs driven largely by the Shuffle price reduction taken in February. Weâre happy with the demand elasticity that weâve seen for the iPod Shuffle and think the tradeoff between ASP and units was a good one.",1
"We were very successful in maintaining our high MP3 market share in the U.S. during the quarter and gaining share internationally. Our share is now over 70% in both the United States and Australia, over 60% in Canada, and over 50% in the U.K., Japan, and Switzerland, based on the latest published data from NPD, GFK, and BCN. We have strong double-digit share in numerous other European and Asian countries and we continue to gain share year over year in most countries for which we have data.",1
"The iTunes store achieved a number of milestones during the quarter and sales were once again very strong. As we indicated last month, we have now sold over 5 billion songs through iTunes and continue to build on our industry-leading catalog of content, which features over 8 million songs, 20,000 TV episodes, and 2,200 films, including over 450 in HD.",1
"In the June quarter, we introduced new content from HBO to iTunes in the U.S., premiered movies in Canada and the U.K., and introduced television programming in Germany, France, and Australia. iTunes also began offering new movies from major studios and premier independent studios on the same dates as they became available on DVD.",1
"During the June quarter, we shipped 717,000 first generation iPhones, and recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, accessories, and carrier payments of $419 million. As we indicated previously, because we announced the iPhone 2.0 software and its many new features on March 6th but did not make it available until this month, we did not begin recognizing handset revenue for any iPhones sold on or after March 6th until we made the iPhone 2.0 software available.",1
"For those phones recognized -- for those phones, we began recognizing handset revenue on July 11th and we will continue to do so over the respective remaining terms of their 24-month estimated economic lives. Therefore, any iPhone handset revenue recognized during the June quarter relates to iPhones sold prior to March 6th.",1
"Weâre off to a great start with the iPhone 3G. We have begun shipping in 22 countries. As we announced last week, we sold our 1 millionth iPhone 3G just three days after its launch, in contrast to the 74 days it took us to sell 1 million first generation iPhones. Customer reaction to the iPhone 3G has been overwhelmingly positive and we look forward to getting it into the hands of many more customers around the world in the coming weeks and months.",1
"We launched the App Store on July 11th with a tremendous selection of innovative applications, such as games, advanced medical solutions, and robust productivity tools for the enterprise. The App Store currently offers more than 900 applications, with more than 20% that are free and more than 90% priced at less than $10. Customers are really loving the App Store and the iPhone and iPod Touch users have already downloaded over 25 million applications. We believe this amazing selection of mobile applications will continue to keep us years ahead of the competition.",1
"I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which delivered very strong results with revenue growing 58% year over year to $1.44 billion. The store sold 476,000 Macs during the quarter, an increase of 44% year over year, and over half were sold to customers who have never owned a Mac before. The stores also provided a record high 598,000 personal training sessions during the quarter, helping customers to learn more about their Apple products.",1
"We opened eight stores during the quarter, including our store on Boylston Street in Boston and our first store in Australia to end the quarter with 216 stores. With an average of 211 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $6.8 million compared to $5.1 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 33%. Retail segment margin was $297 million, compared to $184 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 61%.",1
Weâre on track to end fiscal 2008 with 242 stores. We opened our first store in Beijing this past weekend and we look forward to extending our international retail store presence by opening stores in Switzerland and Germany during the second half of this calendar year.,1
"Total company gross margin was 34.8%, which exceeded our guidance by about 180 basis points as a result of several factors. First, we realized a net benefit to gross margin of about 70 basis points, primarily related to a one-time true-up of our contractor or contract manufacturer deferred margin. Second, the remaining 110 basis points resulted primarily from a better commodity environment, a richer product mix, and leverage from higher-than-expected revenue.",1
"Operating expenses were $1.21 billion, including $112 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $118 million. The tax rate for the quarter was 29%, below our guidance of 31% due to a higher-than-anticipated mix of foreign earnings.",1
"Weâve been thrilled with the momentum of our Mac business. In the U.S. channels tracked and reported by NPD, Apple's share of total personal computers sold in the month of June increased to 19.5% this year from 15.4% last year, and it was the best Mac quarter ever for our U.S. education business, with unit growth of 25% year over year.",1
"Mac desktop sales grew sharply at 49% year over year, driven by strong demand for iMac which we updated in April. Sales of portables were up 37% year over year, driven by continued growth in demand for Macbooks and Macbook Pros, and the addition of Macbook Air to the portable lineup in January.",1
"I would like to now talk about our Mac products and services, which represented 61% of our total revenue in the June quarter. Weâre extremely pleased to have shipped 2.5 million Macs, the greatest number of Macs shipped in any quarter in Apple's history. This translates into 41% year-over-year growth and is nearly three times the overall PC market rate of growth for the June quarter based on the latest estimate published by IDC.",1
"No specific or even qualitative goals that you might be able to share, where do you think you can take that?",1
"Just on the gross margin for iPhone, in the past you have said if products are above what your corporate average is or not. Will you confirm if the gross margin on the iPhone for June is above your gross margin corporate average?",1
"While we are off to a great start with iPhone and sold 270,000 in the last 30 hours, the revenue contribution in the quarter was $5 million and the vast majority of that was accessories. So the impact to the quarter was very small.",1
You guys are reiterating your goals 10 million units for â08 now. Should we assume this is only the European and U.S. markets that you have announced so far or does this include possible broader expansion of the phone internationally?,1
We plan to go into a few major countries in Europe next quarter; to move across other countries in Europe across 2008 and to enter Asia in 2008 as well.,1
"So that would include Asia. My last question is just on the Mac business, as you mentioned it was a terrific print for the quarter in the Mac business and you continue to grow as a multiple of both U.S. and worldwide growth. Given the fact that you have refreshes here, you have kept ASPs quite constant, do you have any market share aspirations? Or internally, what you guys think you can do vis-a-vis continuing to grow your market shares? We see you entering Best Buy and continue to do very well internationally as well.",1
We are focused on making the very best products and we believe if we do that then our share will rise.,1
"No, we are not setting specific market share goals.",1
"In looking at our performance for the first six months of calendar 2008, Apple's total revenue increased by $4.3 billion year over year, a very impressive growth rate of 40%. We are very proud of these results.",1
"Good day and welcome to this Apple Incorporated Apple fiscal year 2008 third quarter results conference call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, Madam.",1
"Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today may consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, iPhone sales, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings, and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2007, the Form 10-Q for the first two quarters of fiscal 2008, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the highest June quarter revenue and earnings in Apple's history. Revenue in the quarter was $7.46 billion, representing 38% growth and an increase of more than $2 billion over the previous June quarterâs revenue of $5.41 billion. The strong year-over-year growth was driven by the highest quarterly Mac shipments ever and higher revenue from iPod, iTunes, and iPhone, which celebrated its first anniversary on June 29th.",1
"Operating margin for the quarter was better than expected at 18.6%, due primarily to higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin. Net income was $1.07 billion, which was up 31% over the prior June quarterâs results, and translated to earnings per share of $1.19.",1
"Before getting into the details of the quarterâs results, I would like to begin with a few points that demonstrate how well Apple has continued to perform. The current June quarterâs revenue growth of 38% was significantly above the 24% growth rate we achieved in last yearâs June quarter and we continued to see healthy growth in all regions. Sales in our retail stores, most of which are in the U.S., were extremely strong, growing 58% year over year and store traffic was about 32 million, up 10 million from the year-ago quarter.",1
"We generated $1.33 billion in cash during the quarter, ending with $20.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was $1.32 billion. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2008, Apple generated over $5.4 billion in cash on $3.7 billion in net income. The primary contributor to the difference between our reported income and our cash growth is the tremendous cash generation from iPhone sales that has not been fully reflected as earnings yet due to subscription accounting.",1
"Looking ahead to the September quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. For the quarter, we are targeting revenue of about $7.8 billion, or approximately 25% growth over the prior September quarter. Weâre off to a great start with the iPhone 3G and expect to sell more iPhones this quarter than we have in any other quarter thus far.",1
"Under subscription accounting, iPhone sales today will have limited impact on reported results in the quarter sold. However, those sales will build significant revenue and earnings that will be reported in future quarters.",1
Tim.,1
"And the channel inventory, we did end at three to four weeks. We still feel that four to five weeks is the appropriate target.",1
Weâll hear from Ben Reitzes with Lehman Brothers.,1
"Good afternoon. Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about gross margins? Obviously so good in the quarter, even taking out the 70 basis points, and then you are guiding to 31.5. Could we just talk a little bit about the changes in commodity environment, in particular maybe a little bit more about -- it sounds like itâs more the BTS promo, back-to-school promo and the product transition excluding the true-up here, but could you just talk a little bit more about what you think components will do and why?",1
"Let me start by just going through some of the factors that caused us to do a little better in June, what we see for the September quarter, and then Tim can answer your commodity question. And then Iâd actually like to follow-up after Tim does and talk a little bit about what we see in some future quarters.",1
"In the June quarter, we did do about 180 basis points better than our guidance, and this was driven, as I said in my prepared remarks, by a one-time true-up that we had with our contract manufacturer deferred margin about 70 basis points. The remaining 110 was primarily driven by a better commodity environment than we planned, a bit richer of a product mix and leverage from the higher revenue.",1
"As I look forward to the September quarter, I would see gross margin being about 31.5%, down from the 34.8% as a result of primarily three factors: first the full quarter impact of the back-to-school promotion that we are running; second, weâve got a future product transition that I canât discuss with you today; and then finally, the one-time true-up with the contract manufacturer deferred margin wonât repeat.",1
"Ben, on some of the key components on LCDs and NAND Flash, we expect a favorable cost environment. The DRAM market is entering a seasonally stronger demand period relative to where itâs been and we believe that price will recover from these historically low levels until we see increases in this area.",1
"Thank you. Tim, could you talk about how many Best Buy stores you added in the quarter? And then Peter, as a follow-up, it looks like you are still below your target range on Mac channel inventory. Is the target range changing or at some point should we expect the Mac inventories to get back to the sort of four to five week range that youâve talked about historically?",1
"Hard drives, optical drives, and most other commodities are in supply/demand balance and we envision these trends following historical norms.",1
"Okay, so I mean basically though, it sounds like you guys may reprice or rethink about how you are pricing maybe with some of the transitions and you want to drive a lot of volume. Is there any change in the companyâs philosophy in terms of margin and volume, or stay tuned?",1
"Ben, let me talk a little bit about what I would see beyond the September quarter for margins. As you know, we canât discuss future products so the first part of your question, weâre not able to answer today.",1
"Weâre delivering state-of-the-art products at price points that our competitors canât match, which has resulted in market share gains in each of our products. We plan to continue this strategy and to deliver great value to our customers while making a reasonable margin but not a margin so high as to leave an umbrella for our competitors.",1
"In addition, and one of the investments that we make is to introduce new products that initially cost more because they deliver an entirely new level of value to the customer. Then we ride the cost curves down with value engineering and volume manufacturing, leaving us far ahead of our competitors.",1
"We have some of these types of investments in front of us that I canât discuss with you today and we plan to continue to execute this strategy in the future. As we look beyond the September quarter, we would anticipate gross margins being about 30% in fiscal 2009. We are very confident in our new product pipeline, our growth opportunities, and the decisions we are making for our future.",1
"We added about 170 Best Buy stores across the quarter. That brings us to a total of about 570, and we plan to be at around 600 by the end of the summer. Globally, we now have about 10,300 storefronts carrying the Macintosh, and thatâs up about 1,600 storefronts year over year.",1
"From Citigroup, weâll hear from Richard Gardner.",1
"We expect gross margin to be about 31.5%, reflecting approximately $23 million related to stock-based compensation expense, down from 34.8% in the June quarter. This sequential decline is expected due to three primary factors; first, the full quarter impact of the back-to-school promotion; second, a future product transition, which I canât discuss today; and third, the one-time true-up of our contract manufacturer deferred margin that we realized in the June quarter.",1
"Okay. Bill, for the quarter, we are targeting revenue of about $7.8 billion, which is 25% growth over last September. We have included in our revenue guidance the full quarter ASP impact of the back-to-school promotion, a future product transition that I canât discuss today, and also the elasticity that weâve seen from the iPod Shuffle price reduction and itâs result on ASP.",1
"We expect OpEx to be about $1.270 billion, including $125 million related to stock-based compensation.",1
We expect OI&E to be about $120 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 30.5%. We expect to generate EPS of about $1.,1
"In closing, we are very pleased with our results. Weâve just reported the strongest quarterly Mac sales in Apple's history and have completed a fabulous first year with the iPhone. Weâre very enthusiastic about iPhone 3G, as well as the potential of the developer community and the App Store to provide outstanding applications to make the iPhone and the iPod Touch even richer experiences for our customers.",1
"We expect revenues in fiscal 2008 to be about $32.4 billion, an increase of 35% year over year. We also remain very excited about our product pipeline and look forward to delivering more great new products later this year.",1
(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Bill Fearnley with FTN Midwest.,1
"Thanks. Peter, you mentioned quickly here future product transitions and its effect on gross margins. Is there a corresponding effect on revenue growth here that you are expecting in the September quarter? Because the September quarter revenue growth quite frankly looks conservative. Does the product transition affect revenue growth expectations as well? And then I just have a quick follow-up.",1
"I would tell you that we are very happy with our revenue growth and weâve just reported the best Mac quarter ever and double-digit iPod growth, and are off to a fantastic start with the iPhone 3G.",1
"Bill, weâve not announced our plans for â09 but as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect to end fiscal â08 at 242 stores. That is up 45 from last year.",1
"We expect to sell more iPhones this quarter than we have in any previous quarter, but this will have a limited impact on the September quarter but will build a significant revenue and earnings, which weâll report in future quarters. If iPhone sales were reported as revenue when sold, the September revenue guidance would be significantly higher.",1
"Okay, thanks. And then a lot of folks are talking about Apple's penetration in emerging markets. Could you give additional color about sales outside the U.S. for Mac and iPod in particularly here? Any additional color in terms of where you saw upside surprises and then any additional color you can give preliminarily on the few days that youâve been out there in the China? Thanks.",1
"Europe had an outstanding quarter. Revenue grew at 43%, so higher than the overall company, and Japan for the third straight quarter has grown higher than the overall company this quarter at 40%. And Asia-Pacific continues to do extremely well, with a year-over-year increase in the Mac area of 53%. And so if you look at the Mac areas in each one, Europe was growing at about four times the market, according to IDC. Japan was growing at four to five times. Asia-Pacific was growing at two to three times.",1
"In terms of some of the markets that you mentioned, we had several markets in the developing market area that were growing over 50% in revenue year over year, such as China, Russia, and Latin America. But surprisingly, we also saw some of the more mature markets growing at over 50% year over year, such as France and Germany and Australia.",1
"So overall, it was a very, very strong quarter in every major geographic region. And the store is off to a good start in Beijing. Weâre very happy with what we see there thus far.",1
"And one last question, if I could, on the new stores; any change to your expectations here for store openings in the next 12 months?",1
"I am sorry, could you repeat the question?",1
"On the margin profile for the iPhone, obviously you wonât give it, but in the past you have said certain products are above your corporate average. Will you confirm if the iPhoneâs gross margins were about the corporate average for the June quarter?",1
"We donât disclose the specifics Matt, but I would tell you that the mix skewed to the 8 gig for early sales in June.",1
"The retail stores had an outstanding quarter. The revenue was up in total 33%, Mac shipments were up 53% and 24% on a per store basis. We are seeing very strong traffic through the stores, clearly selling a lot of Macs and other products. There is tremendous interest in the phone and I think the stores has benefited from all three of our product areas and are seeing very strong traffic interest and the results have been just tremendous.",1
"The second was just again to clarify in terms of the accounting treatment, relative to what you are going to recognize in the deferred revenues going forward, can you clarify for us what you are going to put in there?",1
"In terms of the corporate market, we think the iPhone is a breakthrough product for all customers, including business customers. Itâs a great Internet device that includes the best email client out there with the best web-browser ever on a mobile device. With a very little bit of help from the corporate IT department, it can be set up to work with corporate email. We already have a number of corporate customers that are piloting the iPhone in their enterprises and they have told us that they are very happy with the results so far.",1
"With regard to your deferred revenue question, we provided to you the deferred revenue schedule this quarter. For iPhone and Apple TV it has $180 million of total deferred revenue which again related only to the hardware from the iPhone and from Apple TV, so there was no accessories revenue included in this or payments from AT&T.",1
We will provide a similar schedule to you in October to the September quarter and I will walk you through then how the various revenue streams impacted the financials.,1
Your next question comes from Keith Bachman - Banc Of America.,1
"Peter, on the CPUs, a healthy growth. The retail, which is moved around a little bit was really the standout this quarter in terms of unit growth rates for CPUs, and Japan again was weak. Could you offer a little color what was going on in retail that caused it to be such a standout this quarter and any kind of expectations given the brand awareness that iPhone is creating? Would you expect that to help us for the retail CPU business as we look forward to the September quarter?",1
"Peter, could you give us some updated commentary on expectations if you can on store openings as you look out over the next couple of quarters?",1
Your next question comes from Bear Stearnsâ Andrew Neff.,1
"We expect to open 12 stores in the September quarter to end of year with 197 and we have not set a target yet for fiscal â08 openings, I will share those with you in October.",1
Your next question comes from Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers.,1
"Peter, youâre using period accounting on the iPhone launch for the expenses incurred in the quarter. Could you give us a sense of how much those were within the OpEx line?",1
"Harry, I will talk more qualitatively. We certainly provided some extra staffing in our stores for the launch and for our online stores and our support areas. I think you saw tremendous marketing in advertising from the company on iPhone, so we certainly saw added expenses.",1
As you indicated and we had discussed before we are taking the operating expense related to iPhone as period expense while recognizing the revenue over 24 months.,1
Could you give us a sense of Apple TV units? They are not discreetly broken out here.,1
"Two things. One of the comments, you have seen a lot of reviews about the issue about corporate email. Are there thoughts relative to the phone about trying to address that market? Have you had any discussions with some of the major providers of corporate email along those lines or thought about how you can try to address that corporate market?",1
We saw absolutely no obvious evidence during the June quarter. We will obviously monitor that this quarter and report this quarter in the October conference call.,1
"Okay, but itâs not included in the iPhone numbers, correct?",1
"We donât really comment on our product plan, but we believe the iPhone offers tremendous value that customers couldnât even have imagined before. As you know, this is really three products in one; itâs a revolutionary mobile phone, a widescreen iPod, and Internet in your pocket with the best, desktop class e-mail, web browsing and map applications ever on a mobile phone before. We think customers are clearly seeing that, as witnessed by the customer satisfaction ratings that we talked about.",1
"We will record, as I said, the payments from AT&T as revenues over time as earned, and I will talk to you about next quarter when we report to you our deferred revenue at the end of the September quarter, if it included any payments from AT&T.",1
You will clarify next quarter within the deferred revenue balance or the just regular recognized revenue from these payments from AT&T then?,1
Yes I will.,1
But certainly the possibility there is open. Youâre not categorically saying that it wonât end up that way?,1
Not making a comment at this point. We will report to you next quarterâs results in October.,1
"Just a broader question about the iPhone price points over time. If we look at the history of your iPod business, you started at higher price points then ultimately had a broad line all the way down to Shuffle at $79. Obviously the first iPhone is at $500 or $600. Should we reasonably assume that over time you will have a broader line and lower price points and a family of phones to choose from?",1
Your next question comes from Rob Semple - Credit Suisse.,1
"I know itâs very early, but have you seen any evidence of iPod cannibalization from iPhone?",1
"In the context of top line growth, can you just walk us through how you think about seasonality in both the iPod and the Mac businesses for September?",1
Sure. Let me begin with Mac. The June quarter begins the education buying season. Sequential seasonality from June to September has been mixed. Some years have experienced a slight increase and some years have experienced a slight decrease.,1
"For iPods, in terms of assessing MP3 seasonality, we have learned over the last few years that what drives the market to new levels is innovative product launches and seasonal buying in the holiday, December quarter. Last year, iPod sales were up about 8% from June to September, driven by the new suite of iPods and iPod Nanos that we introduced in September.",1
"Peter, do you worry about any sort of slowdown or pause in front of Leopard? I know historically you havenât really seen that in the Mac business ahead of OS 10 launches, but anything different with an installed base that tends to be more heavily weighed towards traditional Windows users?",1
"We will have to see what happens, but I would point out that this past quarter is the highest Mac sales the company ever had and the Macs we are shipping today are the absolute best products we have ever shipped.",1
"Also, the upgrade process is very, very straightforward and simple.",1
We donât announce that level of product detail.,1
"It is not, itâs a separate category. Itâs reported in the other music category as an accessory.",1
Any qualitative commentary on the 8 gig versus 4 gig?,1
"From JP Morgan, this is Bill Shope.",1
"In the June quarter of this year, it was 53% of revenue and that was up from 49% in the year-ago quarter.",1
"One last question on the component side, any issues with availability during the quarter or any issues with availability of components in the quarter that we are currently in for 4Q? Thanks.",1
"For the last quarter, we ended the channel inventory in the three to four-week range in the Mac. And as you know, thatâs outside of our range on the low side. We announced a new MacBook Pro in early June and weâre not able to get enough inventory in the channel by the end of the quarter.",1
"For this quarter, our view about supply and demand have been factored those in the revenue guidance that Peter has talked about.",1
"What about on the components side, any availability issues on components?",1
"Well, ultimately components are generally what drives the supply. So again, we factored our view of supply and demand into our guidance.",1
"Historically looking at the iPod business, we saw a very small incremental OpEx increased per dollar of iPod revenues and clearly this provided you with a lot of historical leverage. Can you give us any color on how we should think about the incremental OpEx that would be required for the iPhone going forward? Obviously Iâm only looking for qualitative color here.",1
"Bill, I think that generally we are going to have to talk to you about that in 90 days. I did discuss some of the seasonality that we expect. We are in the back-to-school season. The June quarter tends to be more dominated by our K-12; higher ed is strong, but it tends to be a little bit K-12 focused whereas in the September quarter it tends to be a bit more high ed focused. I have walked you through what we have traditionally seen for iPods in the September quarter.",1
"Well, as I commented earlier, Bill, we are recording the OpEx for iPhone, whether it be R&D or sales and marketing or advertising as period expense. So weâre taking that absent [ph] and spreading the revenue over a two-year period of time. So we are taking that and spreading the revenue over a two-year period of time. So in the early quarters of our iPhone sales when we are incurring the expense and we are beginning to sell iPhones, but again amortizing the revenue over 24 months, you really carry more of the expense burden. Over time, that relationship is going to change.",1
"It may be too early for this question, but do you have any early demographic statistics on the iPhones buyers that you can share at this point?",1
"In terms of demographic statistics, I donât, but again some of the market research that we have seen -- and one report in particular, it was quoted in the USA Today indicated that 90% of iPhone owners surveyed were extremely or very satisfied with their iPhones and 85% said they were extremely or very likely to recommend the iPhones to others.",1
From W. R. Hambrecht this is Matt Kather.,1
Could you disclose what the ASP for the iPhone was in the quarter or are we left to guess given the deferred statistics that you have disclosed?,1
More the latter.,1
"Also on the direct mix, you said that direct was helping margins. Could you give us the direct versus indirect mix for the quarter?",1
"Switching gears here back to Macintosh if I could. You talked about the effect of product transitions potentially on gross margins here for the upcoming quarter. Is there going to be any effect potentially on revenue, revenue mix or revenue growth here? I mean, if you look at the product transition, again youâve talked about margins, but what about on the revenue side?",1
Your cash assets currently account for about two-thirds of your total assets. I am wondering if we still have any change in thinking about the use of cash?,1
"T hat was a very strategic investment for us and we are even more sure today that it was the right approach for us than we were then as we begin to use more and more flash in all of our products, including now the iPhone.",1
"We still discuss this with the board from time to time, but donât have a change to share with you today.",1
"Lastly, coming back to the gross margin guidance Peter, if I just do a simple math on the numbers, it basically says youâre looking for about a $600 million absolute sequential increase in COGS relative to the revenue. Even with the back-to-school promotions and perhaps product transitions, relative to the sales of hardware thatâs still an awful large number.",1
Can you may be help with that again because the math doesnât seem to work real well unless you have a massive spike in commodity prices or unless you significantly cut the cost of your average CPU?,1
"Harry, Iâm sorry. Thatâs not a question I think Iâm really going to be able to answer for you this quarter, we will talk to you about it next quarter. I have shared with you the three primary factors that will cause our gross margin to decline sequentially, and all three are going to contribute.",1
Your next question comes from Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley.,1
"Just a follow-up on the component discussion, how should we think about your ability to leverage the prepaid NAND Flash that sits on your balance sheet from 2005 as that market becomes tighter in the back half of the year?",1
"And then on MAC front, consumer MAC units obviously very strong again this quarter, but it also looks like desktop units and ASPs are stronger than expected. Did you in fact see a good acceleration on the commercial side of the business post the April product announcement?",1
"Next is Bill Fearnley, FTN Midwest.",1
"It was an overall blowout quarter for the Mac. It was the absolute best quarter we have ever had. We sold more portables than we ever had, weâve sold more total units than we ever had. The education market was the best education quarter we have ever had, and also to answer your question, the pro business had a nice uptick as we shipped a new version of Final Cut Studio and Adobe shipped Creative Suite 3. So really, all of the markets really kicked in nicely this quarter.",1
From RBC Capital Markets this is Michael Abramsky.,1
"Thanks very much. Are you expecting a similar reception in Europe when you launch the iPhone? It is a little bit the different market, so could you just tell us a little bit how you approach the market? I think 3G is perhaps a little bit more important and obviously competitors like Nokia and other are very entrenched there?",1
"The way that we look at this is that the iPhone is a breakthrough product and we think it is great for Americans and Europeans and everyone else and in all markets, and so we are very excited to get going there, are spending a lot of energy on this and later in the quarter we will be announcing some details about which carriers we will be working with.",1
"Is there any high level commentary you can make? I think going into the launch of the iPhone you did talk about some of the learning experiences that you plan to have, just on issues of pricing, reaction to consumer pricing, network speed, is there anything surprising that you have adapted to, either positively or negatively, that have come from the early experiences youâve had with sales?",1
"We have only been at this for a few weeks. We are very much beginners at this and so everyday there is something to learn. Again, we are very focused on building the business over the very long term and we are looking forward to taking the next step with expanding geographically into Europe next quarter.",1
"Okay, thanks. And then my last thing is just I would like to ask it as respectfully as possible; a New York newspaper today obviously called into question some issues around Steve and obviously his health, and we get a lot of questions about it and Iâm really sorry to ask, because itâs a very private matter, but would you mind addressing the situation and just making it so we can have your official statement? And I apologize in advance for having to ask the question.",1
"Ben, Steve loves Apple. He serves as the CEO at the pleasure of Apple's board and has no plans to leave Apple. Steveâs health is a private matter.",1
"From Pacific Crest Securities, weâll hear from Andy Hargreaves.",1
And so we feel great about how we are doing in Japan. Itâs quite the turnaround from how we were doing in 2006.,1
"Thanks, Yair. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"With American Technology, weâll hear from Shaw Wu.",1
"Thanks. Just a quick question, I guess perhaps for Tim, just on the Japan business. It looks like it somewhat regressed this quarter, after some improvement over the last two quarters. Just any comments there in terms of how do you feel about that business?",1
"And then just to revisit the iPod ASP question, understand that your back-to-school promotion definitely has some impact there but despite that, it seems like it was down a little bit more than expected. Is that a function of mix or is it -- would you attribute that to the back-to-school promotion? Thanks.",1
"Shaw, very happy with how our Japan subsidiary is doing. They are off to a great start in fiscal 2007. In each of the first three quarters, theyâve exceeded the companyâs overall revenue growth rate and if youâve noticed that this past quarter, they grew at 40% year over year versus the companyâs growth at 38%. And I think that is particularly good when you think about how the markets there are doing.",1
"In the PC industry, IDC was predicting a 5% year-over-year increase for the market. The Macintosh was up 23% in units, so up four to five times. Our share improved year over year from about 4% to 5%, and in iPods, our share grew about 10 points year over year, up to 56% in May, according to BCN.",1
"Shaw, in your follow-up on your iPod ASP question, it was down sequentially really as a result of the full quarter impact of the iPod Shuffle on price decrease. The back-to-school promotion, while we started it in the first part of June, really will have its biggest impact over the summer months, so that didnât play a particularly large role within that.",1
"So just to be clear, this implies that these new products will actually be shipping or being built in this quarter?",1
"And as we said, we are very happy with the elasticity that weâve seen on the iPod Shuffle and think the tradeoff between ASP and units was a good one.",1
Thanks for the color.,1
"Thanks, Shaw. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone, and the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112, or 719-457-0820. And the confirmation code is 4120259. And these replays will be available beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896. Financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions, and Joan is at 408-974-4570 and Iâm at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
"Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude todayâs presentation. We do thank everyone for your participation. Have a wonderful day.",1
"Good day and welcome to this Apple Incorporated third quarter fiscal year 2009 earnings release conference call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Madam.",1
"Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share, and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts.",1
"I canât get into our new product pipeline but I have told you regarding the September quarter, that one of the reasons that we see gross margin being down sequentially is because of a product transition, yes.",1
"Sure. We have been introducing state-of-the-art new products that have technologies and features that our competition just canât match. And when we do that early in introduction, our costs are higher and then we work to bring costs down over time with value engineering and with volume manufacturing.",1
"And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer.",1
Weâre very confident in achieving the 10 million for calendar year â08.,1
Weâll be very aggressive.,1
"How under-penetrated do you think this iPhone market -- excuse me, the smartphone market as it relates to iPhone is globally? This is obviously a product that does require a fairly high cost commitment from a number of users. We canât ignore -- weâre not talking about economy, I recognize, but we certainly canât ignore the pressures globally. What evidence do you see that this market can support a sustained level of the kind of growth that youâve experienced out of the gate for this iPhone opportunity?",1
"Well you know, as I said before, weâre not predicting units other than the prediction that we made some time ago about this year, which we are extremely confident in achieving. But we believe that we are growing the market and that many people really didnât have a full view of what a phone could do until we announced the iPhone. And so we think that there will be a shift in the phone industry over time to more and more people wanting a smartphone versus a standard voice phone.",1
"And would you say that you donât see the kind of cost commitment that is in front of people to get those new desires, to get the things that they are desiring being a headwind to market growth for the next foreseeable future?",1
"We did see it being a headwind at the $400 U.S. dollar price, and as we share some time about, about 50% of the people that we surveyed told us that they would have bought an iPhone had it not been for the price, and so with a change in business model, which gets the iPhone to a price of $199 in the U.S., and a price similar to that in local currencies on specific tariffs outside the U.S. in many countries, we believe we are addressing that key concern and the market for the iPhone will expand dramatically.",1
"And just lastly, are you reaffirming your 10 million CY08 iPhone goal?",1
"From Oppenheimer & Company, weâll hear from Yair Reiner.",1
"Got it. Just a final question on the gross margin guidance for the following quarter; I understand the comments about new product innovation. I donât quite understand why that would impact gross margins rather than OpEx and the R&D line; if you can help us think through that, it would be great.",1
A quick question first on the back-to-school promotion. Can you walk us through the accounting of that and how you account for the iPods that are given away and what happens to the ASPs?,1
"Sure. In our retail stores, for example, if you are a qualifying student and you buy a qualifying Mac and an iPod, we will send you a rebate for the cost of the iPod, and again itâs a qualifying Mac and iPod.",1
We account for the rebate as a reduction in revenue and it is done proportionately to both the Mac and the iPod in proportion to the revenue related to the Mac and the iPod sales.,1
"Got it. And on iPods, ASPs obviously down quite a bit in the quarter because of the higher Shuffle mix. Is this the mix that we should look at moving forward? And how do you see the overall iPod business developing now that itâs clearly getting some competition, at least, from the iPhone?",1
"We donât provide guidance at the product level. We were very happy with our iPhone sales in the June quarter. We grew 10% in the U.S., 15% internationally, gained share internationally, which we were very happy with.",1
"As a result -- as regards the iPhone, itâs hard to precisely tell but there likely was some element of cannibalization and our view is that if there is going to be iPod cannibalization, we want it to be from the iPhone.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2008, the Form 10-Q for the first two quarters of fiscal 2009, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the record June quarter revenue and earnings and to once again report the highest non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings in Apple's history.",1
"Mike, I would add to that that we are very excited about our App Store, and as I said in my prepared remarks, in just a bit over a week, there are now over 900 applications available to customers and in just over a week, customers on iPhone and iPod Touch have already downloaded over 25 million applications.",1
"We opened six new stores during the quarter, bringing us to 258 stores, and we also completed 27 store remodels.",1
Customer response to the App Store has been phenomenal and we were thrilled to announce the 1.5 billionth download last week.,1
The App Store is a key strategic differentiator of the iPhone and iPod Touch experience and we believe that outstanding software is the key ingredient for a great mobile experience.,1
"Recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales, and carrier payments was $1.69 billion during the quarter, compared to $419 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of over 300%. The sales value of iPhones sold during the quarter was $2.9 billion.",1
"Since we announced specific new features of iPhone OS 3.0 on March 17th, we did not begin to recognize revenue or product costs for any iPhone sold from March 17th until the iPhone OS 3.0 software became available on June 17th. For those iPhones, revenue and product costs are being recognized ratably over the remaining terms of their respective 24-month estimated lives from June 17th forward.",1
"The iTunes Store delivered another great quarter, fueled by strong sales of music, video, and apps. With the introduction of the iPhone OS 3.0 last month, the iTunes experience keeps getting better. iPhone OS 3.0 software allows customers to wirelessly download movies, TV, and audio programs directly to an iPhone or iPod Touch and I am pleased to report that as of last week, customers had purchased and downloaded over 8 billion songs from the iTunes store, yet another remarkable milestone.",1
"I would like to now turn to the Apple retail stores. The stores recognized $1.5 billion of revenue during the June quarter, compared to $1.45 billion in the year-ago quarter. Our stores sold 492,000 Macs compared to 476,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter and about half the Macs sold in our stores during the June quarter were to customers who never owned a Mac before.",1
"With an average of 254 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $5.9 million compared to $6.8 million in the year-ago quarter.",1
"Customers are loving the new iPhone OS 3.0 release, which includes more than 100 new features, including cut, copy, and paste, MMS, spotlight search, a landscape keyboard for mail, and expanded parental controls for iTunes and App Store content.",1
"Retail segment margin was $321 million, or 21.5%, up from $297 million or 20.6% in the year-ago quarter.",1
"We hosted 38.6 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 31.7 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 22%.",1
"We successfully launched the new and improved one-to-one program and hosted a record 667,000 personal training sessions during the quarter.",1
We remain on track to open a total of about 25 stores during fiscal 2009 and to complete the remodel of 100 stores to our new design.,1
We are also looking forward to opening our first store in France during the holiday quarter.,1
"Total company gross margin was 36.3%, which was 330 basis points better than our guidance. This difference was primarily driven by three factors. First, component costs did increase but not to the level we had expected.",1
"The App Store now offers over 65,000 applications and the iPhone OS 3.0 software has helped pave the way for developers to create even more innovation applications with many new features, including in-App purchases, a new maps API, peer-to-peer connections, and push notification.",1
"Customers and reviewers have been very impressed by its improved speed, 3-megapixel autofocus camera, video recording capability, and hands-free voice control. The iPhone 3GS is available in 18 countries today and we are quickly rolling it out this summer to the rest of the 80-plus countries where iPhones are sold.",1
It was an extremely busy quarter for new product introductions and customers have responded enthusiastically.,1
"Mac portable shipments increased 13% year over year, driven by continued strong growth in sales of Macbooks and our new Macbook Pros. Customer response to the new portables has been very favorable and we saw an acceleration of sales following the launch.",1
"Revenue for the June quarter was $8.34 billion, representing 12% growth over the prior June quarterâs results. We are very proud of this results, particularly given the economic environment around us.",1
"Operating margin percentage for the quarter was over 20%, higher than our guidance due to better-than-expected revenue and gross margin. Net income was $1.23 billion, which translated to earnings per share of $1.35.",1
"In terms of non-GAAP measures, adjusted sales totaled $9.7 billion for the June quarter, which was $1.4 billion higher than our reported revenue. Adjusted gross margin was $4 billion, which was $1 billion higher than our reported gross margin. And adjusted net income was $1.9 billion, $700 million higher than our reported net income.",1
We continue to believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide added transparency to our business and hope they are helpful to you in you analysis and understanding of our performance.,1
"Turning to the details of our results, I would like to begin with our Mac products and services. We generated outstanding sales of 2.6 million Macs, setting a new June quarter record and nearly meeting the all-time quarterly record we set last September. Mac sales increased by more than 100,000 units over the prior yearâs June quarter. This represents 4% year-over-year growth and compares favorably to IDCâs latest published estimate of a 3% contraction for the market overall.",1
"We followed up the transition of our entire desktop lineup in March with significant updates to our entire portable lineup in the June quarter, delivering increased performance and value across the lines.",1
"Now Iâll turn to our music product. We sold 10.2 million iPods, which was down from 11 million in the year-ago quarter. There were two key reasons for this decline -- first, we reduced channel inventory by over 400,000. Second, sell-through declined by 4% year over year.",1
We are currently unable to make enough iPhone 3GSâ to meet robust demand and we are working to address this.,1
"I would like to discuss how we are looking at this market. We have three categories of what we call pocket products. Traditional MP3 players, iPod Touch, and iPhone. For traditional MP3 players, which includes Shuffle, Nano, and Classic, we saw a year-over-year decline which we internally had forecasted to occur. This is one of the original reasons we developed the iPhone and the iPod Touch. We expect our traditional MP3 players to decline over time as we cannibalize ourselves with the iPod Touch and the iPhone.",1
"However, we have a great business that we believe will last for many, many years and which we will continue to manage well and offer the worldâs most innovative products.",1
"Despite the decline in our sales, our research shows that about 50% of our recent traditional iPod purchasers are buying their first iPod, including those in our high market share countries such as the U.S., Japan, Australia, Canada, and the U.K.",1
"The iPod Touch did extremely well in the quarter, growing more than 130% year over year. Customers continue to embrace this outstanding platform experience, which has been increasingly enhanced by the tremendous offering for the App store.",1
"Our share of the U.S. market continues to be over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD and iPod was the top-selling MP3 player and continued to gain share year over year in nearly every country we track, based on the latest data published by GFK.",1
"I would now like to turn to the iPhone. We are thrilled to have sold over 5.2 million handsets in the June quarter, compared to 717,000 handsets sold in the year-ago quarter. Response to the new iPhone 3GS has been tremendous, with over 1 million 3GS handsets sold by the third day after its June 19th launch.",1
"Do you see this IP issue heating up later? How aggressive will you be in enforcing, for example, your multi-touch patent over what is obviously going to be globally a number of similar initiatives from other handset makers?",1
"We think that software is really the key ingredient for a great mobile experience, and we believe that we are many years ahead of the competition in this area. And so we welcome any competition, as long as it doesnât step on our IP.",1
Could you just touch on CapEx? It jumped quite a bit in the quarter. Could you talk about what the spending was on and is the target still $1.25 billion in the year?,1
Weâll hear from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.,1
Weâll hear from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.,1
Great. Thank you very much. Just a question about your go-forward gross margin target of 30% in fiscal â09. Obviously thatâs quite a bit lower than what youâve seen over the past couple of years and Iâm trying to understand if thatâs more about pricing or mix or what else is causing such a steep drop-off.,1
"David, as I said a few minutes ago, weâll delivering state-of-the-art products at price points that our competitors canât match, which has resulted in market share gains in each of our product areas, and we plan to continue this strategy into the future and deliver great value to customers.",1
"And as a result of that, I would see our gross margins being about 30% in fiscal 2009 and I canât get into you what we have in our new product pipeline if we donât talk about future products.",1
"I guess Iâm just trying to get a better handle on the fact that -- I mean, youâve always been delivering the same type of products at those price points, with gross margins a few hundred basis points higher than that. So whatâs the change?",1
"We have some investments in front of us that I canât discuss with you today where we are going to be delivering state-of-the-art new products that our competitors just arenât going to be able to match and as a result, I would see gross margins being about 30%, and thatâs all I can tell you at this point.",1
"I wanted to go back on the guidance issue for a second; over the last three years, Peter, youâve generally guided from June to September to have revenues up 3% and EPS varied a little bit but down [18.9%]. In reality, the results that youâve delivered have been order of magnitude -- and those are sequential changes -- revenue has been up 10% and EPS has been in fact not down but up 9%. In each of those periods in September, you typically have price downs or reduction in prices. You always have back-to-school transitions. The only difference I heard this quarter was a reversal of deferred at the contract manufacturer. So still trying to understand whatâs different this quarter in terms of how this is going to play out where in fact you are going to deliver September results that are above where youâve guided from and historically, thatâs exactly whatâs happened over the past three years. If you could comment on that, please.",1
"Okay, so why is the phone accounted differently than the iPod Touch?",1
"Sure. Keith, we gave you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving and we have a process we go through to evaluate what we think demand for our products will be and what we can make and what itâs going to cost us, and we give you guidance accordingly.",1
"I have guided revenue up this quarter on 5% from where we ended the June quarter. We are confident in our business. We believe we will sell more Macs in the September quarter than we did in the June quarter but we do see our gross margin being down, and Iâve told you the three reasons that I think are primarily going to drive that.",1
"Okay, well let me ask a follow-up then to Mr. Baileyâs question -- when you were describing why gross margins would be down to 30% in the out-quarters, I heard you mention price a couple of different times during your prepared and follow-on remarks. It sounds like what you are suggesting is in addition to mix though is price is going to be one of the things that you think leads the gross margins down, because in fact you havenât been to those gross margins in over eight quarters.",1
"Again, I canât talk about future products. That certainly could be the case and we also plan to continue to announce state-of-the-art products the deliver incredible value to our customers and we are very excited about what we have in our new product pipeline.",1
Okay. Iâll leave it there. Thank you.,1
Good afternoon. Maybe just a -- hello? Can you hear me?,1
"Because we are giving a way to current customers at no charge new software applications, an update to the software features when we make them available, and we are not doing that with iPods or Macs.",1
"Sure, Gene. We recognize revenue on all iPods when we ship them.",1
"Shannon, I think as I look back, I think the management team has made excellent decisions with our products and how weâve managed the business. With the guidance that weâve provided to you today, we expect our top line for fiscal â08 to be $32.4 billion, up 35% year over year from fiscal â07, which grew at -- which grew to $24 million. Weâre just getting started really with the iPhone. In the September quarter, we think weâre going to sell more than we ever have, so I think we run the business very, very well, plan to continue to do that in the future. Weâre investing in the business but weâve been providing leverage from an OpEx perspective for some period of time now and would hope to do that in the future as well.",1
"So I should be able to saw for it? Thank you. Thanks, Peter.",1
"Our capital expenditures in the June quarter were $304 million. We spent $113 million in our retail stores and $191 million outside of our retail stores, in our IT areas, facilities, and some of our manufacturing. And we do anticipate CapEx for fiscal â08 being $1.2 billion, about $400 million in retail and $800 million in the other parts of our business.",1
And then I wonder if I could just ask about Apple TV really quick and wondering if you can give us any clue or any indication on the number of video rentals or how the launch of that service has impacted hardware sales?,1
"We started shipping Apple TV, as you know, in February and weâve been pleased with the sales that weâve had. However, the Apple TV remains a hobby, as we call it, because itâs not -- this business is not nearly as large as the Macintosh business or the music business and does not have the potential of the iPhone business. However, we are very excited about the potential of it and continue to invest in it.",1
"From Needham, weâll hear from Charles Wolfe.",1
I have a quick question -- what was the division of iPod sales between the U.S. and international?,1
"Charlie, thatâs not something that we specifically break out but I can tell you that our iPod sales in the United States grew 10% and we grew 15% outside the United States.",1
"Thanks, Charlie. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"One final question -- can you remind us of the accounting on the iPod Touch, the accounting treatment?",1
Good afternoon. Obviously the iPhone is off to a good launch and seemed to be in line across the country and weâre down to 2% of your stores have iPhones. Can you give us any sort of expectations beyond youâre doing your best to refill the channel in terms of when we should expect to see a little bit broader inventory?,1
"The response to the new iPhone 3G has been stunning. As Peter said in his opening comments, we sold our 1 millionth iPhone just three days after the launch, and to contrast that, it took us 74 days to sell 1 million of the first generation iPhone and almost two years to sell our 1 millionth iPod, and so we are thrilled with what we see.",1
"As you say, there are a number of stock outs. This is a factor of the overwhelming demand. I am very pleased with the production ramp, very pleased with the trajectory of it. Weâre shipping units as fast as we can and obviously weâre trying to catch the demand and serve our customers.",1
"We are confident enough in the production ramp that we will be launching about 20 additional countries on August 22nd, which would bring our total to over 40, and we still expect to be selling the iPhone in over 70 countries later this calendar year.",1
Would you be launched in some of those other countries if you expected stock outage in the U.S.?,1
"You know, as I said, I like what Iâm seeing in the production ramp and I am confident in our ability to supply. Iâm not going to predict when supply will meet demand. Weâve been selling the phone for 10 days and so this is a very difficult thing to do with this level of data.",1
"Okay, good. Sorry, Iâm on an iPhone 3G, so I hope you can. Anyway, looking at the -- moving past the gross margin, maybe we can talk a little bit about operating profit or operating margin. You know, Peter, if you can give some idea of if you are focused on running the business for gross margin or actually for the gross profit dollars that fall off of it, therefore thereâs still substantial room for upside to EPS, even if gross margin gets compressed a bit.",1
"Okay, and then just one question, because obviously with the accounting on the iPhone, the cash is going to become substantially more important, so can you talk a little bit about use of cash, managementâs thoughts on cash, obviously given the relatively small return you are getting right now on your cash?",1
What key sustainable advantages do you feel that you will have in that kind of environment to sustain the kind of demand that youâve seen for iPhone and support the kind of plans that you are expecting for expansion?,1
"And then secondly, just in terms of the iPhone ramp, you mentioned that this was really a demand issue. Can you confirm that there have been no production or component issues to date? And if there havenât been, I guess the question is why wouldnât you push the launch date out one or two weeks so you wouldnât have created what appears to be widespread stock-outs, frustration among customers that they canât get it, et cetera? Was it just beyond the three standard deviation expectation for demand initially or -- so A, can you confirm that there hasnât been a production or component shortage issue to date? And then B, if that hasnât been the case, why wouldnât have business practice suggest that waiting to ramp capacity and launching in way that could have been more satisfying to more customers had been prudent?",1
"Great, and just one last follow-up, just on the App Store. Expectations here going forward, I know your iTunes has been generally run as break-even or better. Youâre getting a 30% split of the application revenue. Clearly this has done well over the -- just the initial launch. I just wanted to get your thoughts and your expectations as far as contributing to profits.",1
"Sure. Weâre thinking about the App Store in the same way that we think about the iTunes store. While it will generate some revenues, it will be a small profit generator, and just as with the iTunes store making iPods more attractive, we think the App Store will make the iPhone and iPod Touch more attractive to customers. Weâll hopefully see an indirect return by selling more iPhones and iPod Touches.",1
"Thanks, Jeff. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"Thank you. I have a few questions, please; firstly, can you comment at all, or do you care to comment on whatâs baked into your guidance around the health of the U.S. consumer? You are still doing phenomenally well in your stores but if we look sequentially, Mac units grew 67% last quarter; they grew 44% this quarter in your stores against a much easier compare. If we look at your store traffic, it was actually down sequentially from 33.7 million to 32. It looks like itâs typically up between Q2 and Q3. Do these indicators mean anything to you and do you have anything baked into your forecast for fiscal Q4 that incorporates a view about the health of the U.S. consumer?",1
"Toni, weâre going to leave economic commentary to others but we didnât see any obvious impact to the business in the June quarter, and I talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks just how we did at the company level but also in the U.S., in our retail stores with our iPods and our education unit, which had the best June quarter in our history.",1
Weâre certainly aware of the economic environment and weâve considered it among other factors in preparing our guidance.,1
"Toni, as I said before, the demand has been staggering almost in every country that weâve shipped in. And on the manufacturing ramp, it is right on schedule. Weâre very pleased with the trajectory of it and the confidence that that gives us to -- or it gives us the confidence to launch in 20 additional countries in August.",1
"And if you can talk about also the rollout into different geographies, it sounds like you are doing another 20 countries by August 22nd. Do you intend to do them in blocks or is it going to be more linear after that to get up to the 70 number?",1
I guess the question is why do you have such confidence that you can fulfill demand in 20 countries when you werenât able to fill demand in 22 countries at initial launch for more than two days?,1
"Iâm not predicting the demand. Demand is very difficult to predict with a new product of its sort, that has a new price point and itâs a revolutionary product. But we do have confidence over the supply and itâs the confidence over supply that allows us to continue to expand.",1
"And then the final question I had was just revisiting this gross margin commentary you made about going forward. My impression is that the iPhone is the significantly higher gross margin product than your overall business, and obviously thatâs going to ramp and all else being equal, should push up margins. I understand your commentary about â09, and you mentioned the word umbrella and you didnât want to create an umbrella, so I think the only inference is that you are going to be incrementally more aggressive on pricing on select products. But as we think about that over time, shouldnât the upward pressure on your gross margins later in â09 or beyond â09 be positive due to both the iPhone plus the scale economies that you had talked about?",1
"Toni, a couple of things; first of all, I wouldnât rule that in or out and Iâm not going to make comments beyond â09. As regards the iPhone, we donât discuss specific product margins. However, the iPhone is currently a small part of our total revenue and gross margin, as a result of subscription accounting. And with the introduction of the iPhone 3G and our authorizing carriers in over 70 countries, we expect to sell significantly more iPhones this quarter and in the future than we have and we are very happy with the margins in our new model.",1
"From RBC Capital Markets, weâll hear from Mike Abramsky.",1
"Thanks very much. I guess they say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Weâve seen that already with a number of iPhone knock-offs that are proliferating, about to proliferate. I would imagine that itâs going to be a very crowded fall season with a lot of choices for consumers, both in North America and outside, as they vie for similar kinds of user experiences that youâve been able to do.",1
"The August 22nd one is a block, as I indicated, and we would prefer to do more in blocks but weâll likely have some of each as the year goes on to close out the year greater than 70.",1
"Sure. We incur our OpEx in engineering, sales, and marketing related to the iPhone currently, while recognizing the revenue over -- and product costs over a two-year period of time. And we do have launch expenses for the iPhone 3G that are built into the September quarter and thatâs provided for in the $1.27 billion guidance that I gave you.",1
I donât have a change in our position to share with you today.,1
"On the iPhone, thereâs been a significant interest. As you know, about a third of the Fortune 500 were in our iPhone 2.0 Beta Program, and weâve got very large enterprises that, just to name a few, Kraft, First American, Disney, Genentech, Oracle, and the Southern Company who are all beginning to deploy iPhones within their organization. Also, there have been companies that are writing applications, and you can see some of these on the App Store, such as Salesforce.com with Salesforce Mobile and Oracle with Oracle Business Indicators, and there are many, many more enterprises that are writing custom apps for their particular enterprise. So we see significant excitement. Many of the carrier partners, as you probably know, have very large sales forces to call on these companies direct and they are very excited about pushing and evangelizing the iPhone in these accounts.",1
Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan.,1
"Thank you. Good afternoon. A few questions; Peter, I want to get back to David and Keithâs question regarding the commentary on margins going forward. Is it safe to say then you are kind of suggesting, without announcing your new products, that Apple could introduce a more flexible pricing structure across the product lines in terms of not having the reputation of being the high-priced configuration provider of old? And maybe being a lot more volume driven, particularly on the Mac side of the house?",1
"Again, I canât get in to what we will do in the future but as I look at our products today, I think we are incredibly well-priced from a competitive perspective. With the iPod, we start at $49 and go up to about $400, with many choices in between for customers, and I think we are as competitive today on the Mac as weâve even been in the 12 years that Iâve been with Apple, so Iâm very comfortable with our pricing.",1
"Okay, and then Tim, could you help us understand how we should think about the longer term trajectory of your retail footprint overseas over time? I think you said 10,300 storefronts, but where do you see that going by the end of this year and next?",1
"Thatâs obviously the channel numbers that, just to clarify for everyone, not our own retail store. I see it continuing to increase, because as we grow our market share, the Mac will need more coverage. It doesnât need the amount of coverage that iPod has, which has over 45,000, nor the amount that the phone will eventually have. But I do envision it continuing to grow.",1
"And then just lastly, I know itâs very early here with the 3G iPhone but there seems to be a lot of buzz within the corporate IT houses regarding the phone. Can you maybe give us the sense in terms of what level of discussion has been stirred so far in terms of folks that want to fold in not only the iPhone but maybe even Macs into the corporate environment?",1
Weâll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Peter, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the operating margin impact, maybe in the September quarter, from the iPhone launch. In other words, what cannot be deferred along with the handset revenues?",1
"Thanks. Peter, I understand this is a low base, but inventory did increase 50% sequentially, so is it fair to assume that that number normalized post the 3G launch?",1
"Katy, the increase in inventories related primarily to a buy ahead we did to -- largely related to the launch of the iPhone 3G.",1
"Okay, and then profits at Apple stores grew faster than revenue over the past few quarters. How are you thinking about continuing to flow that margin upside to the bottom line versus reinvesting in either store layout or resources to support what should be higher traffic, post the 3G phone launch?",1
"Well, to date, Ron has I think really done a -- and his team a wonderful job of giving customers a great experience in the store and traffic just continues to go up. Again, we were up over 10 million people year over year to 32 million in just 211 stores that were open on average.",1
"Weâre opening -- weâll open this year about 45 stores. Ron is remodeling some of the early stores that we opened to give customers a better experience, so we are making investments in the stores and he, with the revenue growth, has been able to provide some leverage, as you point out, along the way.",1
Weâll hear from Jeff Fidacaro with Merrill Lynch.,1
"Richard, my comment was regarding the June quarter within the $180 million that was hardware revenue only from iPhone and Apple TV, it did not include any accessory revenue or payments from AT&T.",1
We have a question now from Richard Farmer at Merrill Lynch.,1
"And third, we efficiently ramped our new products in the quarter, spending less than we had planned.",1
"We did ship some of the 270,000 iPhones to AT&T, and as they indicated, most of their stores were stocked out during the initial launch. However, there would have been some inventory in transit to AT&T at the end of the quarter.",1
"On the iPod side, we have close to 40,000 distribution points, which is up slightly from the previous quarter, as we have added a few select resellers around the world. On the Macintosh, we have about 7,000 points of sale. We are conducting some pilots to potentially expand that, but we are not making any announcements today about that.",1
"In terms of the promotion, we started back in the beginning of June, and so there were not a significant number of those within the quarter.",1
"Thanks, Harry. Could we have the next question please?",1
Weâll go next to Richard Farmer with Merrill Lynch.,1
"Thank you. Peter, I would like to ask a couple of questions on gross margins, please. In the past, you have commented, at least qualitatively, on the iPod hardware gross margin. I wonder if you can provide any color there on how much that might have changed sequentially and year over year.",1
The same question as it would relate to the Mac hardware in gross margin change.,1
"Finally, just a broader question on your philosophy in gross margin management longer-term. It seems like historically, you had been managing a little bit more to lower the prices or increase the feature set so that the gross margins were more stable, and that the upside in gross margins was quickly put back into price to stimulate growth. This quarter and some other recent data points, it seems like you are managing more for margin leverage. I understand the component cost had something to do with that, but if you look longer-term, are you making a decision here to manage the company more for margin leverage? Or should we think of you as investing a lot of that back into features and price so that the margin leverage we are seeing is more temporary?",1
"In terms of product gross margins, we have a long-standing practice of not releasing specific gross margins, specific product gross margins. However, the iPod gross margin was up sequentially in the June quarter and that was really attributable to the very favorable commodity environment. The Mac products precipitated in that too.",1
"Now, as regards our philosophy, I think that we are very competitive today, both on our Mac products and iPod. We will continue to be aggressive with both our pricing and our feature and function.",1
"From a long-term perspective, we are not putting out a financial model, but I would target gross margin generally in the 27 to 28 some range. I've discussed with you in the past the factors that add and subtract to that. The primary positive factors include direct sales, where we retain the channel margin, as well as software and AppleCare and accessories. The primary adverse factors to gross margin are hardware, including iPod.",1
"Thanks, Richard. Could we have the next question please?",1
Weâll go next to Richard Gardner with Citigroup.,1
"Thank you. Just two quick questions. First of all, Tim, I was hoping you might be able to give us a sense of supply/demand balance on the MacBook exiting the quarter.",1
"Secondly, also for Tim, does the fact that Intel rolls out new chips and drops prices more frequently than your prior processor partners create additional challenges for you on the inventory management front? Will you be rolling your products more frequently and adjusting your prices more frequently as the bill of materials comes down? Or will you do it the same way that you have done historically, which is adjust your prices at the time of new product introduction? Thank you.",1
"In regards to the MacBook, we shipped a significant number of MacBooks, particularly in the month of June. However, despite that, we did exit the quarter with some backlog. We are working very hard to fulfill that backlog during this quarter. For the full quarter, I do not envision having a supply issue that would negate that.",1
"Peter, last thing on the housekeeping side of the equation, can you maybe give us a sense of how many distribution points you have for both the iPod and the Mac? Also, a rough sense as to how many of the Macs sold in the quarter were tied to the iPod promotion? Thank you.",1
"The average store sales were down slightly year over year, but our total revenue from the stores is up about 29%. The average store revenue was down, a result of iPod sales being relatively flat year over year, as we have had a greatly-expanded channel, but our Mac sales continue to increase and we are up 50% year over year.",1
"Traffic through the stores has just been phenomenal. We had over 17 million people come through the stores this past quarter. As I said in my prepared remarks, our Fifth Avenue store has seen over 500,000 people since it has been open in May.",1
"Sure. Our guidance for the September quarter actually is consistent with our past seasonality. Our range represents growth of 22% to 25% over last year. Again, last year, the last year September quarter was the best Mac sales quarter we had in education in 10 years.",1
"We had much more availability of our Intel-based Macs, yes. As we said in the last call in the March quarter, Ron really began to focus from January at Macworld on the Intel transition and we did not have products in January, in particular. With our having availability, not only of the MacBook Pro and Intel-based Mac but now the MacBook, he had just a fantastic quarter in the stores, not only with Mac sales but just sales in general.",1
"Peter, you mentioned what the average revenue was per store for the average store opened. Could you refresh us on what that was last quarter? Thanks.",1
I will have to follow up with you. I do not recall what last quarter was.,1
"Thanks, Keith. Could we have the next question please?",1
Weâll go next to Robert Semple with Credit Suisse.,1
"Can you walk me through the revenue outlook? If you take the midpoint of it, I know it is similar to what you did last year, but last year you guys were taking down inventories on the iPod side, for I guess both the Nano and the eventual video launch. Historically, you have been up a little bit more seasonally than that in September. Can you just kind of walk me through the thought process there?",1
"Then just switching gears to iPod. I noticed ASP was off about $15 sequentially. Is that more of a mix issue, or was it because you started the kind of back-to-school free iPod with the Mac a little bit earlier than you did last year?",1
"In terms of the retail performance, if I look at revenue per walk-in customer and revenue per store, I am looking at revenue per walk-in customer is down for the sixth consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis. I am wondering if you have a sense as to why that might be. Also, on the same-store sales, we are also seeing that down year over year the last two quarters.",1
"The main thing that drove that was the introduction in Q2 of the 1-gigabyte Nano for $149, and so in Q3 we had a full quarter at that.",1
"Thanks, Rob. Could we have the next question please?",1
"Weâll go next to Harry Blount, Lehman Brothers.",1
"Peter, just in terms of Leopard, are you assuming any contribution from Leopard in the September quarter for the margins?",1
I am sorry -- for the September quarter?,1
"We have not announced the ship dates for Leopard. Our Developers Conference begins on August 7 next month, and we look forward to talking about Leopard and showing you many of the new features.",1
"In terms of Intel, we are very pleased to be working with Intel. They have been a great partner for us. We feel that they have the best processor by far for us to use in the products that we both want to make and are currently shipping. Frankly, I am pleased that there are new products coming out there and that we can change over time.",1
"As you know, we do not discuss unannounced products, so I really would not want to go into our philosophy about when we would roll with them and how we might change pricing.",1
Weâll go next to Bill Fearnley with FTN Midwest Securities.,1
"The other thing that was happening was that the e-Mac was really at a close to an end-of-life last quarter, so sales on that were not as robust as they were a year ago.",1
"Perfect, thanks so much.",1
"Thanks, Rebecca. Could we have the next question please?",1
Weâll go next to Jonathan Hoopes with ThinkEquity.,1
"Thank you. Looking at the unit shipment levels between the Mac desktops and the notebooks, are we to understand then that the vergence was mainly a function of the pro community not having products there to upgrade into, or was it a function of the education? As we move forward into the September education period, do you expect desktops to regain some strength there?",1
"The main thing affecting desktops, frankly, are the compelling notebooks that we announced. So as the market is moving more notebook, Apple is leading the way and with the incredible announcement that we had with the MacBook Pro in Q2 and then the MacBook in Q3, there was just a very compelling reason to buy a laptop.",1
"On the desktop side, the comparison there would be, on a pro business, is fairly slower than a year ago, as people await a PowerMac with an Intel chip and/or an application from a third-party developer.",1
"Thank you. Do you have an idea as to how long a pro user typically waits before they upgrade? Are they more of a wait-and-see, or do you believe you had a wait list for pro users on an intel refresh?",1
I know that is subjective.,1
"I believe that pro users act like other users, and there is a time-standard deviation between different types of segments with them. I would not want to estimate what the average it is, or would be.",1
"Thanks, Jonathan. Could we have the next question please?",1
Weâll go next to Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.,1
"Thank you. Just a follow-up on the last question, is there any way you could provide a percentage of desktops to the pro market, both in the June quarter of â06 and compare that to the June quarter of â05, just so we can get a feel as to the size of that market?",1
"Secondly, is there any way you could quantify the missed sales due to supply constraints on the MacBook business? Thank you.",1
"On the size of the market, we do not disclose size of market numbers. Frankly, it is very hard to conclude exactly what they are because we sell both directly and indirectly, so that would be very hard to do.",1
"â¦to evaluate. The software sales are the best at the front end of a release, and over time they are still good. Our OS sales even in the June quarter were good, but they are not what they are in the first quarter of launch.",1
"Well, that is really hard toâ¦",1
Just a follow-up question on the iPod units -- what was the effect of the major and Mac promo being moved up in June? Was that significant to contributing to the iPod units for the quarter?,1
"Good afternoon, two questions, first on retail distribution. Can you just confirm what pilots you are currently running and have underway and when approximately they began? I have a quick follow-up.",1
It was not significant.,1
"Then on the iPod ASPs, how should we be thinking about the blended ASPs going forward for the category? Should we be thinking that they should stay within the range that they have been the last few quarters?",1
"Bill, I am sorry. That is a question we cannot answer. We do not provide product level forecast.",1
"Okay. On the direct versus indirect mix, could you give additional color on that as well? Thatâs it, thanks.",1
"Sure. In the quarter, our direct sales, which we define as sales through our retail stores, online stores directly to customers and the iTunes Music Store, were 50% in the June quarter, up from 44% in the March quarter.",1
Weâll go next to Rebecca Runkle with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Rebecca, the main one that we are running right now is with BestBuy. We are in a few of their stores, half of which have Apple people selling product and half of which do not. We are working with BestBuy to evaluate those results. We have been doing that for about two months.",1
"Just to clarify, in the quarter before historical releases, did you typically see any slowdown in CPU sales in anticipation of the new OS?",1
Nothing else currently underway?,1
Not with a major partner. We have some select things that are of a smaller nature.,1
"Perfect. Then, Peter, if we were to go back and look at historical OS launches, will you give us some color in terms of the impact and trending that you saw in the business, perhaps look at it, the quarter before an OS release, what types of variations did you see in the business as a result? Then, during the quarter of the OS release, what types of trends did you see?",1
You mean for the OS sales itself?,1
"Just in terms of how the OS has trended, but then also how it has impacted the overall business. I am trying to get to, holistically, how we should be thinking about historical OS releases and how they have impacted the business model, broadly speaking.",1
"Okay. First of all, when we released Tiger in the June quarter a year ago, our revenues from Tiger in that quarter from shrink wrap and license sales, so not including any allocation for what would have been on a Mac, was $100 million in the quarter. Your first-quarter sales are always your best. We certainly think that Mac OS X is the best operating system. I think it is a part of, along with our design, our transition to Intel, our retail stores and other great channel partners, are why the Mac has been growing so well and we have been gaining share.",1
"Peter, just to be clear, was most of that delta, if you will, between the March quarter and the June quarter of units up 50% this quarter in total at retail, versus 7 last quarter? Was that disproportionately driven by the new Mac notebooks?",1
"Yes, units, Keith, for Macs in retail were up 40% year over year. The response in the stores to both the MacBook and MacBook Pro was very, very strong. As I indicated, about half the Macs we sold were to people that had never owned a Mac before.",1
"Thank you. I have a question on the retail side. There was some volatility between this quarter and last quarter in terms of both the units and revenues. I was just hoping you could speak to that a little bit, and I have a follow-up. Thanks.",1
"The MacBook, which we introduced in mid-May, has been extremely well-received and, coupled with our very popular MacBook Pro, has contributed to Apple's increased unit market share of portables in U.S. retail from 6% in January to 12% in June, according to NPD.",1
"Operating margin for the quarter was 13% and net income was $472 million, or $0.54 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Excluding the impacts of $37 million in non-cash, stock-based compensation expense, operating margin was 13.8%, net income was $499 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.57.",1
"The quarter's robust operating margin was attributable to the revenue growth, a very favorable component environment and solid expense management.",1
"I would like to first talk about our Mac products, which represented 55% of our total quarterly revenue. Mac product revenue increased 11% year over year, fueled by Mac unit shipment growth of 12% year over year, to $1.327 million. Ending channel inventory was within our target range of four to five weeks.",1
"We continue to be very happy with our progress and our developers' progress in the transition to Intel. We have now introduced the iMac, MacBook, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini with Intel processors. We are solidly on track to transition the Power Mac and Xserve by the end of this calendar year.",1
"We have released universal versions of Apple's consumer and professional software applications and our third-party developers have released over 2,900 universal applications. We expect that over 70% of the 500 applications we consider most critical to our customers will be available in universal versions by the end of September.",1
"We have been very pleased with the response to our new Macs, particularly from our consumer and education customers. Intel-based Macs accounted for over 75% of the quarter's Mac shipments.",1
"We are also very happy with our Mac ad campaign and feel it is contributing to our momentum, particularly with consumers.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the second-highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple's history.",1
"We believe that many of our creative professional customers have delayed purchases as they await new Intel-based Mac desktops, universal applications, or both.",1
"Our music products posted another quarter of strong results, representing 45% of total company revenue and increasing 45% year-over-year. iPod shipments grew 32% year over year, consistent with our expectations, and we exited the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.",1
"We continue to be very enthusiastic about iPod. Based on the latest data published by NPD, iPod accounts for over 75% of the U.S. market for MP3 players. iPod is also the top-selling MP3 player in many large markets, such as Canada, Australia, the U.K., France, Spain, Italy and Japan, according to the latest data published from NPD, GFK and BCN.",1
"Other music product revenue was $457 million, up 90% year over year. These results were a function of continued strong sales from the iTunes Music Store and very solid performance for iPod accessories.",1
"The iTunes Music Store continues to lead the industry, accounting for 85% share of the market for legally purchased and downloaded music in the U.S., based on the latest data available from Nielsen SoundScan. We have continued to enhance and expand the iTunes Music Store, now offering over 3 million songs, 9,000 music videos and over 150 television programs to the U.S. market.",1
"We are investing heavily in iPod and iTunes engineering and are very enthusiastic about our products in the pipeline. The iPod ecosystem continues to thrive with innovative new products, such as the Nike + iPod Sport Kit, which allows runners to get real-time feedback on their performance through their iPod Nanos.",1
"The quarter's revenue was $4.37 billion, representing 24% year-over-year growth. The strong revenue was fueled by the best Mac unit sales in any 13-week quarter in Apple's history and continued healthy demand for our music products.",1
"Please also note that any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's call should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, Apple's GAAP results. A reconciliation of any GAAP and non-GAAP measures discussed is posted on Apple's website at www.apple.com/investor.",1
"We opened 14 stores during the quarter, ending with 155. With an average of 146 stores open during the quarter, average quarterly revenue per store was $4.9 million.",1
"So Ben on the services side, of course, the vast majority of what we do in services is to final consumers. We do understand and appreciate the fact that the enterprise is a great opportunity for us. Very recently, for example, we launched this new subscription service here in the United States which we call Apple Business Essentials where essentially we provide support to small and medium-sized businesses in terms of 24/7 support device management for small business owners which we think small companies will value and appreciate. Obviously, we sell Apple Care to enterprises already today. But we know enterprise in general as a market is a very interesting market for us and we're putting a lot of effort and focus on it and we believe we have really good opportunities to grow.",1
"Hi, thanks very much for the question. This one is regarding Mac. Great quarter with the results by the way, some exciting products coming out for sure. We're noticing that there's the lead times are longer for Mac's now ordered today with some available now but many not shipping until June. Just wanted to get your insight on how much of that you think is driven by the strong March results with the product launch and likely sellout conditions versus just real tightness in the supply chain? And the obvious follow-on to that is when do you expect you might catch up and get Mac lead times back within a week?",1
"Well, we're working hard. We've got lots of customers that we want to get the new Macs too. And so we're working hard on them. They are a result of the combination of the COVID disruptions and the silicon shortage that we've talked about before. And when we might remedy that, I don't -- we're not really forecasting when we can be out of the silicon shortage, so that would be a difficult answer. I think the COVID piece of it I hope is a transitory kind of issue. And so I would hope that it would get better over time.",1
Great. Thanks Kyle. Can we have the next question please?,1
Thank you. Weâll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.,1
"Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is on services. Luca, I was hoping you could share a little bit of perspective on maybe how much of the services contribution is purely consumer versus enterprise? And how you think about the longer term opportunity to monetize the enterprise community?",1
"And then Tim for you as a follow-up, I think Jim Suva had asked a question earlier about some of your strategy. I was curious how strategy might have evolved since everything has been going on, what changes you might have seen as of late with respect to freight and some of the geographic production footprint? And any evolution that has happened as of late? Thank you.",1
"Ben, you brought up freight. Freight is a huge challenge in today both from an inflationary point of view and from an availability point of view. And so right now the focus is on moving the freight to customers any way that we can do that. Over time, we'll do that much more efficiently.",1
"Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today may consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, earnings per share, future products, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and a special committee investigation relating to the company's past stock option grants. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2005, the Form 10-Q for the first and second fiscal quarters of 2006, and our Form 8-K filed with the SEC today.",1
And I would hope that the fundamental rates reset some both -- and I'm talking about both ocean and air. And so both of them have come under some significant inflationary pressure partly due to COVID and some other reasons as well I would guess.,1
"And in terms of geo production we are constantly making tweaks here and there. And I don't want to go into the details of those because we view it as to be sensitive kind of information, but we're constantly making moves to optimize in the current environment.",1
Thank you both.,1
"Thank you, Ben. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcast as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. The numbers for the telephone replay are in 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. Please enter confirmation code 1807633. These replays will be available by approximately 5 P.M. Pacific Time today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Josh Rosenstock at 408-862-1142. Financial analysts can contact me with additional questions at 669-227-2402. Thank you again for joining us.",1
"Good day, and welcome to this Apple Computer third quarter financial results conference call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer. He will be joined by Apple's COO, Tim Cook, and Apple Treasurer, Gary Whistler for the Q-and-A session with analysts.",1
"It was another exciting quarter for the Apple retail stores. Fueled by very strong sales of MacBooks and MacBook Pros, the retail stores generated revenue of $715 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth. The stores generated $29 million in segment profit, excluding $148 million in associated manufacturing profit.",1
"Store traffic continued to be very strong, with over 17 million customers visiting our stores during the quarter. Based on the latest retail store survey, nearly 50% of customers buying Macs in our stores are new to the Mac.",1
Weâll go next to Keith Bachman with Banc of America.,1
"We had a very fabulous consumer and higher education market season. We believe that we are very well-poised going into the back-to-school season, with the MacBook being so well-received and also the promotion that we are running with the Nano. Gary?",1
"In terms of the quarter that we are now in, Q4, and this is included in the guidance that Peter gave earlier, we expect that we will continue to have a favorable environment on NAND Flash, on flat-panel displays, on portable hard-drives, all of which -- those areas are places where supply exceeds demand, as in the broader industry. On the DRAM market, we expect it to be relatively balanced and for the prices to trade within a fairly narrow range.",1
Weâll go next to Ben Reitzes with UBS.,1
"Thank you. Could you talk, Peter and maybe Tim, about the economic environment, consumer versus education in particular? Maybe give us a view of what you are seeing out there in the economy, given some of the worries out there.",1
"We will let Tim talk a little bit about some of our markets, and Gary then will give you a few thoughts on the economy.",1
"In terms of what we saw across the quarter, once we announced the MacBook and began shipping it, we saw a very robust consumer and higher education demand. In the pro markets, we were slow and we were slow because we believe that customers are delaying purchases, waiting on a PowerMac with an Intel chip in it, and in some cases waiting for applications, such as Adobe's Creative Suite.",1
"The ed. market had a fabulous quarter. It was the best June quarter in 10 years, as Peter said earlier. We grew 11% year over year in the ed. market versus an IDC projection of the ed. market, which was shrinking by 4%. The higher ed. market, which is a subset of total ed. market, grew 31% year over year.",1
Gary Whistler,1
"We expect the gross margin percent to decline sequentially, largely driven by a full quarter of the back-to-school promotion, lower international pricing from our June price reductions, and a different product mix, including more MacBooks, from the full quarter of availability.",1
"I am going to speak a little bit more generally. From the data we have seen, the U.S. economy and the consumer are holding up pretty well in the face of all this stuff, the geopolitical uncertainty and the higher oil prices and energy prices and higher interest rates. That said, and most of you are aware fed Chairman Bernanke made a few comments this morning suggesting or intimating the economy and consumer was beginning to moderate a little.",1
"I guess based on Tim's comments, you might not be seeing that yet. Just one last thing is, you came in above at least my expectations for iPods and Macs, but not in some of the other things, like other music, perhipherals and other. Granted the year-over-yearâs were decent on some of those, but was there anything holding those back? Was there anything in particular going on in other music or peripherals? I would have thought with more Mac sales that line might have done a little better sequentially. It looks like the quarter could have even been even more impressive, because I think the iPod/Macs overall were pretty good. Could you just comment there?",1
"On the software side, the comparison there is to the launch quarter of Tiger a year ago, so it is very, very difficult to compare. Sequentially, we had iLife announced in Q2.",1
"On the peripherals and other hardware category, we have integrated more and more things that were in peripherals before into the Macintosh itself and shipped it as part of the base configuration.",1
"The other music related products and services piece, basically a 6% decline sequentially, tracked to the iPod itself.",1
"Thanks, Ben. Could we have the next question please?",1
"As Peter said earlier, the component pricing was very favorable in Q3. It was favorable across almost all categories. It was a great time to be a buyer.",1
"I will start generally, and Tim can provide some further color on the commodity environment. We expect the favorable commodity environment to continue, and have guided our non-GAAP gross margins at 28.5%, which is above our historical target range.",1
"One of the highlights of the quarter was the opening of our Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan. The store has quickly become our highest volume store, and we recently welcomed the store's 500,000th visitor. Customers are visiting the store in record numbers around the clock.",1
"We had very strong cash generation during the quarter, increasing our cash balance by $950 million, to end with about $9.2 billion. This was primarily a function of cash flow from operations of just over $1 billion.",1
"We were very pleased with our education business results, generating the highest quarterly revenue through our U.S. education channel in over 10 years, and shipping more Macs than in any other June quarter in the company's history. Our higher education customers have been extremely receptive of the MacBook and MacBook Pro, and our back-to-school promotion has already proven very popular with customers.",1
"In terms of geographic results, including sales from our retail stores, quarterly revenue in the Americas, Europe and Japan was up 27%, 22% and 13% respectively. Gross margin was 30.3% on a GAAP basis, about 190 basis points higher than our guidance, primarily due to a very favorable component pricing environment, and secondarily due to a more favorable mix of direct Mac sales.",1
"Included in GAAP cost of goods sold was $6 million in stock-based compensation expense. Excluding that expense, non-GAAP gross margin was 30.4%.",1
"GAAP operating expenses were $759 million, including $31 million in expense related to stock-based compensation.",1
"OI&E was $95 million, about $10 million higher than guidance, primarily due to higher-than-expected cash balances and higher-than-expected yields on cash investment.",1
"The tax rate for the quarter was just under 29%. This differed from our previous tax rate guidance of about 32%, primarily due to a tax benefit reported for the implementation of tax planning strategy associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act that more than offset a tax charge reported for the repatriation. This resulted in a net benefit in the quarter of $24 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.",1
"For the quarter, we are targeting revenue between $4.5 billion and $4.6 billion. We expect the total quarterly cost of non-cash, stock-based compensation to be approximately $40 million. We expect GAAP gross margins to be about 28.4%, reflecting approximately $6 million related to stock-based compensation expense. Without that expense, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 28.5%. We expect GAAP op-ex to be about $785 million, including about $34 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect non-GAAP op-ex to be about $751 million. We expect OI&E to be about $100 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 32%. We expect to generate GAAP EPS of about $0.46 to $0.48, which includes an anticipated $0.03 per share related to non-cash, share-based compensation expense. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be about $0.49 to $0.51.",1
"Good afternoon. Just a question on your gross margin guidance and how you are going to position -- well, you cannot talk about that, so let's talk about gross margin guidance. It looks like there is a substantial decrease quarter over quarter relative to where you came in. Are we to assume more price aggressiveness and mix shift on the product side is driving that, or do you anticipate a big change in the commodity market environment? Also, if you can just talk about what you are seeing in commodities in general.",1
"We are thrilled to have just reported the second-highest revenue and earnings in Apple's history and are very pleased with our Intel transition progress. We are also very excited about and confident in the products in our pipeline. With that, I would like to open the call to questions.",1
We will go first to Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns.,1
"If you could talk, to the extent you can, about how you are viewing the balance of the year. In the press release, you talk about an exciting new pipeline of iPod products. There is a lot of concern, obviously, out there about what sort of plans you have. How important is it for you to hit the holiday season? Is that in your expectations as you look out at the balance of the year? How innovative can innovative be?",1
"Andy, you know that we do not talk about unannounced products, so there is really a limit to what I can say. I will just tell you two things. The first is, we are very confident in the products in our pipeline and I just do not imagine that the creativity at Apple could ever be low.",1
"Thanks, Andy. Could we have the next question please?",1
Weâll go next to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
What was your second question?,1
"Hoping to get a quantification of the notebook upside missed due to supply constraints, on the size of the backlog.",1
"We did ship a significant amount in June. We left with some backlog, but we are continuing to ship, obviously in this month and view that that will not be an issue for the quarter.",1
"It wonât be easy to build the third business because the competitors are large and entrenched and it will not be done overnight. Our perspective is measured in years not months, but the rewards, we believe, are huge for Apple. Apple clearly has the skills including world-class hardware and software engineering that make us confident that we can succeed.",1
(Operator Instructions) First up today is Ben Reitzes with UBS.,1
"Peter, with regard to guidance, you just guided $0.66 and came up with $0.92. Why should we believe that this is $0.65 this time when you have been so conservative? Are you really that worried about the component costs, or is there something else going on with regard to an upcoming price cut for a product?",1
"Ben, we gave you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving. Regarding the gross margin, I have guided it down to 29.5% as a result primarily of three factors. Weâre going to run the back-to-school promotion for most of the quarter, a great promotion for the company and brings us each year many new customers, but it is an expensive one. We do expect to see higher commodity costs and I will let Tim comment on that in a moment; and we have some product transitions that I canât get into.",1
"Well, I am sure someone will ask the component question. Can you give us any more flavor on the iPhones, perhaps how many have been sold to date? What do you think of various reports and chatter out there? This is a new frontier for us as analysts and weâre trying to navigate all the headwinds and tailwinds. Can you give us any more commentary as to what you think demand is like right now as you see it and how it should build into year end and how we fight this battle as investors and trying to match the hype?",1
"Let me take this one. As Peter said in his opening comments, we sold 270,000 units in the first 30 hours. AT&T said that more iPhones were sold in the first weekend than they have sold in the first month of any other wireless device in their entire history. More important than this, customers love their iPhones. As Peter mentioned in this opening comments, with a recent survey finding that a stunning 90% of iPhone owners were extremely or very satisfied with the iPhone.",1
"So our view is the starting gun has been fired and we have gotten off to a great start. However, our primary focus is not on initial sales. We are focused on building a third great business for Apple over the long term, alongside our Mac and iPod businesses, both of which you can see from the results reported today are doing very well.",1
"As Peter mentioned earlier, our next step is to begin selling the iPhone in Europe next quarter starting with a few major countries and then expand over the whole of 2008. We hope to, as a result of this and other things, we hope to grow our sales step by step, year by year and model my model, just like we have done in the prior product lines.",1
"We expect OpEx to be about $990 million, including about $59 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $165 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 32%. We expect to generate EPS of about $0.65, including an anticipated $0.05 per share related to non-cash stock-based compensation expense.",1
I do think itâs interesting to note that it took Apple seven quarters -- almost two years -- to sell our one millionth iPod. We hope to sell our one millionth iPhone in the first full quarter of sale. What we have seen so far gives us a lot of confidence to reiterate our goal to sell 10 million units across 2008.,1
"Do you see any shortages out there for components for the iPhone, and then I will cede the floor, here.",1
"Ben today, almost all AT&T stores and Apple retail stores have the iPhone in stock. We are shipping units off of Apple.com in one to two days. We have obviously included our view of longer-term supply and demand in our projections.",1
Next up we have a question from Shannon Cross - Cross Research.,1
Peter you had discussed in your remarks no payment from AT&T this quarter. Is there anything you can give us to clarify that comment and why there wouldnât be any in this quarter versus coming in next quarter?,1
"Shannon, I really canât go beyond it. We are not discussing the terms of the agreement but again, we will recognize payments from AT&T as revenue over time as earned. We did not recognize any revenue related to the payments from AT&T during the June quarter but will begin to do so in the September quarter.",1
"In closing, we're very pleased with the results of the June quarter. Quarterly Mac shipments broke the previous company record by more than 150,000 systems and we feel very positive about our momentum heading into the back-to-school season. We're off to a great start with the iPhone and are continuing to invest in the business for long-term growth in revenue and earnings.",1
"For the quarter, we are targeting revenue of about $5.7 billion. We expect the total quarterly cost of non-cash stock-based compensation to be approximately $69 million. We expect gross margin to be about 29.5%, reflecting approximately $10 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We are guiding gross margin down sequentially as a result of the back-to-school promotion, higher commodity costs, and product transitions.",1
You mean in terms of youâre trying to get the ASP? What do you mean ?,1
"Now let's discuss our retail stores results for the quarter, which were outstanding. Based on the accounting I just discussed, sales were $915 million, representing 33% year-over-year growth. The stores generated $184 million in segment margin compared to $122 million in the year ago quarter.",1
"As we also discussed previously, we are using subscription accounting to recognize revenue from Apple TV sales. Total deferred revenue related to iPhone and Apple TV sales was $180 million at the end of the June quarter, as shown in the schedule included with today's earnings press release.",1
"I'd like to now turn to the Apple retail stores. The stores offer customers a great experience for buying Macs, iPods and now iPhones. As we contemplate iPhone sales through our stores that will result in significant amounts of deferred revenue and cost of goods sold, we revisited how we measure our store's performance.",1
"Since the store's inception, operating income for our retail segment reflected cost of sales for Apple products at amounts normally charged for the same products to Apple's major U.S. channel partners operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs and incentives provided to those partners. We believe this enabled us to measure the store's performance in a way that would allow comparability to the performance of those resellers.",1
"Today, with more than six years of retail operating history and given the subscription accounting for the iPhone, we have determined that it is the right time to begin measuring our retail segment's operating performance in a manner that is generally consistent with the way we measure Apple's other operating segments.",1
"Therefore, beginning with the June quarter, we are using cost of sales for Apple's products sold through our retail stores that are similar to those used for Apple's other operating segments.",1
"We are also changing the way we measure AppleCare and .Mac sales through our retail stores. Historically, revenue and cost of sales were recognized by the retail segment at the time of the sale for AppleCare and .Mac. We are now recognizing revenue and cost for these products over the lives of their respective agreements, consistent with the accounting treatment in our other segments. We believe all these changes will allow greater comparability of results between our various operating segments.",1
"We remodeled 15 stores and opened eight new stores during the quarter, ending with 185 stores. With an average of 180 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $5.1 million compared to $4.7 million in the year-ago quarter.",1
"Looking ahead to the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"The stores sold 330,000 Macs during the quarter, representing 53% year-over-year growth. Once again, over 50% of the customers buying Macs in our stores during the quarter were new to the Mac.",1
"Approximately 21.9 million people visited our stores during the quarter, representing over 9,000 customers per store per week. The stores launched our new one-to-one initiative during the quarter and we now have over 270,000 members in this program.",1
"It was also a great quarter for Apple's U.S. education channel, which set a new all-time record for quarterly Mac sales. Our education one-to-one and new account initiatives help drive significant growth during the quarter, with MacBook sales particularly strong in both K to 12 and high-end markets.",1
"Total company gross margin was 36.9%, higher than our guidance, primarily due to favorable commodity costs, a different product pricing environment from what we expected, a more favorable product mix, and a greater mix of direct sales.",1
Operating expenses were $954 million including $55 million in stock-based compensation expense. We capitalized $26 million of software development expense during the quarter.,1
"OI&E was $155 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 32%. We had strong cash generation during the quarter, increasing our cash balance to end with over $13.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was over $1.2 billion.",1
"Looking at what you provided us on the deferred revenue and as Ben said, we are all starting to try to work through this, is it fair to take the $180 million of deferred revenue, both short and long term that is on your books, give it some haircut for Apple TV; divide by 270,000 units and come up with a per unit contribution? I hate doing this on a call, but...",1
"Well I was trying to figure out if there was anything in there other than just the ASP that is running through that line, or is that pretty much all weâre seeing right now?",1
"As we discussed previously, we plan to build on today's tremendous iPhone foundation by incorporating new software features and applications into the iPhone over time at no charge to customers. As a result, we have adopted subscription accounting for the iPhone handset sales and are recognizing the associated revenue and cost of goods sold over 24 months.",1
"I will ask the component question, Tim. I was just hoping maybe you could give us a sense of what was better than expected in the second quarter and how you see component prices trending for the categories in the third quarter?",1
No.,1
"Okay. And then in your gross margin commentary, you said that was different pricing in the quarter than you expected, is that right? If you could give a little more clarification on that?",1
"Sure, we experienced a more stable pricing environment for some of our hardware products than we had provided for in the guidance. That was a positive, and we also saw a more favorable product mix, which to some degree went hand-in-hand with the higher direct sales when we sell, particularly on the online stores and in the retail stores, we tend to see a better product mix across the product line.",1
Your next question comes from Richard Gardner - Citigroup.,1
"Tim, could you give us an update on the Best Buy roll out and how thatâs coming? How many stores you were in at the beginning of the quarter and how many stores exiting the quarter and whether that was a material contributor to the Mac unit shipment number in the quarter?",1
"Richard at the beginning of the quarter we were around 50, by the end of the quarter we were around 75. By the end of this quarter we will be over 200 and we expect to be almost at 300 by the end of the calendar year. So itâs going very well, both parties are very happy about it and thatâs the reason we are expanding.",1
"Yes, sure. Component prices, particularly DRAM which bottomed in the quarter later than we predicted and lower than we predicted, both of those led component prices in general to be more favorable than we predicted and this contributed to the higher than expected gross margins that Peter has talked about.",1
"David, we donât discuss the terms of various agreements that we have with vendors and suppliers. I am sorry, we canât answer that question.",1
"In terms of going forward, as you know historically in the second half of the year, the commodity markets tighten as the industry heads into a seasonally stronger demand period, and I donât envision this year being fundamentally different.",1
"Specifically, we see the NAND flash market tightening, we expect DRAM to stabilize from its recent over supply state; and on LCDs, a fundamental lack of new capacity investment combined with flat-panel TV demand is creating a greater than typical imbalance between supply and demand. For other commodities, we expect them to follow more historic trends.",1
"Tim, if I could follow up. Did pre-buys or forward purchases on NAND during the first calendar quarter contribute meaningfully to the gross margin upside in the second quarter?",1
"Rich, I donât want to go into that level of detail.",1
Your next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein.,1
"Can you comment on whether your 270,000 iPhone shipments include shipments to the channel? That being AT&T stores. If so, how many iPhones were in inventory at the end of the quarter?",1
So you canât even answer if you are or if you are not?,1
"Good afternoon. In addition to the payments that youâre getting from AT&T, are you receiving any fees from the other vendors that have placement for their services on the main screen of the iPhone?",1
"Shannon, for both the current and the long-term deferred revenue it is just the hardware revenue for both iPhone and Apple TV. So there arenât accessories or anything else that is in there.",1
"I know you talked a little bit about the AT&T relationship and the accounting on that. Peter, is there any sort of just very big picture thoughts you can give us on how to model that revenue share between Apple and AT&T?",1
Finally just given the fact that obviously cash was $1.2 billion this quarter and cash is going to become so important now that we are all looking at the deferred part of the business and how you are running it. Have you given any thought to providing cash flow guidance per share?,1
Not on this call. We are going to continue to report to you in each of our calls what our cash flow from operations was. We have traditionally not forecasted or provided any guidance on balance sheet items and I am not sure I see that changing.,1
"Just on the gross margin side, I know Ben asked about it, but looking back historically there has been sort of 100 to 200 basis points decrease from the June quarter to September quarter and obviously you are forecasting a much bigger one; and you have had basically the iPod promotion in place for last couple of quarters. Is there anything in there we should really focus on in terms of a change from the prior years that would lead you to go down to 29.5% gross margin?",1
"I am not really sure, Shannon, that prior year comparisons are a great way to always look at gross margins. We tend to think about them and I talk to you about them on the call on a more sequential basis.",1
"In terms of the back-to-school promotion, we began the promotion in about the middle of June so we had a couple of weeks of it in the June quarter. But weâre going to see it pretty much the whole way through the September quarter. That, along with the commodity cost prices going up that weâre seeing and some product transitions that I canât get into are the primary drivers of the sequential decrease in the gross margin that I have guided to.",1
From Piper Jaffray is Gene Munster.,1
"Gene, I am sorry. I just am not in a position at this point to go into it really in more detail. Again we did not record any revenue from the June quarter payments from AT&T. We did obviously sell iPhones and we will recognize payments from AT&T as revenue over time, as earned.",1
We hope to sell the one millionth one by the end of September.,1
Can you say if the payments from AT&T will be recognized over a two-year period in the life of the contract? Is that the right way to think about it?,1
Gene Iâm sorry I canât answer that question at this time.,1
"Just in terms of the iPhone, I am totally on board with your message that this is going to take some time to ramp, and ultimately it is going to be game-changing. In the near term, as we are all, as we have talked about, getting our arms around how to model this, how do you think about that initial wave of tech nerds that go out and buy the device and that 730,000 estimate that you gave for the September quarter. Are you kind of looking at the current run rate after we had the initial bubble or do you think that bubble is still going on?",1
I just want to make sure that people get their expectations in check over the next couple of quarters versus couple of years?,1
"We feel like we have given quite a bit on this. As I said before, we did 270,000 in the 30 hours last quarter. We expect to sell the one millionth iPhone by the end of September and what we have seen so far gives us a lot of confidence that across 2008 week can sell 10 million iPhones.",1
"So the 730 number that you are looking at for the September quarter, I donât want to put words in your mouth, but is that an existing run rate or is that extrapolating those first couple of days or any thoughts on that?",1
"Total revenue recognized from iPhone and iPhone accessory sales during the June quarter was $5 million. We did not recognize any revenue related to payments from AT&T during the June quarter, but will begin to do so in the September quarter.",1
"Finally, we reiterate our goal of selling 10 million iPhones in calendar 2008.",1
"To ask that first question a second way, can you provide us a percentage of shipments that were PowerMacs in each of those quarters?",1
"In the PC market in Japan, sequentially the market is generally down 15% or so, so the sequential performance is not surprising. In addition to that, we took some number of units out of the channel in iPod.",1
"Charlie, we believe that any legislation that requires the sharing of DRMs will result in state-sponsored piracy, which we think will cause artists to disallow their works to be sold digitally just as the market is beginning to grow. We hope that the countries will let the extremely competitive marketplace, driven by consumer choice, decide which players and online music stores are offered to customers.",1
"Yes, I have one quick follow-up. Will there be any surprises at the Developers Conference?",1
You will have to come and attend.,1
"Thanks, Charlie. Could we have the next question please?",1
Weâll go next to Shaw Wu with American Technology Research.,1
"Thank you. Just some questions on your Japan business. It was down sequentially, double-digit for the second quarter in a row, but up on a year-over-year basis. I am just wondering, is Japan performing up to your expectations? Then, just some comments on the executive departure there. Thanks.",1
"On a year-over-year basis, if you look at Japan and you combine it with our retail stores that are in Japan, we were up 13%. That 13% is lower than the company average of 24, and we are not happy about that. We are continuing to look for and seek improvements in the business in Japan.",1
Weâll go next to Charles Wolf with Needham & Company.,1
"Regarding the change, Shaw, we mutually agreed on his resignation, which has already occurred. Our Japan marketing team will continue to report directly to Phil Schiller in Cupertino, and Phil will take the interim position to lead our overall marketing in Japan.",1
"Thanks, Shaw. Could we have the next question please?",1
"Weâll go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Mr. Munster, your line is open. Please go ahead.",1
"Good afternoon. A couple of international questions. First, if you look at the success you had in the U.S., it really has not rolled out internationally. I think you went over some of the growth rates, and it seemed a little bit less in Europe and Asia. What is the big issue? Is it just a price point issue? Maybe you can address if you think about expanding the Apple brand globally, and a follow-up question.",1
"Gene, if you look at Europe as an example, Europeâs revenue was up 21% year over year; that compares to the company average of 24%. If you combine it with the retail segment, or the groups, the stores that we have in Europe, it was up 22% compared to the company average of 24%. So Europe is very close.",1
"When we deploy a new product, and in this case, we deployed MacBook, as you know, it takes longer to deploy a new product into Europe than it does the U.S. In the first quarter, generally speaking, Europe would get less advantage of a new product. I think that is the primary difference in the growth rate in Europe. Japan we just spoke about.",1
"Yes, I have a question about the music model. I was wondering if the actions of some European countries, most notably France, pose any threat to Apple's music model.",1
"Thanks, Kevin. Could we have the next question please?",1
"The growth rate that we had in Latin America last quarter was tremendous. It almost doubled. However, we can always improve in the absolute level of revenue in that area and we are focused on doing that.",1
"One more question -- I am not sure if it is too early to ask this one yet, but have you been able to gather any data to help you understand if Bootcamp is actually stimulating Mac switchers?",1
We release things at desktop and portable level.,1
"Thanks, Chris. Could we have the next question please?",1
Weâll go next to Bill Shope with JP Morgan.,1
"Thank you. I believe last quarter, you know that you got more aggressive with the market efforts overseas for the iPod. Can you give us some comment on the progress you might have seen in this arena throughout the quarter?",1
"We did get more aggressive. We had put more energy outside the U.S. as we had the supply capability to do that. As a consequence, we saw share gains in several countries in Europe, including the U.K., Spain, Italy and France. We are very pleased with that.",1
"Also, through the month of May, BCN has reported that we saw more of the 50% share in Japan as well, and so we appear to be making good progress.",1
"We released the Beta in April, the number of downloads that we have had are significant, and the customer feedback that weâve had on Bootcamp is very, very good. It is clear that for a Windows user that is considering switching to a Mac, that it makes it even more appealing to them to switch.",1
"Again, we do not have a comment.",1
Weâll go next to Kevin Hunt with Thomas Weisel Partners,1
"Thank you. I had a couple of additional follow-ups on the gross margin question. First of all, in the response to someone asking about why gross margin guidance was down 200 basis points, it sounded to me like you said everything was going to be the same as this quarter, so I guess I am still not clear why it would be down 200 basis points.",1
"Secondly, in terms of the Intel transition on the Mac side, can you talk about what direct impact that might be having, moving to an Intel chip rather than your historical chips? Also, whether using the Intel chipsets essentially lowers any other kind of component cost that you use within the PC?",1
"Again, the reason we are guiding gross margin down is we will see a full quarter impact of the back-to-school promotion. It was a very aggressive promotion, where with a purchase of a qualifying Mac and an iPod Nano, a customer can get a rebate for the iPod Nano. We lowered our international pricing towards the end of the quarter as a result of a weakening in the dollar. We expect a different product mix, including more MacBooks, from having a full quarter of availability.",1
I do not think we have really any comments on our Intel-based product gross margins.,1
Is that a positive factor or a negative factor? Can you at least say that?,1
"What about even markets, like the markets that are not talked much about, like South America and Central America and things like this? You just do not seem to really have much of a footprint at all, and these are obviously big markets.",1
"Then a specific question, just in terms of iPod sales in Europe for the quarter. Can you just give us any sort of indication -- did the growth rate accelerate or was it stable or decline a little bit? Just some general themes around iPod growth in Europe.",1
"Based on surveys like this and other overwhelmingly positive feedback we continue to receive, customers clearly agree with us that the iPhone is a revolutionary product. It took Apple seven quarters, almost two years, to sell our one millionth iPod. We hope to sell our one millionth iPhone by the end of its first full quarter ending September 29th. We are on track to begin selling the iPhone in Europe during the fourth calendar quarter of this year, starting with a few major countries and expanding the number of countries throughout 2008. We will announce our initial plans with our European partners later this quarter.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report strong financial results and another landmark quarter for Apple. Revenue of $5.41 billion was the highest in a June quarter in the history of Apple and represented 24% growth over the prior June quarter sales. The revenue was fueled by record-breaking Mac sales and continued strong demand for iPods.",1
"Thank you, everyone. That does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect.",1
"Welcome to the Apple third quarter 2007 quarterly results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.",1
"Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple's CFO Peter Oppenheimer, and he will be joined by Apple's COO Tim Cook and Treasurer Gary Wipfler, for the Q&A session with analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today may consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, iPhone sales, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.",1
"For more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple Form 10-K for 2006, the Forms 10-Q for the first and second quarters of 2007, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.",1
With that I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.,1
"Operating margin for the quarter was stronger than expected at 19.2%, resulting from higher than expected revenue and the continued, very favorable commodity cost environment. We generated net income of $818 million, which was up 73% over the prior June quarter's results, and translated to earnings per share of $0.92.",1
"Thanks, Steve, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. A recording of today's call will be available for replay via telephone for seven days, beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time today. The number for the replay is 719-457-0820 and the confirmation code is 1069240. A replay of the audio webcast of this call will also be available beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific time today at www.apple.com/investor.",1
"I'd like to talk first about our Mac products and services, which represented 60% of our total quarterly revenue. We're extremely pleased to have shipped 1.76 million Macs, setting an all-time quarterly record for Apple and representing 33% growth over the year-ago quarter. Mac shipments in the U.S. grew by 32% year over year, representing over four times IDC's latest published growth estimate for the U.S. market in the June quarter. On a worldwide basis, Apple's growth rate was more than 2.5 times IDCâs most recently published market growth rate for the quarter.",1
We announced and began shipping the new MacBook and MacBook Pro during the quarter. The MacBook Pro includes the industry's first LED display and demand for both products was very strong. Sales of Mac notebooks grew 42% year over year during the quarter and accounted for 64% of total Macs sold. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.,1
"Now I'd like to discuss our music products and services which accounted for 40% of total revenue during the quarter. We sold 9.8 million iPods, representing 21% growth over the year ago quarter. We began and ended the quarter within our target of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory. We remain very pleased with iPodâs strong leadership position and its 71.5 % share of the U.S. market for MP3 players based on the latest data published by NPD.",1
"Other music revenue grew 33% year over year, once again fueled by very strong iTunes Store sales. NPD reported that iTunes became the third largest overall music retailer in the U.S., surpassing Amazon and Target. We also launched iTunes Plus DRM-free music tracks in the quarter.",1
"The iPhone was on sale for the last 30 hours of the quarter ending June 30th. During the quarter we sold a total of 270,000 iPhones to AT&T and through our Apple retail stores; and 146,000 iPhones were activated by Apple and AT&T. We did have some activation problems during the first week or so, and we would like to apologize to those customers who had less than a perfect activation experience. Since then AT&T has corrected the most common cause of these difficulties and we are now experiencing a very high percentage of problem-free activations.",1
Customers are clearly loving their iPhones. You may have read some of the surveys that have been conducted by independent research firms. One of them quoted in the USA Today on July 12th stated that 90% of iPhone owners surveyed said they were extremely or very satisfied with their phone; and 85% said they were extremely or very likely to recommend the device to others.,1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896. Financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover, or me, with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570, and I am at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
"Steve, on MacBook, we are working very hard to fill our backorders on MacBook.",1
We do not release iPod shipments on a geographic basis.,1
"As regards cell phones, we do not think that the phones that are available today make the best music players. We think the iPod is. But over time, that is likely to change, and we are not sitting around doing nothing.",1
"Can you address if some of the legislative issues in France, or potentially some of the things going on with Sony Ericsson and some of their new products, are you seeing an impact from any of those?",1
"Gene, I have not seen an impact from the Sony products that I can comment on. As I said, I answered this for Charlie, but we just think and hope that the governments will let the extremely competitive marketplace, driven by customer choice, decide which players and which online music stores are offered to consumers.",1
"But it is safe to say that you have not seen an impact from either of those, to the best of your knowledge, Peter?",1
"I have not looked specifically at Sony, so I do not want to comment on that.",1
"Okay. I guess just conceptually, some of the things that Sony is doing, what are your thoughts on that? Obviously, it had tremendous growth with the Sony Walkman phone. When you guys step back and see some of that success, what do you even think about?",1
"Well, we are very confident in our ability to compete in the marketplace, and we are very excited about what we have in the product pipeline. You know that I cannot comment on that.",1
Weâll go next to David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.,1
"I have high confidence in the team here at Apple. We remain very confident in and excited about the products in our pipeline, and look forward to the future.",1
"Thank you. Similar to what you have done on the Mac side, have you done any studies on what percentage of iPod sales are to existing owners? To go along with that, what are you doing to drive sales into your install base between product cycles?",1
"I am not aware of studies or data that we have in that regard, David. In terms of what are we doing -- great marketing, offering great points of presence around the world, both in our retail stores and online and through our channel partners, and offering customers what we think is the absolute best products in the marketplace, in not only the iPod but the iTunes Music Store. I think the market share that we command around the world supports that.",1
"Thanks, David. Could we have the next question please?",1
Weâll go next to Steve Lidberg with Pacific Crest Securities.,1
"Thank you. First, with regard to the MacBook, it seemed like you had shipments relatively within equilibrium exiting the June quarter in terms of supply. Relative to the online store, now you are showing a wait time of five to seven days. Can you give some insight into what that is related to?",1
"Then, as an additional question, Peter, with regard to the last couple of your quarters, you stated and highlighted the strength in the product pipeline, yet really from a product introduction standpoint, what we have seen has been relatively well-anticipated, i.e., the Intel transition devices. Is there some challenges on the execution side of the R&D pipeline? How should we think about that?",1
"Second, we spent less than we had expected in several operating areas, including warranty and manufacturing tools.",1
"Additionally, and to a lesser extent, we benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar and from leverage on higher revenue than we planned.",1
Do you think there are more weapons that you could use in these markets to continue the pace that you have?,1
"A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a web cast on Apple.com/Investor and by telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820, and the confirmation code is 4748846. And these replays will be available beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. PT today.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Appleâs CFO, Peter Oppenheimer; and heâll be joined by Appleâs CEO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information youâll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Appleâs Form 10-K for 2011, the Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2012 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Weâre pleased to report the results of our third fiscal quarter. We established new all-time quarterly record for iPad unit sales and new June quarter records for iPhone and Mac unit sales, leading to our highest June quarter revenue and earnings ever.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $35 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 23%. The $6.5 billion increase over the prior June quarterâs result was driven primarily by strong growth in iPad and iPhone sales.",1
"Operating margin was $11.6 billion, representing 33% of revenue. Net income was $8.8 billion, increasing 21% over the prior June quarterâs results. The quarterâs net income translated to diluted earnings per share of $9.32.",1
"Turning to the details of the quarter, Iâd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We sold 4 million Macs establishing a new June quarter record. This represents 2% growth year-over-year, compared to IDCs latest published estimate of 1% contraction of the global personal computer market in the June quarter.",1
"Last month, we updated the entire MacBook lines with faster processors, graphics, memory, flash storage and USB 3.0 connectivity. We also introduced the all-new 15 inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display, all flash architecture and quad core processors and customer response has been excellent.",1
"While receiving tremendous momentum for the iPad in education, which Iâll discuss later, we also experienced our best quarter ever for U.S. education institution Mac sales with Portables representing nearly three quarters of total Mac sales.",1
"Notable large education transaction closed during the June quarter, include Rutherford County, North Carolina, which has purchased 6,000 MacBook Airs to support its 21st Century Digital Learning Environment, and Pueblo Colorado School District 70 were all high school students and K-12 staff in the 22 School District will convert to MacBook Air. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory, which is below our target range of four to five weeks.",1
"Tomorrow, we will release Mountain Lion, the ninth major release of OS X. Mountain Lion introduces more than 200 features including all-new messages app, notification center, system wide sharing, and Facebook integration. We built iCloud into the foundation of Mountain Lion, making it easier than ever for customers to keep content up-to-date across all their devices.",1
"Moving to our music products, we sold 6.8 million iPods compared to 7.5 million in the year ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectation and iPod Touch continue to account for over half of all iPod sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remained at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD and iPod continue to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK.",1
"We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory. The iTunes Store generated very strong results in the quarter with revenue of over 1.8 billion, thanks to continued strong sales of music, apps and other content. We are pleased to launch the iTunes Store in 12 countries including Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan last month. Customers can choose from over 20 million songs to purchase and download from iTunes.",1
"Weâre continuing to see great interest in iTunes U. Since rolling it out in January, there have been over 40 million downloads of the iTunes U app. Over 700 new K-12 schools and districts and over 125 colleges and universities have enrolled in the iTunes U program, while over 750 new courses have been published.",1
Iâd now like to turn to iPhone. We sold 26 million iPhones compared to 20.3 million in the previous June quarter; that represents 28% year-over-year growth and was ahead of the amount we factored into our guidance following very strong sales in channel inventory build we achieved in the March quarter. We added several small regional carriers during the quarter and now have iPhone distribution through over 250 carriers in over 100 countries.,1
"Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Release Call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.",1
"Thanks, Brian. That concludes our Q&A session. A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks as a Podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone, and the numbers for the telephone replay are (888) 203-1112 or (719) 457-0820. Please enter confirmation code 9915940. These replays will be available beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at (408) 974-1896. And then financial analysts can contact either Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at (408) 974-4570, and I'm at (408) 974-5420. And thanks again for joining us.",1
"Sure. Brian, it's Peter. We have a very, very broad library of movies and TV shows particularly here in the United States. We are adding more content internationally each quarter and look for some more content later this quarter across the various stores. We have some neat stuff coming.",1
We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.,1
"We have a dual-prong strategy with enterprise on both the iPad and the iPhone. As we work with the carrier sales forces and they have very large ones because they're selling their services into enterprise and many of these enterprises want that one of our device is connected to it and so we train and provide quite a bit of help to the carrier forces. Plus we do some sales, directly our sales or act as an overlay sales force to a channel that sells to enterprise. And I would characterize this as we're still building it out and we do a bit better each quarter. We're very, very happy with the numbers that Peter talked about earlier about the level of interest and taking people to the pilot and initial deployment stages. And now our attention is moving to penetration within those accounts versus sort of getting on the standards lists. And I think you'd really look at it fairly to be this far into the enterprise with a product that's only been shipping for 15 months in the case of iPad is absolutely incredible, because the enterprise is typically much more conservative and takes a long time to evaluate products. In this case, people are moving at a speed I haven't seen. Also in a group that's not thought of as enterprise like K-12, our K-12 generally takes a very long time for new product categories, but last quarter, we sold more iPads in K-12 than we did not. And to do that after just 5 quarters is absolutely shocking. We would've never predicted that. And so we feel very, very good about the different area that iPad is being sold into. It's clear it has a universal appeal in many different markets from consumer to business to government and on and on.",1
"From Wedge Partners, we'll go to Brian Blair.",1
Can you just talk a little bit about your views on iCloud and just how you feel as a service it's going to drive more volumes to Mac and maybe just talk about what are your expectations on the halo effect across other iOS devices?,1
"This is Peter. We cannot wait to get iCloud and iOS 5 into the hands of customers in the fall. We really think that we have done it right with iCloud. We're going to deliver customers just a seamless integrated experience that we think that they are going to love. We're going to make it very easy and it didn't go unnoticed back to us yesterday that in the ChangeWave results, that was one of the reasons cited why the iOS devices are #1 in terms of intent to buy.",1
"And maybe just briefly, if you can comment on, just do you feel like you have much of a lead over your competitors and the ability to instantly mirror content across different devices? It feels like it's a real competitive edge for you, but I'd love to hear your thought if you wouldn't mind sharing any.",1
"Well, we're certainly very, very good with the Internet, with telecommunications in delivering content. I think we have proven it in Mac for a decade first beginning with iTunes and now with the App Store and our payments to developers exceeding $2.5 billion. So we probably have some things to learn as we go forward. But have a lot of skills and are very excited to get iCloud in the customers' hands.",1
"Tim, I wanted to revisit China and also prepaid phones. China Mobile recently said it has 5.6 million phones on its net -- iPhones on its network as of the end of May, and was adding them at an incredible rate. Obviously, China Mobile doesn't sell the phone. So that would certainly point to a lot of a prepaid phones or unlocked phones on their network. I believe also your direct distribution in China for the iPhone, both online and retail stores is in a prepaid fashion. So I was wondering if you could tell us how significant prepaid is in China and other emerging markets, how much progress you've made there and what lessons you've learned given that you yourselves are also selling them prepaid? And I have a follow-up, please.",1
"And then perhaps a quick follow-up. With respect to content accumulation in regards to video, can you talk a little bit why we don't have more movie titles on iTunes at this point, and if we are going to be rectifying that in the future?",1
"Prepaid or unlocked phones are, said more an English, phones sold without a contract are very key in China and very key in a number of the emerging markets, where the credit systems are not as well established as they are in the U.S., Japan and Western Europe and Australia, et cetera. And so you can look at our volume, Toni, that the iPhone volume for the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year was up 5x year-over-year. And iPhone is the key contributor to Greater China having a cumulative revenue of around $8.8 billion for the first 3 quarters. And so I am not saying at all that we have figured out precisely how to play perfectly in the environment we have and I think we have more to do and more to learn. But I feel very, very good about our progress. I think if any of us would have been told a year ago that we would do $3.8 billion in Greater China in a quarter, I don't think very many of us would've believed it. And I don't think any of you would've believed that. And so we feel very, very good about it and we're taking those learnings and applying those to other markets as well.",1
"If I could follow up, your market share data is pretty irrefutable, and it's pretty consistent in terms of your being a share gainer. There are parts of the world in developed countries like U.K., Germany, France and Japan, where some of the recent market data suggests that you've actually lost share in iPhones on a year-over-year basis in Q2. I was wondering if you could tell us whether gaining share in the smartphone category for iPhone is strategically important to Apple longer term, and how we get our minds around sustained share gains given that most of the market data says smartphones above $300 are going to grow a lot slower than the overall smartphone market. So how do we: a, are share gains important to Apple in this marketplace; and how do we reconcile where you participate in its market growth rate relative to the overall market?",1
"Share gain is important anywhere where we are going, the opposite way then we're not happy. And you can bet that we're working hard to change that. In terms of playing in different price points, we do offer the 3GS, as an example today, which in the U.S. is $49 with a contract. And if you step that out into prepaid market, it really depends upon the VAT and duty and channel kind of uplifts as to what it is. So it varies greatly market-to-market. But it's clearly, in a distinctly different price than the iPhone 4 is. Our philosophy is the same as it's always been, Toni. We will only make products that we're proud of, that are the best in the world, and if we can do that and the price is lower then we're great with that. An example of that, that happened some time ago is the iPod shuffle was created. It started at a different price point, but it's now at $49 and that's because it's a product we're very proud of. It's very innovative. A lot of people love that product. So that's always the question for us in the litmus test. We will only make products that we're very proud of, that we want to own, that are the best in the world and regardless of what the price band analysis. Also, as we've seen and as I'm reminded time and time again as I look at some of the China data is it's up to us to convince people to maybe spend a little more for a materially better experience of product. And we think that people will do that if the product is great and if it's messaged appropriately and we got a lot of experience in both of those areas.",1
We'll hear from Brian Marshall with Gleacher & Company.,1
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you've learned with respect to media consumption on the iPad thus far?,1
"We learned that people love using it, Brian, for a whole variety of things. And that's the beauty of the iPad is that if you talk to 10 people, they would likely give you 10 different reasons why they love it. And I think that's the reason it's doing so well among a very diverse group of consumers in a diverse group of people in the market and geographies.",1
"We ended the quarter with about 8.3 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential decline of about 300,000 iPhones, and we remained within our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $16.2 billion during the quarter compared to $13.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 22%.",1
Enterprises across the globe continue to choose iPhone as the standard device for their employees. We estimate that the number of iPhones in the Fortune 500 has more than doubled in the past year. iPhone is helping businesses and employees to be more productive wherever they are.,1
"PepsiCo has deployed thousands of iPhones with an in-house app build specifically for their field merchandisers. This app has eliminated paper reports and provides real-time information to managers, sales teams and delivery drivers.",1
"Thank you, Kathy. Could we have the next question please.",1
"We expect the gross margin as I said to be about 38.5%, which is down about 430 basis points sequentially. We expect most of this decline to be primarily driven by a fall transition and to a much lesser extent, the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The warranty benefit that we saw in the June quarter is not repeating and a full quarter of the Back to School promotion. So thatâs what we see doing it, Katy.",1
"Okay. And then as a follow-up Tim, youâve obviously seen spectacular growth in China over the last several years, but there are some macro concerns in the market and your Asia-Pacific growth rate did decelerate from over 100% to I think 25% this quarter. So, can you talk about what youâre seeing in China as it relates to overall demand? Thank you.",1
"Yes, Katy. Hi, itâs Tim. The growth in Asia-Pacific was 25% as you indicated, and the vast majority of the difference in our sequential growth rate was a result of Greater China, which represents about two-thirds of our revenue of that region. As we reported for Q2, our Greater China revenue was $7.9 billion; and in Q3, our revenue was $5.7 billion. Now the $5.7 billion is a 48% year-over-year increase and so, it still is growing at incredible rates. Virtually, all of the $2.2 billion sequential revenue decline, was due to iPhone sales in Greater China and about half of that $2.2 billion is attributable to changes in the channel inventory not the underlying sell through of the iPhone.",1
"As a reminder, in the previous quarter, in our fiscal Q2, we launched the iPhone 4S in China in January. We added China Telecom as the second carrier in March, and as we proceeded across the quarter, we increased the channel inventory to accommodate the sales and to reach our target inventory of four to six weeks. The remainder of the sequential revenue decline is mainly attributable to normal seasonality after the very successful iPhone 4S launch. We did not see an obvious impact in Q3 that we would associate with the economy in Mainland China. We look at the economic report as all of you do and see the press. But again, we did not see something that we would attribute to the economy in China.",1
"In terms of iPhones in general in Mainland China, we were incredibly pleased with our results. We were up over 100% year-over-year, and as you probably know, just last Friday, so in Q4, we launched our new iPad in China after we resolved the iPad trademark issue. And so our sales did not benefit from the new iPad in the June quarter in Mainland China. Also, our new portables that we announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference began to ship in Mainland China last week after we received routine regulatory approval, and once again, the June quarter sales did not benefit from these products.",1
"So, net, we remain really confident about our plans and are very excited about our opportunity in China, and are very much looking forward to incorporating more local services as you probably saw in the Worldwide Developers Conference announcement of iOS 6, which will be coming in the fall.",1
"Okay. Great, thanks. Can you talk about your thoughts on the individual segment trends when looking at your guidance. I know last quarter youâve given us some thoughts on that. Could you walk through how weâre thinking about it now coming off of the sequential declines this quarter particularly on the iPhone segment?",1
(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Kathy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Sure, Bill, itâs Peter. Let me start off and if Tim wants to add something, he can. I will first talk about the products and then a little bit about how we are thinking of revenue. For iPhone, we would expect to have a year-over-year increase in sales in the September quarter. For iPad, we would also expect to have a year-over-year increase, but we would point out that we increased channel inventory in the June quarter by 1.2 million units. And in the year ago quarter, we also increased the iPad inventory at that time by 1.5 million units. And for Mac, we would expect a sequential increase.",1
"As we think about revenue, weâre providing revenue guidance that is up by 20% year-over-year. Weâve included several things on our â thinking. The first, we are not expecting the economies in Europe or the natural resource based countries including Australia, Brazil and Canada to improve from what we saw in the June quarter. As Tim said, we saw no obvious evidence of the economy impacting our sales in China in the June quarter or in the U.S., but we are reading the same things that you all are about these economies. So we will have to see.",1
Our weekly iPhone sales continue to be impacted by rumors and speculation regarding new products. We exited the June quarter in supply and demand balance and we were within our four to six week inventory target. We also donât expect to add any significant new country or carrier additions in the September quarter.,1
"Regarding iPad, as I said, weâre able to increase our iPad channel inventory in the June quarter by 1.2 million units and we ended the June quarter just within our four to six week channel inventory target and we increased last year by 1.5 million units in the September quarter, which also put us in our four to six week inventory target. These increases in channel inventory will impact both the year-over-year and sequential compares for iPad. The current iPad lineup that we're selling includes the very successful $399 price point, which we did not have in the year-ago quarter. So this, along with mix in the line will impact the ASPs in the September quarter.",1
"And finally, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most currencies around the world including the euro, Brazilian Real, the Chinese RMB, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso and Swiss Franc. We expect this to have an adverse impact to revenue in these countries in excess of $400 million sequentially net of our hedges. All that being said, we very much look forward to introducing iOS 6 in the fall and we remain very confident in our business and our new product pipeline.",1
"Okay. And just to follow-up if I could on the sequential iPhone decline. you gave us a pretty good outline of what was going on in China, but can you walk us through some of the trends you saw for iPhone demand sequentially in the other international region?",1
"Yes, thank you. Peter, I want to better understand the gross margin guidance for September, given that itâs been nearly two years since youâve operated at a sub-40% gross margin. I understand mix may go against you a little bit in the near-term, but it should be structurally higher than two years ago, you have NAND pricing moving in your favor, and the products that youâre selling in the market are relatively mature, so manufacturing cost should be favorable. Can you just talk about the dynamics that are pushing gross margins down again in September? Then Iâve a follow-up.",1
"Weâd like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?",1
"German insurance provider ERGO has built an in-house app for iPhone that thousands of agents use to process insurance claims, which has significantly reduced paper work and improved processing time and customer satisfaction.",1
"In June, we previewed many of the exciting new features of iOS 6 at our Developers Conference, including our fabulous new maps app, new functionality and broader language support for Siri, direct Facebook integration, shared photo streams via iCloud and Passbook, the simplest way to get all your passes in one place. We believe iOS 6 will significantly enhance the experience of one in an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch, and we canât wait to get it into the hands of customers this fall.",1
"Turning to iPad, we were thrilled with sales of over 17 million iPads during the June quarter compared to 9.2 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 84%. We saw very strong year-over-year growth in iPad sales around the world and are pleased to be selling iPad in 97 countries.",1
"Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $9.2 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 52%. We ended the quarter with about 3.2 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.2 million units, which left us just within our target range of four to six weeks of iPad channel inventory.",1
"The iPad continues to be a great success in the U.S. education market, with sales setting a new quarterly record and nearly doubling year-over-year to just under 1 million iPads. While interest in the new iPad was high, sales of the reduced price iPad 2 in the K-12 market were particularly strong. And even though, as I mentioned earlier, we achieved all time record Mac sales to U.S. education institutions during the quarter. We sold more than twice as many iPads as Macs to U.S. education institutions. We are extremely pleased with these results.",1
"One great example of iPad adoption in education is the Mansfield Texas Independent School District, which has purchased 11,000 iPads. This fall, every Mansfield High School student and teacher will receive an iPad under the districtâs Power Up initiative. Some teachers will use a flipped classroom concept, putting their lessons and resources online where students can access them anytime with their iPads. As a result, students take responsibility for their own learning and teachers are able to increase their interactions and personalize content time.",1
"iPad continues its rapid adoption within the enterprise. We estimate that the number of iPads in the Fortune 500 has more than tripled in the past year. iPad has become an indispensable tool worldwide to help employees across industries do their jobs more effectively. British Airways has incorporated thousands of iPads across their business from customer support at check-in to cabin service directors replacing paper printout to details customer preferences and provide real-time updates. And homebuilder Dialogue House in Japan is actively building smart homes that will be controlled by iPads, and their sales reps are using iPads to show floor plans and upgrade options.",1
"Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, we surpassed 410 million cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 45 million in the June quarter. With App Stores in 155 countries, the iOS ecosystem continues to grow. The App Store now offers more than 650,000 apps, including over 225,000 apps specifically for iPad. Weâre extremely pleased to report that we have surpassed $5.5 billion in payment to developers, and customers are loving iCloud. Since its launch in October, more than 150 million people are using iCloud services.",1
"Iâd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue was $4.1 billion, an increase of 17% over the year-ago quarter, with growth yield primarily by all-time record iPad sales and strong growth in iPhone sales. The store sold 791,000 Macs compared to 768,000 in the year-ago quarter. And almost half the Macs sold in our stores during the quarter were the customers who had never owned a Mac before.",1
With that Iâd like to open the call to questions.,1
"We opened a total of nine new stores in the quarter and exited the quarter with 372 stores, including 123 stores outside the United States. With an average of 367 stores opened, average revenue per store was $11.1 million compared to $10.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Segment margin was $868 million compared to $802 million in the year-ago quarter. We welcomed 83 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, compared to 74 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 12%. That translates to an average of 17,000 visitors per store per week.",1
"Total company gross margin was 42.8%, which was 130 basis points higher than our guidance. We experienced upside from better than expected commodity, warranty and other costs. These factors were partially offset by a stronger mix of iPad sales, a higher mix of lower priced iPhones, and a stronger U.S. dollar relative to our expectations. Operating expenses were $3.4 billion and included $378 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $288 million and the tax rate was 25.6%.",1
"Turning to cash, our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $117.2 billion at the end of the June quarter compared to $110 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of $7 billion, and about $81 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of the June quarter. Cash flow from operations was $10.2 billion.",1
"Today, weâre announcing that our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $2.55 per common share payable on August 16, 2012 to stockholders of record after the close of business on August 13, 2012. Going forward, subject to declaration by our Board, we expect to announce record and payment dates for future dividends concurrently with our quarterly earnings announcements. Also, as we previously announced, our Board has authorized a three-year $10 billion share repurchase program starting in our fiscal 2013, which begins on September 30, 2012.",1
"As we move ahead into the September quarter, Iâd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $34 billion compared to $28.3 billion in the September quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 38.5%, reflecting approximately $70 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.5 billion, including about $390 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $175 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.50%. We are targeting EPS of about $7.65.",1
"In closing, weâre pleased with our record June quarter results, including sales of over 17 million iPads. We established new June quarter records for unit sales of iPhone and Macs and posted our best quarter ever for U.S. education. We remain extremely confident in our strategy and the investments we are making in our business. Weâre very excited to be launching Mountain Lion tomorrow and iOS 6 in the fall and we have some more amazing new products in our pipeline that we look forward to discussing with you later.",1
"And maybe just a quick follow-up, Tim. Is there anything you guys are doing differently as far as investing in the enterprise sales force, so to speak, or doing anything differently as far as going to market on the enterprise side that you can point us to? And then, I guess, we'll see the fruits of that labor as we sort of go forward here.",1
"This is a good sort of problem per se is that the demand is fantastic. And so there's not something that I would point to on a supply side saying that this is creating a huge issue, it's the good problem. And as I said before, and I generally don't do that, but in this case, I am to talk about July. In the first weeks of July, we're now 3 -- a little over 3 weeks into the quarter. Supply has further improved since we ended our June quarter and that further improvement has led some SKUs in some countries to become in supply-demand balance. Now, I'm not going to project what will happen to the other country, but obviously, we're working very, very hard to get as many units to customers as we can. And we placed our latest thinking in the guidance obviously.",1
"Tim, could you maybe provide a bit more color around what exactly the issues are for the iPad ramping up into the sort of levels that you want to get to? And can you hazard a guess as to when you think you'll be at sort of equilibrium on a global basis from a production and supply standpoint?",1
"We expect revenue to be about $25 billion compared to $20.3 billion in the September quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 38%, reflecting approximately $55 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.725 billion, including about $245 million related to stock-based compensation expense.",1
"We plan to open 30 new stores in the September quarter, including our first store in Hong Kong. That will bring us to a total of 40 store openings in fiscal 2011, including 28 new stores outside United States.",1
"Total company gross margin was 41.7%, which was 370 basis points higher than our guidance. This difference was a result of 3 approximately equal factors: a stronger mix of iPhone; lower commodity and other costs, which included some one-time items; and leverage on the higher revenue. Operating expenses were $2.54 billion and included $232 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&E was $172 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 23.5%.",1
"Turning to cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $76.2 billion at the end of the June quarter compared to $65.8 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of $10.4 billion. Cash flow from operations was $11.1 billion, an increase of 131% year-over-year.",1
"I'd now like to talk about the accounting implications of some of the new aspects of our products and services. First, when we deliver Mac OS X Lion to customers, we are now including the right to receive future unspecified minor software upgrades and features when and if they become available for both the Mac operating system and our suite of Mac OS allied [ph] applications. We will continue to charge for standalone sales of our periodic major OS upgrades, such as Lion, as well as major upgrades of iLife. Revenue from these standalone sales will now be fully deferred at the time of sale and recognized over a period of 3 years. In addition to this future software upgrade right, Mac customers will have access to iCloud services when they become available in the fall. We estimate that the combined value of the software upgrade right and iCloud services for Mac customers is $22. Therefore, as of June 6, we began deferring $22 of the revenue associated with each new Mac sold. And we will recognize these deferred amounts as revenue over a period of 4 years.",1
"Purchasers of IOS devices will also have access to iCloud. So beginning on June 6, we begin to sign a portion of the revenue from each iOS device sold to represent the estimated value of the right to receive iCloud services when they become available. That deferred amount is in addition to the amount that we will already deferring for each iOS device sold to represent the right to receive future iOS software upgrades.",1
"As a result, beginning on June 6, we are deferring a total of $16 of revenue for each iPhone and iPad sold and a total of $11 for each iPod touch sold and recognizing those amounts over a period of 2 years. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking statements that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
We expect OI&E to be about $50 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 24%. We are targeting EPS of about $5.50.,1
"I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which generated record June quarter results. Revenue grew to $3.5 billion from $2.6 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 36%. This growth was driven primarily by higher volumes of iPad, iPhones and Macs. The store sold 768,000 Macs compared to 677,000 Macs in the year ago quarter, an increase of 13%. And about half of the Macs sold in our stores during the June quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. We opened 4 new stores in the quarter, including 2 in France, 1 in the U.K. and 1 in Germany, ending with a total of 327. With an average of 325 stores open, average revenue per store was $10.8 million compared to $9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 20%. Retail segment margin was $828 million compared to $593 million in the year ago quarter. Store traffic continues to be very strong. We hosted 73.7 million visitors in the June quarter compared to 60.5 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 22%.",1
"In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record revenue and earnings and the tremendous customer response to our products. Through the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2011, we have generated $35 billion in year-over-year revenue growth translating to a 78% increase. At the same time, we have generated over $9.5 billion in year-over-year earnings growth, representing a 99% increase. We remain very excited about our new product pipeline and we look forward to releasing the Mac OS X Lion tomorrow and bring in the wonderful new features of iOS 5 and iCloud to customers this fall. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"The 12% revenue downtick, Peter, in September is much more conservative than your typical September guidance and what you end up reporting in September, which is usually a 20% plus increase for the last 4 years. Can you help us understand why you expect this next quarter to trend softer than seasonal and maybe how you handicap the impact from some of the new software services and products that you expect to launch in the quarter?",1
"Sure. Let me start with the units and I'll give you some thoughts on revenue. For the education-buying season, September has historically been more weighted to higher education and we would expect this to be the same this year. We have the best line-up of Macs ever and we'd expect to see a year-over-year increase in sales. We also expect a year-over-year increase in iPhone sales. And for iPad, we're continuing to expand our quarterly production capacity and point of sale and we'd expect a significant year-over-year increase in sales. For iPod, we would expect to see a sequential year-over-year decline. As we announced at WWDC, we have a lot going on in the fall with the introduction of iOS 5 and iCloud. We also have a future product transition that we're not going to talk about today and these things will impact our September quarter. We remain very confident in our business, our new product pipeline and our momentum.",1
"Peter, as that relates to future product transitions, can you just remind us how you approach working those into your guidance, you tend to be conservative and wait and see what happens with those products?",1
"Well, as I've said a moment ago, we're not going to talk about this in any detail today. We factored our thinking into our guidance. We are incredibly confident about our business, our new product pipeline and what we're doing.",1
"Our recently launched, personal setup program is off to a great start. Customers love this new feature the retail store experience that they're up and running with their new products before they leave. During the June quarter, we set up over 2 million Macs, iPhone, iPads and iPods collectively.",1
"The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 425,000 apps available in over 15 billion downloads to date. And as we mentioned last month, we're extremely pleased to have reached over 2.5 billion in cumulative payments to iOS developer, far ahead of any of our competitors.",1
"Tim, could you talk a bit about iPad 2 sales and trends? It's still relatively early I suppose, but I'm curious as to what you're seeing in terms of any potential cannibalization or shift of people away from portables, just any thoughts you have on the iPad 2?",1
"The iTunes store generated strong results with revenue of almost $1.4 billion. iTunes revenue was up 36% year-over-year, thanks primarily to continued strong sales of music, video and apps. With more than 225 million accounts, iTunes is the #1 music retailer in the world and customers have downloaded more than 15 billion songs today.",1
"Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Inc. Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer; and he'll be joined by Apple COO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with the analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2010, the Form 10-Q for the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2011, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective date. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We're thrilled to report the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple history. We also set a new all-time quarterly record for iPhone and iPad sales and a new June quarter record for Mac sales and we're extremely pleased with the momentum of our business. Revenue for the quarter was $28.6 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 82%. This record quarterly revenue topped the previous record established in the most recent December quarter by $1.8 billion and was almost $13 billion over the year ago quarter's result. The tremendous year-over-year increase was fueled primarily by dramatic growth in iPhone and iPad sales in addition to strong growth in Mac sales. Operating margin was a record high of $9.4 billion, representing 32.8% of revenue. Net income was $7.3 billion, topping the previous quarterly record set in the December quarter by $1.3 billion.",1
"Net income grew even faster than revenue, increasing 125% year-over-year and translated to earnings per share of $7.79. Turning to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established the new June quarter record with sales of 3.95 million Macs representing a 14% increase over the year ago quarter's result. This growth is more than 4x IDCs most recently published forecast of 3% growth for the PC market overall. Mac sales were particularly strong in our Asia-Pacific segment, where we experienced a 57% year-over-year increase in total Macs sold. We generated healthy Mac growth in both desktop and portable categories. In May, we updated the iMac with the next-generation quad core processors, powerful new graphics, high speed portable I/O technology and a new space time, HD camera. The growth in Mac portable sales was driven by strong sales of MacBook Pro, as well as MacBook Air. We began to enter the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory.",1
"We are very excited to be launching Mac OS X Lion tomorrow. The Lion includes more than 250 new features such as a multi-touch gestures, system wide support for full screen apps, Mission Control, which is an innovative view of everything running on your Mac and much more.",1
Moving to our music products. We sold 7.5 million iPods compared to 9.4 million in the year ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations and iPod touch continues to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD. And iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory.,1
"I'd now like to turn to the iPhone. We were thrilled to sell a record 20.3 million iPhones compared to 8.4 million in the previous June quarter. This represents 142% year-over-year growth, which is more than double IDC's latest published estimate of 67% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the June quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales were $13.3 billion during the quarter compared to $5.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 150%. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year iPhone sales growth in all of our operating segments. iPhone sales momentum in the Asia-Pacific region was particularly robust with sales almost quadrupling year-over-year. We continue to increase our overall iPhone manufacturing capacity in the quarter. We were pleased to launch a number of new carrier relationships. And by the end of the quarter, iPhone was available through 228 carriers in 105 countries, compared to 186 carriers in 90 countries as of the end of the March quarter. We ended the quarter with about 5.9 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 700,000 to support strong iPhone demand, carrier addition and expanded distribution. We remained within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory.",1
"In June, we also provided a preview of iCloud, our set of free new services that work seamlessly with applications on the customer's iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac or PC to automatically and wirelessly store content in the cloud, as well as push it to all the users' devices. We think customers will love using iCloud and we look forward to its release in the fall.",1
"iPhone continues to be adopted as the standard across the enterprise with 91% of the Fortune 500 deployed or testing the device, up from 88% last quarter. We're also seeing great growth in scale worldwide. Today, 57% of Global 500 companies are testing or deploying iPhone, fueled by strong employee demand and opportunities for custom App development. Some examples of Global 500 companies supporting iPhones on their corporate networks, include AXA, Credit Agricole, NestlÃ©, Dow Chemical, GlaxoSmithKline, SUPERVALU and Comcast.",1
"Turning to iPad. We continue to be thrilled with its incredible momentum. We sold a record 9.2 million iPads during the June quarter compared to 3.3 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 183%. We were able to increase production sequentially by over 4.5 million and we sold every iPad we can make. We launched iPad 2 in an additional 36 countries. And combining the original iPad and iPad 2, we ended the quarter with distribution in a total of 64 countries. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was over 6 billion, compared to 2.2 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 179%. We ended the quarter with about 1.05 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 200,000, which was well below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks. Today, 86% of the Fortune 500 are deploying or testing iPad within their enterprises, up from 75% last quarter.",1
"We are also seeing strong adoption internationally with 47% of Global 500 companies testing or deploying iPad. In the 15 months since iPad has shipped, we've seen iPads used in the enterprise in ways we could have never imagined. Companies like Boston Scientific, Xerox and Salesforce.com are deploying thousands of iPads and revolutionize in how their sales teams engage their customers. iPad is being used inside the country's top hospitals like HCA and Cedars-Sinai and in retail at Nordstrom and at EsteÃ© Lauder's Clinique counters. General Electric, SAP and Standard Charter have developed internal Apps for training, currency tracking and business process management to help make employees even more productive. And Alaska Airlines and American Airlines are using the iPad in cockpit to replace paper-based navigational and reference information pilots carry with him on every flight.",1
"We continue to be delighted by the diverse and sometimes, unexpected use cases we see around iPad. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we reached over 222 million cumulative iOS device sales through the end of the June quarter.",1
"Last month, we provided a preview of iOS 5, which includes over 200 new features such as notification center for viewing and managing notifications without interruption, iMessage for sending text messages, photos and videos between iOS devices and Newsstand, a new way to purchase an organized newspaper and magazine subscriptions.",1
"With the new PC-free feature, iOS 5 users will be able to activate and set up iOS devices right out of the box with no computer required. We are looking forward to launching iOS 5 this fall.",1
"From Cross Research, we'll go to Shannon Cross.",1
"Yes. Sure, Shannon. In terms of cannibalization, we do believe that some customers chose to purchase an iPad instead of the new Mac during the quarter, but we also believe that even more customers chose to purchase an iPad over Windows PC. And as I've said before, there's a lot more of the Windows PC business to cannibalize than the Mac. Also, we believe that the Mac has many other attributes that would make it continue to do well in the market. We're very happy that we grew 14% versus the markets growth of 2.6%, which is about 5x as Peter said earlier. And so that's what we see with iPad. As Peter said earlier, we were still selling every unit we could make during the quarter and that was the situation as we ended the quarter. As we stepped into July over the initial weeks to give you a more current update, we had been able to increase the supply further. And some SKUs and some countries are at a supply-demand balance, but we're still working very hard on the balance of the world. The sales of iPad 2 have absolutely been a frenzy for people to give one and we feel very good about the progress that we've made about ramping up and the reception that it received in marketplace.",1
"From Bank of America, we'll go to Scott Craig.",1
"Tim, the trajectory of iPhone growth has been nothing less of astounding because, now you're 142%. You were 113%, last quarter, 86%. So I'm just trying to understand what your thinking is on the keys to sustain that growth. Particularly, do you see the current pricing, for example, and tariffs perhaps approaching a level, maybe North America saw saturation. Do you need to address that? Different form back factors, expanded distribution or just stay on the same business model, especially these lower cost Android competitors potentially coming from Asia? Can you talk to that?",1
"Apple TV continues to do well, but I don't want to mislead. We still call it a hobby here and we do that because we don't want anyone to conclude that it's another leg of the stool because it's not in the same market that iPhone is in, or that the iPad is in, or that the Mac is in, or that the iPod is in. And so we love the product It's clear that customers love the product. We really guided right when we went to the new Apple TV just last fall. But right now, it's still a hobby status that we're continuing to invest in it because we think that there is something there.",1
"I just want to touch base here, Tim, on just the scintillating sales velocity. Is Apple at a point now where you kind of diversify your contract manufacturing base, as well as even your non-Apple retail channel? And what are the opportunity and risk there?",1
"In terms of the non-Apple retail channel, if you take the iPhone as an example, which as you know makes up a large percentage of our business, we have about 115,000 points of sale. And so I feel that we're incredibly diversified. We're selling through carriers, through retail. We're selling through our own stores, through our online store. We're selling through companies that have direct sales forces. We are selling to enterprise, including an overlay sales force of our own. So I think the channel is extremely well-diversified. There are still countries, where we're still building the channel and so I don't want to give you a view that I think the journey is completed, but in the mature markets I feel that the channels are in good shape. And in the markets, where we're putting more and more energy, obviously, there is still channel development to do there, but I think it's well understood and under control. So as I don't, really, that's not something that I worry about at all, actually. In terms of suppliers, I don't want to get into this in any detail, because I think this is one of those things for us that is the part of the magic and a part of the things that we feel that we have some secret sauce in and I prefer not to share it. But your general point about, are we too centralized in one place, or are we too dependent on a place. You can -- the people hear that are involved in the supply chain, we got some outstanding ones, always ask that question and I think we always at the end of the day make the right decision for Apple.",1
"Understood. Appreciate that. Maybe just a follow-up for you Tim or Peter. You've talked in the past about the iPhone and the iPad 2 just because of the leading edge technology that sometimes the manufacturing yield are a little lighter than what we all think. Where are you guys now in terms of manufacturing yields, have you walked further up the curve in terms of better utilization?",1
"I don't want to give you a specific yield numbers, but as I've said earlier, the supply of iPad improved dramatically in the quarter, that allowed us to do the over 9.2 million, that's up from the 4.7 from the prior quarters that we added almost 100%. I also said that we had further incurred the supply in the initial weeks of July. And that's allowed us to get into a supply-demand balance on some SKUs and some countries. So I feel very, very good about our progress in that area.",1
Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.,1
"Well, I think on the tariff side, Apple doesn't set the tariffs. So it is set by the carrier. And so I think that's a better question for them, but at a very macro level, I think what you would find if you went out and talked to several around the world is that virtually every one of them are desirous of having more and more customer have a smartphone and begin to use data on their networks because this is the way for them to expand their ARPUs. And I firmly believe there is no better device than the iPhone for someone to move from any phone up to a smartphone. So ease of use is just unparalleled, and the ecosystem is unparallel. And so I think there is a good alignment in that area. I mentioned a few moments ago that the key driver in our sequential results on the iPhone are sequential improvement in unit, we're emerging and developing market. So you can see that we're putting more and more energy in these markets that have been a bit more difficult to do well in versus some of the markets that are in the established countries and subsidized countries or they're primarily subsidizing. So I think we have a very good focus here. And I think we can compete with anyone.",1
"I think the Android activation number is a difficult one to get our hands around, because unlike our numbers, which you can kind of go to our data sheet and you can add the iPods and the iPads and make a reasonable approximation of the iPod touch which spans over half of our iPod sales. You can quickly see that in the June quarter that we sold over 33 million iOS devices and across time, as Peter mentioned in his opening comments, we are now over 222 million cumulative iOS devices. And so we think this is incredible. And so our numbers are very straight forward, they're transparent and they're reported quarterly. In terms of iPhone, iPhone is up 142% year-over-year. This is more than 2x the rate of growth of the smartphone market. We think that's incredible. Also, as Peter said earlier, we sold every iPad 2 in the quarter that we could make and so there certainly was not a shortage of demand. We're also gaining traction in enterprise. From the numbers that Peter spoke of, obviously, now our attention is not turning to getting corporations to test and pilots, but it's more -- was really converted to more of a penetration focus. Our App Store is the largest by far and if you look at iPad specific apps, we are over 100,000. And I think you would be hard-pressed to find a little bit of a few 100 on the other platform. It also doesn't appear that the other tablets are getting any traction to speak of, and we've paid over $2.5 billion to developers and so there's a great business proposition for developers and you can tell the customers about it because we have well over 15 billion apps that have been downloaded. And so we're very, very confident of the product. We're confident with the App Store. We're confident with our proposition for developers. The customer stat in every survey I had seen ranks the iPhone #1. And so we're very confident in the customer reception. We're also very confident in our roadmap and so we feel very, very good. You may have seen the data that just came out, I believe, it was yesterday, from ChangeWave that reaffirmed once again that iPhone is the clear leader in customer satisfaction and also was the #1 preference to those people planning to buy smartphone in the next 90 days. And so it seems like there's a lot of great things and we feel absolutely fantastic about it.",1
"So those markets would have prepay, for example, lower purchasing power, indirect distribution. Are those things you are going to need to address through pricing and other means?",1
"Those markets that I mentioned that we were doing well in, there are some percentage of postpaid in some of those markets, but if you looked at the market in the aggregate, most of those markets are predominantly prepaid. In some cases, we've convinced someone to start a postpaid plan because in the long term, I think that's better for the customer, the carrier and us. But in general, we are also playing in the prepaid market. We're not avoiding that market. We don't want to avoid that market. We know that we need to play there in order to have the kind of volumes that we'd like to have. And in terms of your question on expanding channels and developing channels, we're obviously that is -- is on our list and with the 115,000 down now, we have some experience there. We know we've got a lot more to do, but we've got some experience under our belt now to play with.",1
"Tim, this is for you. Mac growth was about 5% sequential. In the past 2 years, the sequential growth has looked more like 17% to 18% and notebook sequential growth was even below that. So I wanted to go back to what do you think in this quarter was cannibalization versus perhaps some hold-backs in anticipation of Lion? And how does that show up you think in terms of catch-up in the September quarter?",1
"Yes. I really look more at year-over-year than I do sequential on the Mac. But I am going to get at your -- the answer to your question anyway. I think, first of all, I am proud of the numbers that we achieved. To grow at 14%, when the market is growing at 2.6%, doing 5x the rate of growth is certainly something to be proud of. However, in terms of why isn't the number higher than 14%, obviously, we always focus on that. No matter if the number was 42%, we would focus on that. I think there are 3 things that are the primary factor. And I don't want to try to quantify these for you, but I do want to list them and how we look at it. The first is, as I've said before, I think there were some cannibalization of new Mac by iPad. We shipped a record 9.2 billion iPads during the quarter, which is over 2x the number of Macs that we shipped. And it's clear that some customers chose to purchase an iPad instead of a new Mac. But the thing that really excites us is that more customers chose to buy an iPad than a Windows PC. The second one is, I think, some customers have delayed purchase until Lion becomes available. And as Peter commented on earlier, we are launching Lion tomorrow. And we're looking forward to getting Lion out. It's a fantastic product. The guys have worked very, very hard on it and it's really a revolutionary change. But the third thing that I wouldn't discount it, in the year ago quarter, we launched new MacBook Pro. In this particular quarter, we launched new iMac. Both products were well received, however, the MacBook Pro makes up over the majority of the units that we sell in the Mac area. And so obviously, if you change the MacBook Pro and it's well received, it's going to make the comp more difficult to compare to. And so those are the 3 things that I think are primarily why the number isn't more than it is. But I don't want to lose site that it is already is 5x the industry and this is the 21st consecutive quarter that we beat the market.",1
"My follow-up then is if I look at the sequential growth pattern in the September quarter, I would assume given the demand and as you said, you're catching up here in the month of July that iPads would increase sequentially, including probably some potential channel fill. But I just want to see if you could give us some feedback on what the growth trajectory look like after this great quarter here in iPads.",1
"Well, we don't predict unit sales. We aggregate things into a guidance and Peter went through that earlier. So I don't want to make a comment about iPad other than I think Peter said earlier, which I'm sure that you would have reached conclusion of anyways that we think iPad will grow significantly year-over-year. And we'll leave the rest of it to you to conclude and then we would be very happy to report in October how we did that.",1
"Okay. Just a follow-up question, any update on Apple TV and maybe some thoughts on your strategy in the connected TV markets?",1
"The iPhone clearly is gaining share, but comments from Google last week just said Android activations were up 56% quarter-over-quarter and by our math, it looks like iOS activations were up around 20%. Tim, you mentioned that China is on fire right now up 600%. Obviously, you're doing relatively well in emerging markets but any thoughts in terms of how do you think, I guess, about that Android activation number relative to your business?",1
"Great. And then if you could talk just a little bit about China. Clearly, your growth in Asia Pac was at almost 250% year-over-year, just any update on China?",1
"Hopefully, I didn't miss this, but can you give us a little more color on that one-time benefit in gross margins, how significant was it? And any color on what drove that?",1
"Yes. That's a good question. China was very key to our results. As a reminder, we define Greater China as Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Year-over-year, it was up over 6x and the revenue was approximately $3.8 billion during the quarter and that makes the year-to-date numbers through the 3 quarters that we've had thus far around $8.8 billion. And so this has been a substantial opportunity for Apple and I firmly believe that we're just scratching the surface right now. I think there is an incredible opportunity for Apple there.",1
"From Barclays Capital, Benjamin Reitzes.",1
"I wanted to talk a little bit more about the outlook for gross margin. You said 38% from the 41.7%. Can you talk about what components and/or mix dynamics will impact that, Peter?",1
"Sure. We expect the gross margin, Ben as you said, to be about 38% and down about 370 basis points sequentially. We expect about 2/3 of this decline to be driven by the different product mix and we expect the remainder to be due to the loss of leverage on the lower sequential revenue. The cost of the future product transition, a full quarter of the back-to-school promotion.",1
I guess the components aspect of that?,1
"Ben, it's Tim, both NAND and DRAM and also LCDs, batteries, optical drives and most of the components are generally in a very positive supply situation currently. And pricing is expected to fall at or above the historical trend. Hard drive supply is currently constrained. We project the price declines in this area will be less than the historical rates. We do expect therefore components to be favorable on a sequential comparison. However, this is largely being offset by one-time benefits that we receive that are embedded in the 41.7% gross margin that Peter talked about earlier in the June quarter. And therefore, not a part of the bridge that Peter just talked about.",1
"Sure. Bill, it's Peter. We saw some benefits in our warranty and phone support area and some settlements that we had. They weren't huge in the June quarter, but we did see some benefits there. And as Tim said, we see that generally offsetting, the reversal of that generally offsetting the component benefits that he just talked about in the September quarter.",1
"No, but I think you can see that it's something that is of great focus to us. We want to do business with great partners and there are still great partners out there to do business with, and so we're obviously off working new relationships.",1
"Okay. Great. And then a quick follow up. There's been a lot of news around patent disputes as of late, some seems to have gone in Apple's favor, while others haven't. Can you help us understand, Tim, how to put these events in context? How we should think about your IP strategy overall and perhaps how all this is potentially impacting the competitive landscape in smartphones and tablets?",1
"We have a very simple view here, and that view is, we love competition. We think it's great for us and for everyone. But we want people to invent their own stuff and we're going to make sure that we defend our portfolio perfectly.",1
Richard Gardner with Citigroup.,1
"Surprised nobody has asked it, but I was just hoping that you could provide a little more color on what drove the iPhone's strength in the quarter, was it new carriers or existing, new countries or existing? I know you've specifically referred to China as being a driver, but just a little more color on what you saw with iPhone in the quarter, please?",1
"Yes. Richard, it's Tim. It's a great question. We did add 42 new carriers and 15 new countries during the quarter, and so we continued our expansion efforts to get up beyond the 2.25 carrier number and above 100 countries. However, those occurred throughout the quarter and the real sequential improvement, frankly, was due to emerging and developed markets. China was a big part of it, Latin America driven by Brazil and Mexico was a big part of it, and the Middle East was a big part of it, which I think is great for Apple because these are markets that Apple historically has not been as strong and we're really beginning to see the fruits of our labor in these markets.",1
"And then, Tim, would you be willing to give us, as a follow-up, any sort of milestones that you're hoping to hit for the next quarter or 2 in terms of new carriers and countries for iPhone?",1
"Yeah, Bill, itâs Tim. First of all, at a global level, I think itâs important to understand as you compare our Q2 iPhone sales to Q3, there is a fairly large channel inventory difference that is embedded in that. As you recall, in January, we completed the iPhone 4S rollout in all the major countries, including China. It was our fastest iPhone rollout ever. We were also able to get the channel at a â within our target inventory range of four to six weeks by the end of March. And so what that did was, it increased sell in over sell through by 2.6 million units. In the quarter that we just finished, our sell in was less than sell through by 300,000 units. And so the net change in channel inventory across the quarter is about 3 million units. And so, I think itâs important to understand that to look at the underlying sell through trends.",1
"In terms of what we see happening in the different geographies, the U.S. was very strong, running at 47%, Japan was strong at 45%. Iâve already mentioned Greater China was up 66%, but Mainland China was over doubled as I said before, itâs over 100% up. The geography that did not perform well was Europe. Europe was essentially flat, slightly positive year-on-year and that really hampered our total results.",1
"Within Europe, now Iâll switch from iPhone to talking about more of the gross revenue level. We see a margin difference between the countries. The U.K. was relatively solid at 30% growth, but France and Greece and Italy were particularly poor, and Germany was also similarly a single-digit positive growth for the quarter. Eastern Europe was strong, materially stronger than Western Europe, but obviously the Western European countries drive the preponderance of the revenue in that segment. And so, weâre certainly seeing a slow down in business in that area. Fortunately, the U.S. and China, although I realize itâs getting a lot of crest, weâre not seeing anything that we would classify as an obvious economic issue.",1
"I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, revenue for the quarter was 4.1 billion approximately equal to the year ago quarter. The stores experienced strong growth in iPhone sales and have been most successful MacBook Air launch to-date.",1
"We continue to be very pleased with the growth and the strength of the Apple ecosystem. With the broadest geographic reach and depth of content in the industry, our iTunes Stores generated record billings of $4.3 billion in the June quarter culminating in our best months and best week ever for App Store billings at the very end of the quarter. The quarterâs iTunes billings translated to quarterly revenue of $2.4 billion, up 29% from the year ago quarter with strong growth in revenue in both content and apps. The continued strong iTunes sales combined with other software and service revenue resulted in total quarterly revenue of $4 billion from iTunes software and services. We added some great new video content to iTunes and Apple TV.",1
"Last month we announced HBO GO and WatchESPN are now available directly on Apple TV joining programming from Hulu Plus, Netflixâs streaming catalog, live sports from MLB, NBA and NHL as well as Internet content from Vimeo, YouTube and Flickr. Sky News, Crunchyroll and Qello are offering live news, sports and current TV programming. Apple TV users can now choose from a broad selection of programming including over 60,000 movies and over 230,000 TV episodes as well as the worldâs largest collection of music on the iTunes Store.",1
"iTunes users have downloaded more than 1 billion TV episodes and 390 million movies from iTunes to-date, and they are purchasing over 800,000 TV episodes and over 350,000 movies per day. We recently celebrated the five year anniversary of our amazing app store. Our developers have now created more than 900,000 iOS apps including 375,000 apps made for iPad. The popularity of these apps remains incredibly strong.",1
"Cumulative app downloads have surpassed 50 billion and app developers have made over $11 billion for their sales through the App Store half of which was earned in the last four quarters. Our vibrant ecosystem continues to drive tremendous user engagement with our devices and services and we now have over 320 million iPod accounts and 240 million Game Center accounts and our customers have sent almost 900 billion iMessages, uploaded over a 125 billion photos and received over 8 trillion push notifications. And thanks to the stability and security and popularity of the iOS platform, the iOS devices continue to have a strong lead over Android in the enterprise.",1
"In its most recently published quarterly enterprise device activations report, the technology is found that among its corporate clients iPhone 5 was by far the most frequently updated device of any kind and iPadâs represent 88% of all tablet activations. Weâre continuing to invest in software and services to make the ecosystem and user experience even richer. This fall we will release a beta version of iWork for iCloud bringing pages, numbers and keynotes to the web. With iWork for iCloud users will be able to create great looking letters, reports and flyers, generate complex yet beautiful spreadsheets and develop and deliver beautiful presentations with powerful graphics and special effects all from within a web browser.",1
"And weâre extremely excited about the fall launch of iOS 7 with its stunning new user interface and many great new features including control center, AirDrop and iTunes Radio, smarter multi-tasking and enhancements to notification center, photos, Safari and Siri.",1
We opened six new stores across five countries during the quarter and end of the quarter with a total of 408 stores including a 156 outside of United States. We expect over nine new stores in the September quarter getting us to a total of 27 new store openings in fiscal 13. We also relocated four stores in the June quarter that had outgrown their former space and we expect to complete and total of 23 such relocations in fiscal â13. With an average of 405 stores opened in the June average revenue per store was 10.1 million compared to 11.1 million in the year ago quarter.,1
"We were excited to release to developer preview of OS X Mavericks last month. More than 200 new features, OS - with more than 200 new features, OS X Mavericks brings Maps and iBooks to the Mac, introduces Finder Tags and Tabs, enhances multi-display support for power users, delivers new core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and performance, and includes an all-new version of Safari. OS X Mavericks will be available to customers in the fall. We ended the quarter with just below our 4 to 5 week target range of Mac channel inventory.",1
"Retail segment income was 667 million; we hosted 84 million visitors to our stores during the quarter this translates to 16,000 visitors per store per week. Operating expenses were 3.8 billion and included 488 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&E was 234 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26.9%. And turning to our cash we ended the quarter with a 146.6 billion in cash plus short term and long term marketable securities compared to a 144.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of 1.9 billion. A 106 billion of our total cash was offshored at the end of the June quarter and cash flow from operations with 7.8 billion. In early April we concluded the 1.95 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in December quarter resulted in cumulative retirement of over 4 million shares of Apple stock under that program.",1
"In late April we executed a very successful debt offering issuing 17 billion of debt across 3, 5, 10 and 30 year maturities. We paid 2.8 billion in dividends in the quarter and we also utilized a total of 16 billion in cash on share repurchase activity through a combination of a new accelerated share repurchase program and open market purchases. 12 billion of the 16 billion was utilized under a new ASR program initiated with two financial institutions in April.",1
"An initial delivery of 23.5 million shares was made under this program with the final number of shares delivered in average price per share to be determined at the conclusion of the program, based on the volume weighted average purchase price of Appleâs stock over the program period, which will conclude in fiscal â14. In addition to the new ASR, we executed 4 billion of open market share repurchases, resulting in the retirement of 9 million additional shares. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share payable on August 15, 2013, the shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 12, 2013.",1
"Now, as we move ahead into the March quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $34 billion and $37 billion compared to $36 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 36% and 37% reflecting approximately $90 billion related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $3.9 billion and $3.95 billion, including about $495 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.5%.",1
"In closing, we are pleased with our record June quarter iPhone sales, the strong growth in revenue from iTunes software and services, and the continued enhancement and popularity of our tremendously vibrant ecosystem. We are very excited about the upcoming releases of the stunning new iOS 7 in OS X Mavericks, and we are very hard at work on some amazing new products that we will introduce in the fall in across 2014.",1
"And with that, Iâd like to open the call to questions.",1
"Our U.S. education institution business had a great quarter generating its highest quarterly revenue ever. The results were fueled by all-time record quarterly iPad sales of 1.1 million units in addition to strong June quarter Mac sales. The state of Maineâs Learning Technology Initiative, which provides the stateâs little school and high school students and teachers with personal computing solutions allowed individual school districts to choose which products to purchase rather than standardized on a single statewide solution. We are very proud that an estimated 94% of the 69,000 total units selected this year were Apple products. And we are extremely pleased to have received the Los Angeles School Board of Educationâs unanimous approval to begin the first phase of a massive rollout of iPads to students across the district starting this fall. The district is the second largest in the United States and plans to equip every one of its 660,000 students with a tablet by 2014.",1
"Turning to Mac, we are pleased with sales of 3.8 million Macs, which is a 7% decline from the year ago quarter, but higher than our expectations. IDC estimates that the global personal computer market contracted by 11% during the June quarter, indicating that Macs gained share. In June, we introduced two new versions of MacBook Air and customer response has been great. Wired magazine described the new 13-inch MacBook Air as nearly flawless citing its phenomenal battery life, processing performance, feather-light chassis, and super-fast WiFi. Additionally, last month, we provided a sneak-peek at our next generation Mac Pro engineered around the workstation graphics with dual GPUs, PCI Express-based flash storage, high-performance Thunderbolt 2, next generation Xeon processors, ultra-fast memory and support for 4-K video. The new state-of-the-art Mac Pro will be assembled in the U.S. and will be available later this year.",1
"Katy, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect our gross margins to be between 36% and 37%, which is consistent with what we expected in the June quarter. And on a sequential basis, that would mean that gross margin would be largely flat to slightly down. We are on track to have a very busy fall. I would like to leave it there and go into more detail on October.",1
"As for the details of the quarter, Iâd like to begin with iPhone. We sold 31.2 million iPhones compared to 26 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 5.2 million, or 20%. We had a sequential decrease of about 600,000 iPhones in channel inventory in the June quarter translating to iPhone sell-through of about 31.8 million units. iPhone sales were ahead of our expectations and we were particularly pleased with very strong year-over-year growth in iPhone sales in a number of both developed and emerging markets including the U.S., UK, Japan, Brazil, Russia, India, Thailand and Singapore. iPhone 5 remains by far the most popular iPhone but we were also happy with sales of iPhone 4 and 4s. We exited the quarter with about 11 million units of total iPhones in channel inventory and ended within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory.",1
"Please standby, we are about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, maâam.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Appleâs CFO, Peter Oppenheimer and he will be joined by CEO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information youâll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, future products and capital allocation plans. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Appleâs Form 10-K for 2012, the Form 10-Q for the second quarter of the 2013 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. We are pleased to report the results of our third fiscal quarter. We established a new June quarter record for iPhone sales driving Appleâs strongest June quarter revenue ever.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $35.3 billion, up $300 million or 1% from the year ago quarter, and at the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 36.9% also at the high end of our guidance range, and operating margin was $9.2 billion representing 26% of revenue. Net income was $6.9 billion translating to the diluted earnings per share of $7.47. Channel inventories declined sequentially by $1 billion during the June quarter this year meaning that sell-through was $36.3 billion. In contrast, channel inventory increased $700 million from the beginning to the end of the June quarter last year meaning that sell-through was $34.3 billion in that quarter. As such, our June quarter sell-through increased by $2 billion, or 6% year-over-year ahead of our 1% [selling and] [ph] revenue growth.",1
"iPhone unit sales in the U.S. increased 51% compared to the year ago quarter and based on research recently published by comScore, iPhone once again achieved the number one spot in the U.S. smartphone market for the three months period ended in May with over 39% share. iPhone sales were also very strong in Japan growing [66%] [ph] year-over-year. iPhone is the top selling smartphone in Japan based on the latest published quarterly data from IDC and Apple is the number one or number two selling smartphone manufacturer in most markets IDC tracks including North America, Western Europe, Russia, Turkey, Australia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.",1
"In every major industry around the world companies are developing, deploying and supporting apps for iPad. Government organizations as well as global enterprise companies across diverse fields including automotive, insurance, energy services and healthcare are using iPad and custom apps to create unique meaningful experiences for their employees, partners, and customers. The USDAâs National Agricultural Statistics Service has deployed thousands of iPads to in-person interviewers resulting in higher response rates and decreased cost. And companies including Eli Lilly, Novartis, Cathay Life, Roche, and SAP have deployed over 20,000 iPads each across their organizations.",1
"The most recently published study by Kantar measured at 93% loyalty rate among iPhone owners significantly higher than our competitors. And iPhone continues to lead in terms of customer experience. Not only has iPhone earned the top spot in customer satisfaction from J.D. Power and Associates, an unprecedented nine consecutive times it has also received the top customer satisfaction ranking in a number of surveys including the recent Quality Insights survey of smartphone customers in South Korea. iPhone also continues to be the smartphone of choice for business. Given the security and stability of iOS, enterprise and government customers around the world continue to deploy iPhone on their network in ways that go far beyond personal productivity.",1
"Companies have built tens of thousands of custom apps to improve every aspect of their business. Global companies including American Airlines, Cisco, General Electric, Roche and SAP have deployed more than 25,000 iPhones each across their organizations. U.S. government organizations such NASAâs Jet Propulsion Lab, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the ATF and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency are supporting and managing thousands of iPhones on their networks and continue to create both customer facing and internal iOS apps.",1
"And just this past quarter iOS 6 was granted FIPS 140-2 validation by the U.S. federal government and approval by the U.S. Department of Defense to connect to their networks. Combining sales to business, government and education customers, iPhone holds a 62.5% share of the U.S. commercial market based on the latest quarterly data published by IDC.",1
"Turning to iPad we sold 14.6 million iPads during the quarter compared to 17 million in the year ago quarter. The tough year-over-year comparison was driven by both the significant channel inventory increase and the first full quarter of the availability of the third generation iPad in the year ago quarter. We built 1.2 million units of iPad channel inventory in the June quarter last year whereas we reduced channel inventory by 700,000 units in the June quarter this year.",1
"Factoring in this 1.9 million unit channel inventory swing, iPad unit sell-through was down 3% year-over-year. We exited the quarter with about 4.1 million units of iPad channel inventory within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks.",1
"Customers continue to love their iPads, for the second consecutive time in the two year history of a survey, iPad ranked number one in the 2013 U.S. tablet satisfaction survey by J.D. Power and Associates and again in its latest study published today [Chitika] [ph] reported that iPad accounted for 84.3% share of tablet web usage by customers in the U.S. and Canada, its highest level this year.",1
"Yes, thanks. Peter, as you mentioned in the press release today, new products will ship this fall, and historically, gross margins do come down in a product transition quarter, but thatâs not reflected in your outlook, so can you talk about why this product cycle might be different?",1
"Okay. As a follow-up, can you talk about of why you think channel inventory came down more than seasonally this quarter and also inventory on your balance sheet was up significantly, is that a direct result of the channel wanting to hold back inventory?",1
"Brian, we try very hard to keep our product roadmap secret and confidential, and we go to extreme, do extreme activities to try to do that. That however doesnât stop people from speculating or wondering and weâll never do that. And so itâs a great thing about this country, people can say what they think and so forth. And so I'm not going to spend any energy trying to change that, thatâs just the environment we are in. Iâm glad that people want the next thing. Iâm super happy about it. And there is obviously, quite a few that what weâre currently doing as well and as witnessed by the amount of products that weâre selling. And so, Iâm not going to put any energy into try to get people to stop speculating. I donât think it would â I donât think thatâs going to amount anything.",1
No Iâm not opposed to it. I see channels doing it and I like the environmental aspect of it and so that part of it really is encouraging today.,1
"And notably absent from that list was China, was that was your pricing how you treated to change pricing this quarter relative to previous quarters any different in China than the rest of the world?",1
"China was weaker in the quarter, although the datasheet that obviously focuses on revenue doesnât really tell the complete story here. If you look at sell-through as we have mentioned earlier with the inventory changes, itâs important to do that. And so our sell-through in China was only down 4% from the year ago quarter when you normalized for channel inventory. Hong Kong was actually down more significantly. Mainland China was actually up year-over-year. It was up 5%, but that is the lower growth rate than we have been seeing and are attributed to many things including the economy there clearly doesnât help us or nor others. In Hong Kong, Hong Kong is an international shopping haven as you know for not only tourist but also some resellers and we saw more dramatic downturn there, it's not totally clear exactly what had occurred but it was down on a sell through basis by about 20% so that weighed greater China down as you can see in your data sheet.",1
Thank you Tony. Can we have the next question please?,1
"The question that I wanted ask was with regard to, there's been a lot of talk about a trade-in program that you guys are going to start even doing on your own with regard iPhoneâs, is there any update on that, and if so is that something that could help margins and help expand your emerging market sales and how is that going to work? Thanks.",1
Ben we haven't announced anything relative to a trade-in program so what youâve seen is rumor oriented. There are a number of channels that do trade-in programs now not only in the U.S. but in different regions and the reason that it's so attractive around iPhone is that the residual value of an iPhone stay so high and there is so much demand for it and so that makes the trade-in programs more lucrative to a win-win from many points of view. But we haven't announced anything about us.,1
Are you opposed to it?,1
"Okay, then really quick on China you answered some of it in the question before but how do we turn it around here, China and other APAC, what can we do to make it turn, you know there has been some press in China that obviously you had to deal with and when do we see that market turning and even though investors are worried about it from a secular point of view as well as the economy there.",1
"We were down 4% year-over-year on the iPhone ASP about $27, and that was primarily due to the mix of the products that we are selling and FX headwinds. As we anticipated iPhone 4 sales accelerated as we offered more affordable pricing in emerging and other markets, so thatâs on a year-over-year basis. And then sequentially, it was down about $32, and again, that was driven by mix as well in part iPhone 4. Tim, do you want make comments about what we may have seen in the regions?",1
I think it's important to put in perspective. If you combine the stores (ph) that we have in Greater China our revenues there were 4.9 billion for the quarter and so that 14% powered the company which is very significant and in a few years that was in 100s of millions and so we have run our business there significantly.,1
"We have a very strong market there and in the last 12 months we have done 27 billion on a trailing basis and so it's a huge business for us. Underlying the results are, if you look at iPad sell through in greater China was up 8% but the sell through in Mainland China was up 37% and so iPad is doing remarkably well. The latest share numbers we have seen on iPad for the tablet market is over 50% and year-to-date iPad units are up 48% year-over-year and so there have been direct growth there.",1
"From an ecosystem point of view we continue to attract a lot of developers from China. We now have about a 0.5 million developers in China that are working on iOS apps and thatâs up almost 70% year-over-year and so I think thatâs in top economy (ph) for China but for outside of China is many offered their apps through, in different stores around the world. Weâre obviously paying the developers quite a bit and so thatâs furthering advancement of the ecosystem of developers. Weâre continuing to invest in distribution, weâre going to double the number of retail stores there for the next two years and weâre continuing to lift iPhone point of sales and iPad sales both of which are currently lower than where we would them or need them today but weâre doing that very cautiously with what we want to do with great quality. And so I continue to believe that in the arc of time here, China is a huge opportunity for Apple and I donât get discouraged over a 90-day cycle that can have economic factors and other things in it.",1
Thanks Ben. Can we have the next question please?,1
"Good afternoon. You talked about more affordable pricing and Peter, can you just confirm that, that was just with the iPhone 4 and then separately as you think about the growth that you had in some of these emerging markets, it sounds like some more recently it has come from affordable pricing, but also you potentially could address those markets in products that are more appropriate for those markets? And maybe can you just talk from a very high level just how you think about, are those both levers that you potentially could use or do you feel that pricing is the lever? And then a follow-up question.",1
"Gene, itâs Tim. The reference that Peter made earlier was to the iPhone 4 and what we have seen is that the number of first-time smartphone buyers that the iPhone 4 is attracting is very, very impressive. And we want to attract as many of these buyers as we can. And we saw that beginning to happen towards the end of the Q2 timeframe as I have referenced on last quarterâs call and we did that on a wider spread basis offered the more affordable pricing on a wider scale basis this quarter and continued to be very happy with what we saw and where iPhone 5 continues to be the most popular iPhone by far, we are really happy to provide an incredible high-quality product with iPhone 4 running iOS 6 to as many first-time smartphone buyers as we can. And I think itâs proven to be exactly a great product for that buyer.",1
"Yes, sure. From an iPhone point of view, Toni, with the moves that we made on 4 and with iPhone 5 continuing to be the most popular model we saw very strong sales in several of the emerging markets or prepaid markets. India was up over 400%. Turkey and Poland were both up over 60%. The Philippines were up about 140%. And in addition, we saw very strong iPhone sales in several of the developed markets. For example, the U.S. was up over 50%, Japan up over 60%, the UK about 50%, and so we had several regions, where iPhone growth actually accelerated from the previous quarter, which is a unusual pattern for us and we were very, very happy with this.",1
"Okay. The second one I was wondering whether you could comment on was just iPhone ASPs, they were down about 5% sequentially or down about 10% over the last two quarters. I presume thatâs principally due to a higher mix of 4s and 4Ss, but I was wondering if you could comment on whatâs driving that change in ASP and whether itâs more pronounced in certain geographies versus others?",1
"Katy, I will take the balance sheet part of your question and Tim can talk about the channel.",1
"Okay, great. And then on the iPad side of the equation. Looking at sell through decline this quarter obviously ex the channel inventory dynamics, should we think of this as more of a pause within your customer base ahead of your next refresh as we see in the past or is there a broader industry dynamic at play within tablets that could contribute to that.",1
"The inventory on the balance sheet was really up for two reasons. First, we have got more storage this year than we had last. So, our finished goods inventory was a part of the inventory increase and then our components inventory was up as well.",1
"Katy, itâs Tim. From an iPad point of view, or iPad and iPhone, we reduced inventory, and reduced it fairly significantly. iPad was down over 700,000 units in the beginning of the quarter and iPhone was down over 600. As you know from working with us over several quarters, we typically donât like to have any more inventory than we need. And so if we can find a way to reduce, we do so. And we have done that in both of these cases. We also have slight decreases in the Macintosh area and on iPod.",1
"From Goldman Sachs, we will go to Bill Shope.",1
"Okay, great. Thanks. I have a bit of a longer term question. Despite the fairly substantial iPhone upside this quarter, there has been increasing concerns at the high-end of the smartphone markets reaching a saturation point and that growth may be harder to come by for really for all vendors. Whatâs your perspective on that and the current industry dynamics? And Tim, do you think there are new innovations and services in the pipeline that can reinvigorate the premium segment of the market after whatâs obviously been a bit tough 2013 to that segment, to the industry.",1
"Well from a growth point of view for Apple our key catalysts will be, always will be new products and new services and these are above in existing categories that weâre in and in new categories. In addition to this we have opportunities and distribution from carrier relationships to expanding our retail stores, expanding our online store and continuing to expand the indirect channel and we also have a market expansion opportunity, Peter mentioned enterprise in his comments and the share positions that we have there over 60% in both iPad and iPhone and I think weâre at the very front end of that and so I think we have lots of growth opportunities.",1
And I don't subscribe to the common view that the higher end if you will of the smartphone market is at its peak. I donât believe that but we will see and we will report our result as we go along.,1
"For us if you look year-over-year. We had 2.4 million unit decline but 80% of that or 1.9 million units were just due to changes in channel inventory. As I think Peter referenced earlier, we reduced by over 700 in the current quarter and the year ago quarter had an increase of 1.2 and so the underlying sell through declined by just 3%. If you look at the situation that weâre in in the year ago quarter we had just announced the third-generation iPad which was our first iPad with a retina display. We had announced in March and so that was our first full quarter and so from what Peter and I expected 90 days ago we hit within the midpoint of the range that we expected to hit on iPad unit sales and so it was not a surprise to us.",1
"Well we had some puts and takes within the quarter, but it was â it ultimately ended up within the range that we thought it would be and we hit the high end.",1
"In terms of how other people are doing, I don't know. What I can tell you is that most recent data I have gotten which actually just came out I believe this morning is that the iPad Web share data shows that through the quarter we accelerated further and are now, iPad accounts for 84% of the web traffic from tablets which is absolutely incredible and so if there are lots of other tablets selling I don't know what they are being used for because thatâs a pretty, the basic function is web browser.",1
"We feel really good about where we are. Peter had mentioned earlier we had an incredible quarter in U.S. education setting a new record for iPad. Weâre really happy to be selected for the first phase of 660,000 unit roll out at LA Unified and really bold move they are making to change teaching and learning and we had double-digit unit growth in China, for iPad in Japan, in Canada, in Latin America, in Russia, in the Middle East and in India and so weâre really happy with what we saw.",1
"From Sanford Bernstein, we will go to Toni Sacconaghi.",1
"I was wondering if you could provide some kind of gross margin bridge sequentially, I think last quarter you had about a 90 basis point one time impact from the China warranty accrual. So if we adjust for that gross margins were down about a 150 basis points sequentially, and the mix of products was relatively similar to last quarter given that youâre also riding the experience curve in these products, I was surprised given the mix that gross margins were as down as much sequentially as they were. Can you provide a bridge on a sequential basis on what happened with gross margins?",1
"Sure. First of all, let me say, we are very pleased with gross margin in the quarter at 36.9%. It was at really the high end of the range that we provided of 36% to 37%. And the sequential decline was not a surprise to us. We understood the warranty effects in March. And as I said on last quarterâs call, we expect that our margins to be down sequentially primarily for two reasons. The first is the lower sequential revenue, so we lost leverage going from March to June, and we expected a different product mix. And as you can see, we reported very near the top end of that and feel good.",1
"Right, but Peter, the mix ultimately was not that different I think iPhones were 52.5% last quarter, they were 51.5%. So, it actually seems like your mix was perhaps better than you had anticipated. So, I appreciate the volume revenue mix, but was your mix exactly in line with what you expected?",1
"Thanks, Brian. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks as a Podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on Apple.com/investor and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820; and please enter confirmation code 1260435. These replays will be available by approximately 5:30 PM Pacific Time today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling; he is at 408-974-1896. And financial analysts can contact either Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570 and Iâm at 408-974-5420. And thanks again for joining us.",1
"Thanks. And then, when you think about how the iPhone has penetrated the planet, obviously, weâve had some pretty phenomenal success, and some of that success, thereâs been some downside to that as well with respect to volatility about the rumors and speculation about kind of future products being announced. And so, could you talk a little bit about how you try to manage sort of the iPhone transitions and the carrier ramp as well, I mean obviously, you mentioned not going to be launching any major countries or carriers in the September quarter, but itâs widely speculated that weâre going to see something later on in the year. So if you can talk a little bit about how you kind of manage that whole sort of transition/carrier ramp up that would be great? Thank you.",1
Bill Shope â Goldman Sachs,1
"Toni, the specific data that youâve quoted, the 70% doesnât match to what Iâve seen, but let me try to answer your general question without that specific. Weâve been very focused, as you know on China, because we see it as an enormous opportunity for us. And Iâm very pleased that we were able to grow our iPhone sales over a 100% last quarter. And so, yes, I feel very, very good about that, and I firmly believe that people in the emerging markets wonât great products like they do in developed markets and so forth. And so weâre going to stick to our knitting and make the best products. And we think that if we do that, weâve got a very, very good business ahead of us. So, thatâs what we are doing.",1
"Next, weâll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.",1
"Yes, thank you. I have one for Peter and one for Tim, please. Peter, you talked about how you were above expectations relative to your guidance on iPhone, and you also mention you were above expectations on iPod, and you said you were thrilled iPad, yet your EPS I think came in 5% or 6% above your guidance. So perhaps you can help us illustrate where you were disappointed to relative to your original guidance, because I think the commentary would certainly point to a much larger beat?",1
"Toni, look, given whatâs going on around us, we are happy with our quarter. Sales of each of our products did exceed what we had factored into the guidance. That was especially true of the iPad, which set a new record at 17 million units, and the $35 billion of revenue that we reported grew by $6.5 billion year-over-year. We do think some things did this in the quarter, so let me comment on that. The economy in Europe is not doing well. We think this impacted our results. We also saw some economic impact in the natural resource space economies, including Australia, Brazil and Canada.",1
"As Tim discussed regarding iPhone, weâre reading the same rumors and speculation that you are about a new iPhone, and we think this has caused some pause in customers purchasing. The timing of availability of Intelâs Ivy Bridge and resulting rumors about the new portables impacted our sales in April and May. Tim talked about how after WDC we saw a large increase in sales both in terms of weekly sales before WDC and on a year-over-year basis, and customers are loving the new MacBook Pro. and we did not get the benefit of launching the new iPad in China or the new portables as we are pursuing routine regulatory approval.",1
"and finally, the dollar strengthened against most currencies around the world, which reduced our revenue growth sequentially by over $200 million net of our hedges. So, we think these things impacted the quarter. Weâre happy very with how the business is performing and are excited about our new product pipeline.",1
"Thank you for that. Tim, the question that I had for you is, whether you could talk a little bit about smartphone growth in emerging markets. China is obviously the biggest one. Some of the data that Iâve seen suggest that about 70% of the smartphones that are being purchased in places like China and other emerging countries are under $300, and in many cases under $200. Do you agree with that market characterization, and at some point does that become a limit â does that limit your ability to gain share in a marketplace where its 70% of the units are at a price point that you currently donât play in? At what point does that math prevent you from gaming share, and what are your strategies for ensuring continued share going forward, if indeed thatâs an objective?",1
"And the share objected in and of itself is not an explicit one Tim, thatâs a consequence of making good products that either happens or it doesnât or is that an explicit objective for the iPhone business on a global basis and on an emerging markets basis?",1
"We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $12.9 billion and $13.1 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative [indiscernible] impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on August 11, 2022, to shareholders of record as of August 8, 2022. With that, let's open the call to questions.",1
"I wouldnât go historic for the company in total, so itâs not just iPhone, but across everything that we make is to make the very best product, and thatâs more important, and overshadows all other things. But we do believe by doing that, that we will have a great business, and I think that our results today really show that.",1
"Thanks, Toni. Could we have our next question, please?",1
"From Pacific Crest, weâll go to Andy Hargreaves.",1
"Hi. Just first clarification, is the channel inventory commentary on a look forward basis?",1
You are talking about the week Andy?,1
"Yeah, correct.",1
"Thank you, Shannon. Could we have our next question, please?",1
"From the carrierâs perspective, I think itâs also important to remember that the total subsidy that they pay is fairly small relative to the monthly payments they collect over a 24-month contract period. And I think many would tell you, they certainly told to me, that iPhone has several advantages for them over other smartphones, the churn rates are much less, you see carriers now focusing on shared data plans and I think an iPhone customer is likely more â is more likely to have a Tablet or an iPad. And so I think they really value these customers quite a bit.",1
"Yeah, okay. So then the comments on iPad being just slightly within the range of four to six weeks, which seem to imply a fairly significant slowdown sequentially in sell through, can you comment on whatâs driving that expectation?",1
"Ben, I think there is a lot of speculation out there. Itâs difficult to sort out, but Iâm fairly convinced based on what Iâve seen that there is an incredible anticipation out there for future products and as you would expect given what weâve been able to deliver in the past. And so I think itâs a reasonable amount. In terms of channel inventory in the current quarter, we put our current thinking in the guidance that Peter provided to you.",1
"Okay, very helpful. Thank you.",1
"Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question please.",1
Next weâll go to Ben Reitzes with Barclays.,1
"Yeah, thanks a lot. My first question, I wanted to ask about the fall transition you mentioned, Peter, when you are talking about gross margin. Can you talk a little bit about that, what is the sequential impact on margins and revenue that youâre baking in and then qualitatively how much would you get back in the December quarter or how much of itâs short-term?",1
"Okay. Ben, I donât want to frustrate you or others, but the fall transition that I spoke about is driving most of the decline that we see sequentially in gross margin. Itâs not something that weâre going to talk about in any level of detail today and we could not be more confident in our new product pipeline.",1
"Okay. Just with regard to the iPhone in general, you mentioned there were speculation about new products and rumors, but do you have any quantification of how much that hurt sales in the quarter either from you or Tim, and how much that maybe channel inventory reduction youâll need to do in the next quarter maybe resulting from that type of speculation?",1
"Thanks, Ben. Could we have next question please.",1
"Let me avoid talking about the product transition, but youâre very smart to ask that. I don't want to get into specific topics about with different carriers, but generally I would just say that our role is to make the very best smartphone in the world and that has an incredible user experience far superior than anything else that customers want to use everyday. And I think at the end of the day, the carriers want to buy or want to provide their customers with â what their customers want to buy. And so the most important thing for Apple by far is to continue making the best products in the world and we are very deeply committed to doing this and weâre maniacally focused on it.",1
Next weâll hear from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"Thank you very much. Can you talk a bit about the Mac business, I mean it was up 2% year-over-year, clearly still outperforming the market, but can you talk about what youâre seeing how much of the slower growth was from say the product transition versus weak economy and then any thoughts on cannibalization of Mac by the iPad?",1
"Shannon, itâs Tim. Itâs clear the PC market is weak based on the latest IDC data, but frankly we believe the primary factor for our lower growth rate in the Mac area is the timing of our portable announcement within last quarter. As you know, we announced an entirely new portable line up thatâs been incredibly well received. That was done with three weeks or less than three weeks remaining in the quarter. The year ago compare we made the transition in the portable area in February and so we were selling our new line up for the entire Q3 period.",1
"And so, if you look at the data underneath that to further illustrate this, prior to the Developers Conference, our weekly Mac sales were running below the prior year. After the Developers Conference, the MacBook Pros and the MacBook Airs drove year-over-year increases in weekly sell through. And they were to the level that got us back to an overall positive territory for the quarter and our 25 consecutive quarter of growing faster than the market. The MacBook Pro with the Retina display was incredibly well received, we ended the quarter in backlog, and we still have not caught up with demand yet, but anticipate doing so next month.",1
"Also to further illustrate the portable point, for the month of June, the NPD data that just came out for the United States showed our portable share at 25.5% and a record 47% of revenue share in the month of June. And so, I would attribute a large amount to what has happened in terms of the timing of our portable announcement.",1
"Okay, great. And then could you talk a little bit, Tim, about what your conversations are like with the carriers in terms of pricing, subsidies, there's been a lot of talk about that over the last few months. So just how are your discussions with the carriers going clearly into the product transition thatâs coming?",1
"The week that we quote are forward-looking looking, because inventory is in the channel for forward sales.",1
"Keep in mind that the channel inventory is only for the indirect channel. But, itâs not used for to support any direct sales, and direct sales are Apple retail sales, Apple online sales, Apple education sales. And so, I donât want to give you a specific guidance on iPad sales. Itâs important to keep that in mind, and thatâs just not the case with iPad, but itâs the case with all products. I know that there are some companies out there they refer to their channel inventory in terms of their gross sales, but we donât do that, because we feel very strongly that it only supports the channel sales, so thatâs how we calculate it.",1
"Now, when we can do that and hit more aggressive price points, weâre also going to do that. And I think youâve seen that with what we did with the $399 iPad, just a few months ago. And the iPhone 3GS is free in the United States, and in several other countries. And there has been quite a lot knocked off the price of that in certain other markets. And so, our North Star that will be making the best products in the world, and thatâs why we breathe, thatâs why we live and weâre not changing that.",1
"Shaw, itâs Tim. We factored supply into the guidance that Peter has given you. Generally, I should say that we have been short of the MacBook Pro with the Retina displays, we ended the quarter with backlog and we are working really hard to deliver those to customers quickly and we believe that we will be in supply and demand balance in August.",1
"Thanks very much. I wanted to follow-up on the pricing question and as specifically around the iPad as to whether or not you think the lower price point drove elasticity of demand for that product, in other words, were your sales incrementally higher or as a result of this economic environment, did you see customers migrate down market to lower-priced products, because spending is a little tighter these days?",1
"Chris, itâs Tim. The reason that we did it was because we believed that the sales would be incrementally larger that there was price elasticity and that there was a buyer that really wanted the best product and that needed it to be a little less expensive, and so I believe that we saw that. I think it did help our sales. I think itâs particularly helping in K-12. The adoption rate of iPad in education is something Iâd never seen from any technology product in history. Usually, education tends to be a fairly conservative institution in terms of buying or K-12 does and weâre not seeing that at all on the iPad. And so I think it was â itâs been a big help for us and I am really glad that we did it.",1
"And just a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the opportunity that you see in India. A few years back, you talked about initial investments in China, and having cracked the China code, why hasnât Apple been more successful in India, and what is your outlook for growth in that geography specifically going forward?",1
"You know of course I love India, but I believe that Apple has some higher potential in the intermediate term in some other countries. And that doesnât mean that weâre not putting emphasis in India, we are. We have a business there, that business is growing, but the sort of the multilayer distribution there really adds to the cost of getting products to market. And so, weâre going to continue putting some energies there, but my own perspective is that in the intermediate term there will be larger opportunities outside of there.",1
"From Sterne, Agee, we will hear from Shaw Wu.",1
Okay. Thanks for having on. Just a quick question in terms of component availability particularly new components? Thanks.,1
"In terms of new products, I obviously donât talk about new products nor the parts that are in them, and so itâs sort of a limit to what I can say there other than anything that we know about, weâve obviously included in the guidance and if we were short of something, you can bet that we would all be spending our energies on trying to mitigate that.",1
"Yeah. I wouldnât want to comment specifically on that point, but Passbook in general is a very key feature. I think all of us have found that we were getting many passes and many tickets and so forth, they were scattered all over â maybe boarding passes, et cetera, they were scattered all over our iPhones in different apps. And so Passbook does an incredible job of pulling all of those to one place whether itâs offers or passes or tickets or whatever it might be. And so itâs a important feature of iOS 6 and I would want to speculate about where it might take us.",1
"Okay. Thanks for that color. Just a follow up on, I don't know if you could talk about in terms of the new iPad with the Retina display, I donât know, any constraints there?",1
"The iPad, the new iPad ended the quarter in just over the four-week line, which we associated with our target of four to six weeks and â in terms of channel inventory. Now that said, as a reminder, we did not ship the new iPad in Mainland China until the quarter that weâre now and in Q4, but in Q3, we feel like we ended in a balanced situation.",1
"Last, could we have the next question, please?",1
And that will come from Brian Marshall with ISI.,1
"Great, thanks guys. Clearly Apple's design philosophy has been about building great products as opposed to kind of going in the market, hitting certain price points. But how do you think about the opportunities to address maybe some of those opportunities that are down at some of those lower price points, with your existing products without essentially compromising the core features that basically make Appleâs products great.",1
"Brian, itâs Tim. Our North Star is to maniacally focus on making the worldâs best products and economic turmoil, may push us side to side, but weâre going to stay on that journey and stay focused on making the best product, and not deviate from that. Weâve seen, again and again throughout the years, that during these type of periods are where we distanced ourselves further from people that donât innovate and it increases the gap between us, and so thatâs what weâre focused on.",1
"Thanks Mark. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"Okay, thank you, Peter for that. Tim, I want to shift gears longer-term. You talked earlier about hobbies and their relevance, what about Passbook, Iâm not trying to imply that itâs a hobby, but could Passbook be perceived as kind of a stepping stone to Apple, have any greater role in a digital wallet in terms of the structure?",1
"Okay, thanks. And then just youâve obviously talked a fair amount of pricing umbrellas in the past, and on the iPhone side, if you donât think to address that. How are you thinking about that now on the iPad side? Now that there is some slightly higher quality competition like the Nexus 7 at lower price points?",1
"Yes, sure. Gene, weâre seeing, with an 84% Op year-over-year, weâre seeing triple-digit growth rates in many, many geographies. Generally speaking, the international markets in the aggregate are extremely strong, in the triple-digits internationally. The U.S. is a bit lower, but I think it's important to keep in mind that the U.S. was on a faster adoption curve with iPad. And so weâre thrilled with the numbers everywhere. Latin America is tripling. Weâre seeing growth out of the countries that are a bit border on being shocking in terms of the growth rate. We would not have dreamed of shipping over 17 million last quarter, and feel very, very good about it.",1
"We re-priced the iPad 2 to $399, and it did very well in the quarter. The most popular iPad is the new iPad, but iPad 2 did very well. It was particularly a key in the K-12 area that Peter spoke about earlier where we sold about 1 million units for the quarter. And so, we have been very aggressive in the space, and I donât see changing that in terms of competition, weâve all seen, I think many different tablets, hundreds of them come to market over the last few year. And I have yet to see any of them really gain what I would call any level of traction at all.",1
"We have over 225,000 apps that have been optimized for iPad. There is a incredible experience on iPad, and I still think the market very much where most customers feel theyâre not really looking for tablet, theyâre just looking for an iPad. And weâre going to keep innovating in the space and keep making great products, and I think weâll keep a very strong business going forward.",1
"The 17 million iPads was up 84% year-over-year, and weâve now shipped over 84 million, this is as of the end of last quarter. iPads, which if you look at that on a trajectory rate, it took us more than twice as long to achieve that on iPod and a third longer on â we achieved it in the third less time on the iPad than iPhone, so we feel really, really good about our momentum in this space.",1
"Thanks Andy. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"Next, weâll hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.",1
"Hey, good afternoon. Tim, I know you just talked a little bit about the iPad that is there. You gave a little bit more information on the iPhone. Could you talk a little bit more about just what segments have been driving, you mentioned little bit of education, is it U.S. consumer, U.S. corporate market, is it channel sale in other markets, any more kind of feedback for us to help kind of navigate how to model this in the next few quarters?",1
"Okay. And that's helpful. And did you give maybe I missed it, but did you give an Apple TV number for the quarter and any kind of updated thoughts, and how you're thinking about that going forward?",1
"For the iPad, it was down more year-over-year than it was sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was really attributable to four things. We had a higher mix of lower priced models, we reduced the price of the iPad 2 to $399, with our expanded distribution, we had a higher mix of indirect sales this year than we did a year ago and the dollar impacted us as well.",1
"Yes, it's a good question. I didnât give it, but I can. We sold 1.3 million last quarter this was up over a 170% year-over-year, and it brings our fiscal year to 4 million units, which is pretty incredible. It's still at a level that we would call it a hobby. But we continue to pull the string to see where takes us and weâre not one to keep around projects that we don't believe in. And so, there's a lot of people here that are believers in Apple TV and we continue to invest in it and see where it will take us.",1
"So you don't do hobbies for the sake of hobbies, you do it to hope to get to be some bigger?",1
"That's right. We do it because we think we can, it will lead us somewhere. And so we'll see, I think this 4 million is not a small number, it's small relative to iPads and iPhones perhaps, but itâs not a small number and there is a lot of believers in it.",1
"From JPMorgan, we will go to Mark Moskowitz.",1
"Yes, thank you. The first question is around ASPs, the iPad and the iPhone, the blended ASPs seem to have declined a little more this quarter versus the prior quarters. Is that a function of the product portfolio or Apple just testing price elasticity as you expand into the emerging markets?",1
"Hi, itâs Peter. The iPhone ASP, we donât talk specifically about iPad and iPhone ASPs, but I would like to give you a little bit of color this quarter, because they did change some sequentially in the case of the iPad year-over-year. Beginning with the iPhone, the ASP was down due to a higher mix of lower priced models and a stronger U.S. dollar and that was the case generally on a sequential and a year-over-year. Regarding the mix, we believe that this was largely driven by all the new product rumors, economic conditions, particularly in Europe and we had a change in the ending inventory by models that also influence the ASPs.",1
"Members of the press that have additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896, and financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570, and I am at 408-974-5420. And thanks again for joining us.",1
"I donât know. You know, that question is very difficult to answer because the way that you truly find out what it is at least from my own experience and prospective is you have enough supply to serve the demand, and then you know what the demand is, and today we donât have enough from either iPhone 4 or iPad, and so I truly donât know. Obviously we have taken bets internally in terms of the capacities that we are going for and we have rolled those into the guidance that I think you can get from the guidance that I think is extremely strong, but weâre pretty confident that we have been able to pick up the supply.",1
"Operating expenses were $1.35 billion, consistent with our guidance and included $151 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $60 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 29%.",1
"Okay, Last question for me, back to you, Tim. Just trying to ballpark the size of the supply/demand gap for the iPhone and the iPad, again back of the envelope, are we talking about a couple million iPhone units short of demand and maybe half a million iPads short of demand? Is that the kind of gap we're talking about?",1
"The second reason is the overall demand was lower and we believe that this is due to the weak economy, cannibalization from iPhone, and the reduction in the market size for traditional MP3 players that as you heard Peterâs definition for this, we call traditional MP3 players the Shuffle, the Nano, and the Classic.",1
"And as a result of this, we adjusted channel inventories to correspond with this lower demand and this accounted for the balance of the over 400K unit reduction.",1
"But as a reminder, I donât want to overstate this but we began and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks and so we are staying within the rails that we have forever set as targets.",1
And weâll take our next question from Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.,1
"Thanks very much. Tim, thereâs competitors that are unveiling application stores now and media and touch features via software -- can you just talk about maybe the dimensions along which you see continuing to out-innovate competitor user experiences and maintain iPhone momentum and share leadership?",1
"Sure, Mike. You know, I donât want to talk very much about what we have planned in the future but if I just sort of summarize just whatâs happened in the last 90 days, we have just shipped the next major version of the worldâs most advanced mobile software platform with iPhone 3.0 and the App Store is now available in 77 countries, and reaches an installed base that is now more than 45 million. Thatâs the sum of iPhone plus iPod Touch.",1
"The App Store I think by any measure has been an unprecedented success with over 65,000 apps now in the store and over 1.5 billion apps downloaded. As you may remember, if you look at the App number, the over 65,000 from the store, that compares to the latest numbers we have for RIM and Nokia put them between 1,000 and 2,000 each. And the latest published number that weâve seen on Android puts it less than 5,000.",1
"And so we feel like we have a substantial lead on apps for the phone, on software for the phone, and we think we have brought a great deal of hardware innovation for the phone as well. And so we feel extremely good about our competitive position and continue to believe that we are years ahead of other people.",1
Thanks. And do you see additional distribution and pricing models important to sustain either your growth in market share gains in iPhone and do you think you can sustain growth based on the current strategy?,1
"Well, I think we just took a major change with the introduction of a $99 product and so the reason we did that was obviously because we knew that there was elasticity there. And in regard to your other question, we are working very hard to continue expanding distribution, both within countries that weâre in where it makes sense to do so and to add new countries because the world has more 80 countries in it, and so we are looking at both of those and we recognize there are some large markets left uncovered currently.",1
"Okay, thanks. And then just lastly, does the positive response to the Mac price cuts provide you some pause regarding the opportunity that you might have for similar momentum for lower priced entry level PCs? In other words, do you still feel that the lower priced PC category is perhaps not attractive versus your business model? I may not exactly be paraphrasing what you said last time but along those lines.",1
"Mike, I would say it differently, really and maybe I havenât expressed it well -- our goal is not to build the most computers; itâs to build the best. And we will -- whatever price point that we can build the best at, we will play there. At this point, we donât see a way to build a great product for this 399, 499 this kind of price point unit and we -- but you know, and as Iâve said before and I think this is playing out in several areas, I think some customers, maybe many customers buying these are -- become disappointed and disenchanted after they buy one of these, and so we are going to continue to focus on what we have always done, is making the best, the most innovative, and giving people tremendous value and I feel like the moves that weâve made across this quarter really puts an exclamation point on those.",1
"When you look at being now able to buy a Macbook Pro for $800 less than someone could have done in October of last year, itâs just jaw-dropping. And so we feel very good about our strategy and our pricing and I think frankly the results bear it out. If you look at it now, weâve now -- the Mac has outrun the market a staggering 18 of the last 19 quarters, and I think that really says that we do have the right approach.",1
"Thank you very much, Tim.",1
And weâll take our next question from Andy Hargreaves with Pacific Crest.,1
"With these events behind us, we were able to reduce channel inventory and this accounted for about half of the over 400K unit reduction.",1
"Toni, if you look at the over 400K that we reduced it by, there were two primary reasons. The first reason was that as you may remember in March, we announced and launched a new shuffle very close to the end of the quarter and also Easter, the Easter holiday was at the beginning of the June quarter, and so to support both of these, we ended March with a bit more inventory. Although still within the target range of four to six weeks.",1
"And then final question, you mentioned you lowered channel inventory on iPod about 400,000 units. Should we be thinking about the reduction in channel inventory being somewhat consistent as a percentage of what you anticipate for reduced iPhone sales in the following quarter? Or otherwise, why would you have taken it down by that amount?",1
"Toni, I donât want to give you exact mix numbers for competitive reasons but let me share with you at a macro point what we saw happening last quarter. After the transition, not our -- our non-education business, we saw a people up-selling from the 999 to the 1199 Macbook Pro. Obviously for $200, itâs a significant amount of features and so we saw that occurring last quarter.",1
Hard drives and optical drives are now recovering from some supply constraints and pricing is declining at less than historical rates as a result.,1
"In terms of the Toshiba pre-buy, we did a long-term supply agreement with Toshiba. As a part of that, as part of the terms and conditions, we paid them $500 million as a pre-pay earlier in the quarter, as Peter had said.",1
"You know, we view Flash as a very key component for us because as you know we use it in so much or so many of our products and also we are a reasonable percentage of the user of Flash on a worldwide basis.",1
"In terms of doing additional deals, we are always open to doing additional deals with the right terms and conditions and as you know, weâve done two in this fiscal year. We announced the one with LG earlier on LCDs and we may do others but thereâs not one that we are currently working on but I donât close that door because we are always looking at different things.",1
And weâll take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.,1
"Thank you. I think last quarter you had commented that the percentage of 999 Macs had increased sequentially. Can you comment on this quarter -- it sounds like there was a mix shift to the low-end because of continued economic uncertainty, yet you lowered Mac prices, which was stimulative or -- excuse me, Macbook Pro prices which was stimulative for the Pro. So give us a sense on how consumers netted out -- was your 999 offering a bigger percentage of total Mac notebooks this quarter than it was last quarter, and can you give us a little more color on the dynamic?",1
"Before the transition, we saw a mix that was larger than after it to the 999, but we did see that change at the developersâ conference.",1
"We are benefiting from a higher mix of iPhone revenues and that is beneficial to our gross margin. So as I think about this year versus last, sure, that is a factor. But as we put our guidance together for the September quarter, weâve gone through our normal process and we thought about supply, we thought about demand and it resulted in the 34% that we provided you.",1
"Education itself, when you carve education itself out, the bulk of what K-12 would buy would be the lower priced unit and we sell it for even lower prices than the consumer price, obviously.",1
"And then can you comment on the dynamics on the iPhone side -- it sounds like the lower price point, the $99 3G phone actually served perhaps more as a traffic driver for the 3GS phone than you would have anticipated. Do you think that was ultimately its role or is that product in and of itself a meaningful contributor to the iPhone story?",1
"You know, we are focused on total iPhone units and so we are very happy when the total comes out to the 5.2 number that came out and we are thrilled [at that]. I think itâs too early to tell what the ultimate mix of those products will be because as you know, the iPhone 3GS is constrained and also itâs only shipping in 18 countries of the 80-plus that we are in, and so I think it will take some amount of time. Also, thereâs a phenomenon at the beginning of purchasing where you had people upgrading and those people that upgrade are obviously more likely to select the new phone, and so itâs only been a few weeks and I wouldnât want to make any grand statements about what things will happen in the longer term.",1
"And then one for Peter -- Peter, I think your sequential gross margin guidance in terms of sequential decline is actually more benign than you have guided for in each of the last two years, which is surprising to me because the component environment I think is tougher than itsâ been in either of the last two years. Your back-to-school promotion in terms of geographic breadth are considerably broader this quarter and you have notebook price cuts, which you didnât have in either of the previous fiscal Q4s.",1
"So was it -- is the offset in terms of your guiding to a lower gross margin sequential decline, is that all iPhone related or are there other considerations relative to previous years that we ought to be thinking about?",1
"Toni, itâs always hard to talk about gross margin year over year because you are typically in different product cycles and you have different component environments and currencies can be different and mixes and a variety of things, so itâs hard.",1
"Iâm just wondering on the iPhone -- the services and apps, they are obviously growing really fast -- is that putting or is the growth there constrained do you think by the network capacity of your carrier partners?",1
"I think thatâs a better question for them but what I see without talking about specific ones, I see them making more investment in order to have faster networks and see them being very happy about driving higher ARPUs and lower churn. You know, this changes their cost of customer acquisition if they are not out churning people left and right and so I think they will continue to make investments to deliver services that people really enjoy, which is faster networks.",1
"Do you think you guys will end up making investments on the side, whether itâs a knock or a data center or something to help take some of the pressure off them or offload some of that capacity?",1
"Okay, well, let me ask a question about the App Store then -- in terms of application prices, there appears to be a race to the bottom. Iâve noticed that thereâs an increasing number of $0.99 offerings. Do you regard this as a concern and if so, are you taking any steps to enable consumers to separate quality apps from the garbage?",1
"In terms of affecting the country rollout, I believe the vast majority of the countries that we are selling the 3G in will be selling the 3GS by the end of the fiscal quarter. So it may move a date by a few weeks here or there but I think the vast majority will be shipping in by the end of the fiscal quarter.",1
"Tim, any update on the iPhone in China?",1
"Nothing to work, nothing to add today specifically, other than it continues to be a priority project and we hope to be there within a year.",1
And weâll take our next question from Charles Wolf with Needham & Company.,1
"I have a couple of questions. On sales of the iPhone, could you share with us any information you have regarding the division between new activations and upgrades?",1
"Charlie, I canât share that information. Some of that information is confidential to the carriers themselves. The customer signs up with a carrier.",1
"Charlie, we are always looking for ways to categorize apps differently and we do have some ideas in this area. As you know, today we do it by type of App and also have show popular apps and top-selling apps, et cetera.",1
"Thanks very much. Do the supply constraints on the iPhone 3GS in any way impact your rollout for the remaining countries? Or put another way, when do you expect supply demand to reach equilibrium for the iPhone?",1
We realize thereâs opportunity there for further improvement and are working on that.,1
"In terms of the price, the developer sets the price and so itâs up to the developer what to charge and I think what they are doing is they are doing what any good business person would do, is doing the elasticity analysis and deciding where to best set their price. I would think as the installed base grows more and more and more, it makes more and more sense to have a bit lower prices and -- but thatâs totally up to the developers and I am sure each of them may do that in a little different manner.",1
"Thanks, Charlie, and thanks to everyone. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on iTunes Store, as webcast on Apple.com/investor and via telephone, and the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112, or 719-457-0820. The confirmation code is 2531481. And these replays will be available beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.",1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896, and financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570 and I am at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated third quarter fiscal year 2010 earnings release conference call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, maâam.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Appleâs CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, and he will be joined by Apple COO, Tim Cook and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with analysts.",1
"Let me answer both questions -- one, I donât want to predict today when supply and demand will balance. I know that it will not balance in the short-term and I donât want to give a prediction because as you can guess, itâs very difficult to gauge the demand without having the supply there to find out what it is, and so I donât want to do that.",1
And weâll take our next question from Chris Whitemore from Deutsche Bank.,1
"We have no plan to do so. You know, when we entered this business, we looked at it and came to a conclusion that what we could do really well was deliver a world-class handset because of our hardware and software skills and that we could uniquely play in that world and deliver something that was revolutionary.",1
"Thanks. A question with regard to iPhone activations -- based on my calculations, it seems as though that the U.S. has represented about 40% or so of the total activations over the last couple of quarters. I mean, should we be entering a point here where the international side should start to pick up here and start growing materially faster? I just wonder if you could help us think about this.",1
I think there are other people that have much more skills at networks and I think we are dealing with a lot of those as partners. I think thatâs their business and they are quite good at it.,1
And weâll take our next question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Thanks. A couple of follow-ups, Tim, first on the conversation around 399, 499 netbook or whatever you want to call it -- I understand that the ability of Apple to make something that is high quality at that price point is limited but do you think there is perhaps an emerging market for a truly mobile device that would have perhaps a larger screen where you can do more with it than on the iPhone that is big enough that you may want to participate at, regardless of price?",1
"I never want to discount anything in the future and never want to specifically answer a question on new products, as you probably know, Katy. The point I am making right now is that I think most customers that are buying a portable want a full featured notebook and we delivered those and delivered some incredible values in those and we feel like, and we know from our research the customers are very happy with those. I think some of the netbooks that are being delivered or many of those are -- have very -- are very slow. They have software technology that is old. They donât have a robust computing experience. They lack horsepower. They have small displays and cramped keyboards -- you know, I could go on and on but I won't.",1
And so that kind of thing I think many people will not be happy with and we are only going to play in things where we can deliver something that is very innovative that we are very proud of.,1
And weâll take our next question from Bryan Marshall with Broadpoint Amtech.,1
We donât release the percentage of iPhone sales by geography and so I wouldnât want to get into that. We view it as competitive information.,1
"Thank you, Bryan. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"Generally speaking, you would find that smartphones in general are being sold in larger numbers and environments where post-pay is the primary payment mechanism, not that there are zero phones being sold in pre-pay; there are some but itâs much lower and so you can look at and do an analysis of where those post-pay countries are and find that thereâs a disproportionate number of phones relative to the total phone market being sold there but thatâs not unique to Apple. I think thatâs the reality of the smartphone market currently.",1
"And Tim, having said that, some of your competitors are sort of tinkering around with some of the prepaid models out there. Is that something that you might be interested in down the road?",1
"Well, weâre doing that as well and we see by prepay in markets that are predominantly prepay and I think we have more to learn in that environment. I think this is an environment where we are still a beginner in some ways and I think can make drastic improvements.",1
"I think our business model works quite well in the post-pay category but pre-pay is an opportunity for us. We are trying it in both markets where post-pay is dominant of the two and we are trying it where pre-pay is the dominant, so we have multiple things going on right now and hopefully weâll learn from that and improve as we move forward.",1
"Okay, final question -- any help you can give with regard to the percent of the iPod Touch user base, which we calculate north of 20 million at this point, that actually upgraded to the new iPhone 3.0 software?",1
I would call it a good number and I donât want to be more specific but obviously we priced that extremely aggressively and we are very much wanting to get the platform out there. Itâs great for our ecosystem and the developers will sell more apps as a part of that and so we tried very hard to get people to upgrade.,1
"In terms of going forward, the market for DRAM and the market for large sized LCDs have shifted to a constrained environment, and the pricing has moved accordingly. The NAND Flash market has now begun to stabilize and we expect it to move toward a supply demand balance.",1
"Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on the commodities -- Iâm just curious as to which ones you expect to be sort of challenging going forward and how should we think about the pre-buy with Toshiba and should we continue to expect additional pre-buys, depending on what you think in terms of inventory and demand and pricing?",1
"As we announced at WWDC, we expect -- we continue to expect to ship it later this quarter.",1
So we are seeing a mix down versus historic and we think part of that is that the commercial customer who was buying up in the line is delaying purchases in this weak economy.,1
"Sure, Bill. Relative to the market, the consumer market performed relatively better for us. The U.S. K-12 institutional business is weak, as you might expect and itâs getting hit by budget shortfalls and last quarter we saw very negligible amount, if any, of the stimulus funds flow all the way to the state and district levels to get spent, so that may or may not occur this quarter.",1
"In the pro business, the pro business has also been affected more by the economy than the consumer business is and you can see that some in our ASPs, itâs people that were buying those that were in commercial accounts and small business accounts are delaying purchases.",1
"Tim, youâve talked about higher ed growth and K-12 institutional growth before. Can you give us those numbers for this quarter?",1
"Overall, we were negative 6% in the institutional business. The K-12 business was more negative than that and the higher ed business was around the 0% level.",1
"Okay, and then one other, if I could -- in terms of preliminary view after the price changes on mix with the older Macbook, the 999, and then the newer form factor, any additional details you can give us on the first 30 days of what you saw about mix shift with the price changes?",1
"Generally, as you can see from the data sheet that youâve got, our units grew faster than our revenue in the portable area, and so ASP did fall some and one of the reasons is the price cuts that we took; another is the transitional cost of doing that. What was a major transition of replacing the whole lineup basically in a day.",1
"Of course, weâre thrilled with our overall results -- to grow 4% with IDC forecasting a negative 3 and Gardner forecasting a negative 5, that puts us 7 to 9 points ahead of the market and we are thrilled with those performance numbers.",1
And weâll take our next question from Bill Fearnley with FTN Equity Capital.,1
And weâll take our next question from David Bailey from Goldman Sachs.,1
"I know you donât break out the SKUs of the iPhone explicitly but can you give us some idea of how the $99 iPhone is doing relative to the other price points? And have you see a change in mix since the launch, either away from or toward the lower end phone?",1
"Thereâs two pieces of information I can give you, David. One is that as we made the changes, the two changes, both the launch of the 3GS and the price reduction of the 3G, we saw a significant acceleration in total unit sales. I donât want to give you the precise mix because we view that as competitive data and obviously want to hold that tight.",1
"As Peter alluded to in his opening comments, the iPhone 3GS is currently constrained in virtually every country that we are shipping in, and so the demand for it has been very robust and I think it speaks to the great product that it is and we are working very hard to fill that demand.",1
"Great, and then just a follow-up on that -- can you give us an update on the progress you have made in large enterprise accounts with the iPhone and how you look at that opportunity over the next year?",1
"Well, I think itâs a great opportunity for us and as you might guess, we are seeing growing interest with the release of the 3GS and iPhone OS 3.0, due in part to the new hardware encryption and the improved security policies.",1
"Thanks. If I could on the mix here, when you look at consumer spending and then you look at K-12 and state and local government and the pro segment in the quarter, is there any detail you can give, particularly on the education and the pro segments? And then I have a quick follow-up.",1
I think itâs an excellent relationship and we are very happy with it.,1
"Specifically, to give you some numbers, almost 20% of the Fortune 100 have purchased at least 10,000 units or more and thereâs now multiple corporations and government agencies who have purchased in excess of 25,000 each.",1
"In closing, we are thrilled to report record June quarter results and with customers reception of our new portables, iPhone OS 3.0, and the iPhone 3GS. We are very enthusiastic about the upcoming launch of Snow Leopard and the enhanced performance and user experience it will offer to our Mac customers. We remain confident in our strategy and new product pipeline and we are working hard to continue to deliver the industryâs most exciting and innovative products.",1
"Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $31.1 billion at the end of the June quarter, compared to $28.9 billion at the end of the March quarter, an increase of over $2.2 billion. Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $2.3 billion.",1
"Our investment priority for the cash continues to be preservation of capital, which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short-dated, high quality investment and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio. And while it is not reflected in our June quarter results, in the first week of a September quarter, we made a $500 million pre-payment to Toshiba for future supply of NAND Flash.",1
We will continue our practice of providing guidance based on GAAP and weâll report our September quarter non-GAAP financial measures to you in October when we release our results.,1
"Forecasting in the current macroeconomic environment remains challenging, so we will continue to provide a range of guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be between $8.7 billion and $8.9 billion. We expect gross margin to be about 34%, reflecting approximately $28 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $1.445 billion, including $150 million related to stock-based compensation.",1
"We expect OI&E to be about $30 million, reflective of a short-term interest rate environment, and we expect the tax rate to be about [30%].",1
We are targeting EPS in the range of about $1.18 to $1.23.,1
(Operator Instructions) Weâll take our first question from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.,1
"Okay, and then I guess on AT&T, any update on the status of that relationship?",1
"Good afternoon and congratulations. Two brief questions -- first on the Mac side judging by the product lead times, the demand for the new lower priced Macbook Pro caught you off guard. How do you see that demand trending through the September quarter?",1
"And second, can you just talk from a high level how you see the relationships with the wireless carriers evolving?",1
"In terms of the Macbook Pro, there are a couple of models that are somewhat constrained today but I believe we will get beyond this in the next few weeks. We donât feel that the constraint had a material effect on last quarter and we factored our view of supply into the guidance that Peter shared with you.",1
"In terms of the relationship with the wireless carriers, I think that most of the carriers that we are doing business with are thrilled over the lower churn that they experienced with iPhone and the higher ARPUs and of course, their customers are demanding the iPhone and so I feel like weâve got a very good set of relationships and we are obviously continuing to look to expand those.",1
"Okay. Maybe to ask it more specifically, do you see opportunities beyond the iPhone with the carriers, for example, AT&T with data plans and laptops, or AT&Tâs living room initiative with [inaudible]?",1
We have nothing to announce today in terms of other things with the carriers. We are very focused on working with the carriers on iPhone.,1
"The phone is particularly doing well with small business and with large organizations that allow people to purchase the phones for individual use, and this is both in corporate and government settings.",1
"We also had the iPhone approved in over 300 higher education institutions and so we feel really good about how we are doing and you may have noticed also that the most recent study by J.D. Powers has ranked the iPhone the highest in overall satisfaction with business customers, and so we think that we are just at the tip of the iceberg in terms of what the iPhone can do with the business customer.",1
We have priced it very aggressively so that all of our users can upgrade to it and we are hoping that they do that.,1
"As we expected, thereâs some number of people that are buying up because they can now get a Macbook Pro from $1199, whereas it wasnât too many months ago that to buy a Macbook Pro, it would cost $1999, and so weâve made a significant change there.",1
Of inventory?,1
"You know, consistent with what Iâve said before, you can do the math, but itâs about 1.83 million, just slightly over 1.8.",1
That includes in-transits that weâve invoiced and demos weâve counted in a conservative manner.,1
And weâll take our next question from William Shope with Credit Suisse.,1
"Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Looking at the response youâve seen on the 999 Macbook and the more recent Macbook Pro price cuts, can you comment on whether the Mac business is more or less elastic than you previously anticipated and perhaps give us an idea of how you thinking about elasticity in this business over the longer term?",1
We are obviously thrilled with the results that weâve had since we done the portable announcement. Mac sales did accelerate after the announcement [at WWDC] and shipment of the portables and we feel great about how they are selling.,1
"So we are not thinking fundamentally different about the Mac business than we were before. Our goal has been and continues to be to build the best computers in the world and when we can do that at lower prices, we do that. When we canât, we won't put the Apple brand on a product that doesnât stand for innovation and doesnât have the legendary ease of use that we are known for.",1
"Whatâs that unit number, and then Iâll cede the floor here?",1
"Okay, and then just so weâre all on the same page -- any chance you can give us some quantitative color on the gross margin EPS impact from the delayed iPhone recognition in the June quarter?",1
"I canât do anything specifically. You can make an estimate of what the revenues might have been, now that you know the June quarter sales and you can take a shot at the related gross margin.",1
"Okay, great, weâll do that. Thanks.",1
And weâll take our next question from Shannon Cross from Cross Research.,1
Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you give us an update on Snow Leopard and how we should think about the $29 price point? Iâm kind of curious as to what drove the decision to go so low and how are you thinking about potential adoption rates?,1
"Snow Leopard is an even better Leopard. It redefines about 90% of the projects which make up OS10 and it includes a lot of powerful new core technologies and builds Microsoft Exchange support right into the OS, which is something that even Windows PCs do not do.",1
The unit number?,1
"The iPhone channel inventory was flat sequentially, so it was approximately the same number from the beginning of the quarter and at the end of the quarter. And what that means obviously since we were selling a lot more units at the end, that we do not have a channel loaded with the number of units that we would like at this time and you can see that in terms of stock-outs on the 3GS.",1
And weâll take our next question from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.,1
"Thanks, Peter.",1
"Thanks. Peter, I was just wondering, regarding your revenue guidance, you are guiding up roughly 4% to 7% sequentially but youâve got a couple hundred million of iPhone deferred revenue coming off the balance sheet and obviously you are doing very well with the new products. So I was wondering why you are guiding generally in line with last yearâs increase and maybe a little bit below what we consider normal seasonality for the September quarter. Thanks.",1
"Rich, we give you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving, so no change in our thinking.",1
"Let me talk a little bit about Mac and iPod and iPhone. For Mac, while we usually see an increase in Mac units from the June to September quarters, and we expect to see one this year, we would expect the sequential increase to be less than previous years, since we refreshed every portable last quarter and the desktops in the March quarter, making the comparison sequentially tougher for us.",1
"Additionally, as Tim just commented, the U.S. institution, education institution sales remain under pressure from some budget shortfalls.",1
"As regard the iPod, similar to June we would expect the traditional MP3 players to decline year over year but iPod Touch to grow significantly.",1
"And for phone, last year we sold very few phones in the June quarter as a result of the July transition and $7 million in September, which included 2 million units [of channel fill]. This year we introduced the iPhone 3GS in June, selling 5.2 million in the quarter and in terms of assessing how we will do going from June to September, we are very optimistic about the product, itâs off to a great start but we just donât have any experience in this seasonality with distribution as wide as weâve got it, so weâll report to you in October how we did.",1
And weâll take our next question from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.,1
"Okay, thanks and with regard to the surge at the end of the quarter of iPhones, 5.2 million and youâre constrained on the 3GS, what is the inventory situation like? I mean, you were running at over a million, I believe, Tim, and how did you end the quarter on inventory? And how is the pent-up demand look though heading into the next one?",1
"Thank you very much. Peter, could you talk about gross margins? Youâve obviously the last two quarters handily exceeded any of your expectations and guiding above, at one point you said 30% for September and now weâre at 34%. And does that mean that the long-term estimate of 30% no longer holds and that we should probably model something at least higher than 30 due to maybe better execution or something in your business model thatâs changed?",1
The teams are executing phenomenally well and so thatâs something that we are very proud of and I think the results have benefited from that.,1
"You know, regarding gross margins for the September quarter, weâve had a chance to go through our complete process and Iâm guiding to 34% for the September quarter, which is down from the 36% that we just reported.",1
We expect the margins to decline sequentially as a result of a full quarter of back to school promotion and a full quarter of our new portables and also higher component costs.,1
I donât want to make comments today about future quarters but I will give you a couple of things that are on our mind.,1
"First, for many key components, costs are rising and you are seeing that in the market as well. And secondly, we will continue to focus on delivering state-of-the-art products at price points that our competitors canât match and we are going to provide customers ever-increasing value. And so as you think about quarters beyond September, I would urge you to consider those factors.",1
"Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2009 as amended, the Form 10-Q for the first two quarters of fiscal 2010 and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased to report outstanding results for the June quarter. During the quarter, we began shipping iPad to millions of delighted customers in 10 countries, weâve launched the very popular iPhone 4, we shipped iOS 4 with many great new features, and we set a new all-time record for quarterly Mac sales.",1
"We are shipping the best products in Appleâs history, and response from our customers has been terrific. And as a result, we are thrilled to announce today our highest quarterly revenue ever, surpassing the previous record set in the most recent holiday quarter. Revenue was $15.7 billion, an increase of $6 billion or 61% over the prior June quarterâs results. The tremendous revenue growth was driven primarily by the very successful launch of iPad, in addition to the strong sales of iPhone and Mac. Operating margin was $4.23 billion representing 27% of revenue. Net income was $3.25 billion up 78% over the year-ago quarter and earnings per share were $3.51.",1
"Okay, I guess the last question for me then is directed to Tim if I could. Android-based shipments are certainly increasing and gaining a lot of press. I wondered if you guys could give any color about where you might be seeing Android as competition to the iPhone family in terms of GO or customer sets or any other color there, and that's my last question. Thank you.",1
"Hi. Thank you. I had a couple as well. Peter, when the iPhone, when you were using the accrual accounting or the deferred accounting rather on the iPhone, the deferred balances indicated that margins went up over time. Would you anticipate that the iPad margins would increase as we move forward?",1
"We were purposely aggressive when we launched the iPad, because we absolutely believed we had a great product and we had a great first mover advantage. So, we were aggressive coming out of the shoots, and as both Tim and I have commented, we are selling them as quickly as we can make them. I think it was a very, very good way to launch the product for us.",1
"We are always working to become more efficient and to write down the cost curves, and I donât see that motivation being any different on the iPad than it is on our other products.",1
"Okay. A few to follow-ups, Peter, is there any comments that you could make on the impact of the bumpers? I know you said you were incurring the costs in the September quarter. Is there any way to quantify in terms of a basis points or any other metric that you can give us for the impact in the September quarter?",1
"Well, there are two impacts of this. The first is we will need to defer revenue for the iPhone 4s that we sell, where we have not delivered the bumpers, and where we have not heard from the customers wanting to place an order. And I expect the accrual that we will need to make, which is a revenue accrual with no cost to be about $175 million in the September quarter, and I would expect to have that be recorded as revenue in the December quarter.",1
"We will expense the cost of the bumpers when we ship them to customers, and our most important objective there is to take care of every customer and delight them.",1
"You know, I havenât seen the android results for June, since it is some of several companiesâ shipments. But iPhone sales were up 61% in the June quarter despite the inventory drawdown and the transition that we spoke about. And that is against the IDC estimate Smart phone market growth of 38%. And so we are growing substantially faster than the market.",1
"Toni, our iPod ASPs were down about $7 sequentially. And that really was driven by the start of the back to school promotion, which we began in the month of June and a stronger US dollar. We did mix on a year-over-year basis up into iPod Touch, and Iâm sorry, I donât have on a sequential basis the test mix in front of me.",1
"Thank you, Keith. Could we have the next question please?",1
"From RBC Capital Markets, we will hear from Michael Abramsky.",1
"Hi, thanks very much. Tim, do you think that there has been some sort of I think still some questions around sustainability of iPad demand after early adopters and international channel fill, even with new product cycles given that it is still a relatively new category, and I am wondering what your thoughts are there, and also given that there may be some competitive subsidized 3G tablets coming in the fall. How do you see that potentially impacting or not the iPod pricing strategy or demand? Thanks.",1
"Mike, the only thing I can share right now is that on iPad, we are absolutely selling every unit that we can make, and it looks good in every country that we have launched in so far, and we are excited about launching in additional countries this coming week. And anecdotally it does seem to me that it is beyond an early adopter stage, already as I indicated earlier, just based on watching the people that are using it.",1
"And so, it is the fastest that that has happened in any product I know of, or have ever been involved with. So, I think it is extremely unique and extremely special. In terms of what the competition does, I donât know what they will do and what they will try. It is no secret that everybody is trying to work on something to come out with it, but we are extremely happy with our competitive position, and the business model that we have. If you look at the US as an example, since everybody can look at that model where you have a very affordable rate structure that starts at $15 with no commitment at all. And a very aggressive price that seems to be what the end-user really desires.",1
"And so yes, somebody could come in and jack the rate plans way up, and subsidize, Iâm not so sure that people are really going to want another contract. We will see if somebody tries that and weâll both learn. Right now weâre thrilled with our position.",1
"Thanks, Toni. Can we have the next question please?",1
"And final question, you had talked a little bit about cannibalization of iPad on Macs and I know you talked about the iPod and iPod Touch on a year-over-year basis, but sequentially, your ASPs fell quite a bit on the iPod business. Do you think there may be any cannibalization of iPad on iPod Touches and specifically can you comment on whether iPod Touch was a higher percentage of units sold or actually if you sold higher percentage of units sold in Q3 versus Q2?",1
"Yes, in the past, iPhone software developers have complained not about the App Store rules, but the fact that they were arbitrary. Has Apple done anything to address this issue?",1
"I donât expect them â the ones that we benefited from to reoccur, and again I donât want to be specific but these were things that really just occurred in our supply chain and with other product costs.",1
"Thank you, Brian. Can we have the next question please?",1
"Yes, thank you. I wanted to revisit the gross margin question, please. Peter, on your guidance last quarter, you basically said about a quarter of the expected sequential decline in gross margins was expected to come from iPads, about 150 basis points. Relative to your expectation on that, what kind of impact did iPad have on gross margins versus your guidance, and why may it have been different?",1
"Toni, the factors that we cited last quarter largely on a collective basis were as we thought. And we did about 310 basis points better than we had guided too, and a little more than half of that was those five factors, not being as quiet as deep as we thought. And the biggest piece of that difference really came from selling more iPhones and selling accessories. So the other factors were generally about what we thought they would be.",1
"So if we think about it, you are expecting to be down about 570 basis points, you were down about 260 basis points, but you had mentioned you had a favorable benefit as well as some operating leverage. What was the collective impact of those two positive forces of operating leverage in favorable? So were you down? You thought you would be down 570 from those factors and you were down 400 to 450, and then you had favorable impact of 150 from the other two factors, or how do we think about that in basis points?",1
"Sure. So, we were ahead of what we thought by about 310 basis points. A little more than half of that came from the 5 factors not being quite as deep as we thought, and it was mostly selling more iPhones and more accessories that drove that. A little less than half of the 310 basis points occurred from the unanticipated favorable adjustments and the leverage on the higher revenue. And the favorable adjustments were the bigger piece of that segment growth.",1
"Okay, thank you. That's helpful. On the favorable adjustments, can you comment on whether they were one-time and whether they are discretionary, any more color you can provide on those?",1
"And on the â Tim, you had talked a little bit about channel inventory. It sounds like, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you might have 1.4 million in existing channel inventory of the older 3GS, the 16 and the 32 gig. Is that a correct, and where and how are those being sold currently?",1
You would have to look at the whole line.,1
"Toni, we had about 1.4 on June 26, which was the end of the fiscal quarter. Currently, we have materially less than that. And those are being sold at basically most, not all, but most of the â in most of the countries that we sell the 3GS.",1
And have you been able to take up that so since the end of the quarter the June 26th have you had any progress in increasing your total channel inventory or you feel like you are fighting a losing battle?,1
"I never feel like I am fighting a losing battle. But on iPhone 4, we are selling things as quickly as we make them, and so we have more work to do there.",1
"But I guess that implication would be if you have taken down inventory of the non-iPhone 4 product, and you are selling them as quickly as you can, that would actually suggest your total inventory would be even lower now than it was on June 26th?",1
"Well, keep in mind that we also sell the iPhone 3GS 8 gig, it is a new model in the line. And so the 1.4 million that I was referring to that I assumed that you were also referring to for the iPhone 3GS units that were in the previous generation.",1
Correct. Thank you.,1
That will come from Charles Wolf with Needham & Co.,1
"Charlie, I think that we are always looking to make our developers happy. We have over 225,000 Apps on the store with over 5 billion downloads. We were thrilled to have very recently crossed $1 billion in payments to our developers, and weâve just launched iAd, you know, with the primary objective of developing another revenue stream for that. So we care deeply about our developers and want to have many, many great Apps for our iOS products and the success that weâve had on the store today is unparalleled.",1
"Can you share with the schedule is with us, Peter?",1
"Thanks, Tim. Maybe I can shift gears to Peter real quickly. Peter, have you had a chance to kind of formulate what could be the scenario whereby some of the subcontractors that you work with that they do have to put through significant wage hikes over the next course of the contract, renewals over the next year, subcontract renewals over the next year or so, how would that impact Apple? You have to absorb any of those kind of pass through on the wage hikes or where those subcontractors have to absorb 100% of the wage hikes?",1
"Thanks, Katy. Could we have the next question please?",1
"From JP Morgan, we will go to Mark Moskowitz.",1
"Thank you. Two quick questions. Tim, just coming back to the iPad for a second, I know there is a lot of speculation about potential cannibalization down the road while it is still premature to speculate. I am just trying to get a sense, could there actually be a reverse effect where Apple maybe benefits from a halo effect where folks buy the iPad, and then they also decide maybe to buy some other Apple devices to keep at home when they're using the iPad on the road? In the early stages, has your data shown that where you are seeing someone buying an iPad, and then there is a subsequent purchase of a MacBook or iMac or an iPhone?",1
"We â thatâs a very good question Mark. I do agree that I think most people external to Apple focus on cannibalization has been negative, and internally we are focused on exactly the opposite the synergy between both technically and from a demand point of view. If you look at the iPod historically, all of the people here felt that the iPod created a halo for the Mac, and in fact as the iPod volumes kick off you will see a dramatic change in the Mac sales back in time that we experienced.",1
"And so could that happen on iPhone and iPad. You know, weâll see. I donât want to predict it but I do think that with our Mac share, the Mac has outgrown the market 17 straight quarters. However, the Mac share is still low and so there is still an enormous opportunity for the Mac to grow and certainly the more customers we can introduce to Apple through iPads and through iPhones and through iPods, you would think that there would might be some synergy with the Mac there, and there may be synergy between the iPad and the iPhones and so on and so forth and so thatâs the way that we look at it internally instead of the negative although I know everybody is more focused on the negative piece of it.",1
"You know, this is for itâs great to be to have a lower share because if it turns out that the iPad cannibalizes PCs that I think itâs fantastic for us because there is a lot of PCs to cannibalize. Itâs still a big market.",1
"You know, this is Tim again; we donât want to get into the terms of our commercial agreements. We hold these to be competitive advantages and do not want to release those.",1
"And so you know, there is some very, very extraordinary numbers in there. In the iPhone space, we are doing well in basically all of the key markets, and so in terms of expanding that, we â learning what we have learned with the exclusive deals and continuing to look market by market as Iâve indicated in the past, weâve elected to open Spain up, and at the end of this month, we will go from an exclusive carrier market to having three carriers, and so thatâs one example.",1
Okay. That's fine. Thank you,1
"Thanks, Mark. Could we have the next question please?",1
"Thanks very much. Tim, earlier you mentioned a lot of opportunity domestically for the iPhone. Do you need to expand your carrier relationships to tap that, or do you think there is plenty of head room with AT&T?",1
"No, I donât want to get into what we will or will not do. I would say that weâre very happy to be a partner with AT&T, and you know, they have been a first-class partner and have really pioneered the smart phone growth from a network point of view in the US, and thatâs all I have to say about that.",1
"Okay. Secondly on the gross margin guidance just back of the envelope it seems to suggest iPhone margins will be down maybe 10 or 15 points quarter-on-quarter. Is that in the right neighborhood, and if so can you provide a little more color which components are driving that? It seems to contradict third party data around the bill of material costs for that product.",1
"Sure. Chris, it is Peter. Let me begin by suggesting that you donât put a lot of credence in these third-party reports that you see. Itâs always amazing to me the cost categories and the components that never seem to make it into the reports, and as I, I think answered in Toniâs questions with the iPhone 4, we have been very aggressive here. This is the best iPhone that we have ever shipped. We are delivering great value to customers, and then has a higher cost structure than the predecessor product, and I donât want to comment on its specific gross margin.",1
"There are also more countries remaining, and frankly there is still increased distribution and increased market penetration like enterprise and consumer and a general move in the marketplace from the basic voice and text phones to the smart phone, all of which are in the iPhone favor, and so honestly I just see an enormous amount of opportunity out there and our biggest challenge is to decide which of these two deploy resources against not to have good ideas about which ones are â about making the list of ideas.",1
"Yes, I think both on the Mac and the iPhone and later the iPad as we roll it out to more places, I think there is still extraordinary opportunity left. I mean if you look at the Mac as an example, in Asia Pacific the Macs grew 73% year-over-year. This is phenomenal. You know, that we could grow by this much and in China we grew 144%. In Korea, we grew 184%. In Hong Kong, we almost doubled and even in a country like Spain where the economy has clearly been very difficult the Mac grew 59%.",1
"Charlie, I would just add that the vast majority of Apps are retrieved within seven days of their submission, and that many of the Apps that arenât approved have bugs in them, and are eventually resubmitted and approved. And we obviously I think all of us want to ensure that pornography and graphic scenes donât make their way to the platform, and so you know, I think these are things that I realize not 100% that everybody is going to agree with. I think many of us would want us those to occur.",1
"Shaw, itâs Tim. You have a little bit of ying and yang when we announce new portables. You will see a substantially move to portables and when there is not a new desktop announced at the same time, so I think thatâs more of what we saw than anything else, but yes there is clearly a move to mobility and in the long, long, long run, I think youâll see portables grow as a percentage of mix continually.",1
"Well, just asking the question slightly differently, do you think the concern of developers is really misplaced?",1
"We value the input of every developer and very much listen to them and modify the programs accordingly, when itâs appropriate to do that and so Iâm not going to say every concern out there is misplaced. Weâre very open to any kind of feedbacks.",1
"Okay, thanks, Tim.",1
"Thank you, Charlie. Can we have the next question please?",1
Next question will come from Shaw Wu with Kaufman Brothers.,1
"Thanks. I have two questions. First, just on your desktop Mac business, normally it is up sequentially from March to June and I understand there is a secular trend towards portables. Is there anything else, any color you can share there that's occurring?",1
"Okay. Thanks for the color. And then just second question is just on FaceTime, you talked about how you wanted to turn that into an industry standard. Just wondering how you plan to roll that out? I mean, will it be available on Windows? Will it be available â I imagine today it is on the iPhone. What about on the Mac? Any color you can share there? Thanks.",1
"And just on a more global basis, a lot of the iPhone growth has come from broadening distribution among carriers and in new countries, can you just cover the opportunity that you see or don't see to broaden within countries you are already in to go after emerging markets like China and India and then just quickly thoughts on prepaid markets and whether that is an opportunity for you?",1
"Shaw, I want to make sure that we get to all of the financial related questions today. So Iâm going to hold that one for another day.",1
Okay. Thanks.,1
"Thank you, Shaw. Could we have the next question please?",1
"Yes, Thanks. Good afternoon. Tim, when Peter was walking through the iPhone business, he said the iPhone revenues and units were particularly strong in Asia, Europe and Japan. Would love your sense as to why North America isn't on that list. Are we hitting lot of large numbers, or is there anything you can do to really reaccelerate the growth in the domestic market?",1
"I donât think we are hitting lot of large numbers. I think that the market over time will increasingly â the phone market will increasingly become a smart phone market, and you know, Steve said that long ago, and weâve seen that forecast has come true as the smart phone market continues to grow at multiples of the basic handset market that is shrinking.",1
"I think we have a lot of opportunity domestically and in the other parts of the America for that. I think Peterâs comment was more that our growth as a company whether you look at Mac, iPhone or iPod is weâre growing faster internationally than we are domestically and you can see that in the revenues as well; however, I think you have to put that in perspective because the companyâs revenues in Americas are growing over 40%, and so this is a huge number. Weâre not talking about a low number. Itâs just that the international numbers are absolutely killer.",1
We expect to complete it by the end of the calendar year and begin to use it.,1
North Carolina is on schedule. Everything is going fine.,1
"Turning to the details of our results, I would like to begin with our Mac products and services. We generated record quarterly sales of 3.47 million Macs, exceeding the previous record established in the most recent December quarter by over 100,000. This represents 33% year-over-year growth compared to IDCs latest published estimate of 22% growth for the market overall in the June quarter. We are pleased to have outgrown the global market in both the desktop and portable categories. We experienced strong double-digit Mac growth in each of our geographies, led by both the continued momentum of iMac, and the very popular MacBook Pro family, which was updated in April with faster processors, more powerful graphics and even longer battery life.",1
"The iPad, very surprisingly in the first quarter, during the first 90 days we already have 50% of the Fortune 500 that are deploying or testing the iPad. This is incredible. That is the Fortune 100, excuse me.",1
"In closing, we are thrilled with our record June quarter revenue and strong financial performance. We are very pleased with sales of iPad and iPhone 4. We are working hard on catching up with customer demand for these great products, and we look forward to rolling them out to even more customers in more countries this quarter. We are very pleased with the market share gains for our iPhones, Macs and iPods, and remain very confident in our new product pipeline.",1
(Operator instructions) Your first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"Hi, thank you very much and good afternoon. Could you talk a bit about what you are hearing from corporations on their thought on the iPhone, the iPad and Macs, just what you are seeing in terms of corporate adoption.",1
"Hi, Shannon, it is Tim. If you look at the iPhone, weâre now up to more than 80% of the Fortune 100 that are deploying or piloting the iPhone, and we also see very good momentum in the Fortune 500. In fact, over 60% of the Fortune 500 are deploying or piloting iPhone. This is also transcending into education institution, and we see around 400 higher education institutions, which have included the iPhone for faculty, staff and students.",1
"And so, iPhone is really taking off and iOS 4 was another help in doing that. In terms of the Macintosh, you can see the Mac had an incredible quarter. We are still selling principally to consumer and education, but we are seeing businesses with increasing interest in the Mac. It is more difficult to measure, because many of those sales are built into the channel. Weâre obviously thrilled with growing 33% year-on-year.",1
And then the iPad?,1
"Okay, and then â it is great. And then I had a follow up for Peter, when you talked about the growth margin upside this quarter, you mentioned that half of that came from you know those 5 areas performing better than you had expected. Can you give us any more specifics on why exactly those areas, you know, were better than you had anticipated?",1
"We expect revenue to be about $18 billion compared to $12.2 billion in the September quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 35%, reflecting approximately $40 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect most of the sequential decline to be due to a higher mix of iPhone 4 and iPad sales, which have higher cost structures and provide great value to customers, as well as the revenue deferral impact of the iPhone 4 case offer. To a lesser extent we expect the sequential decline to be driven by back-to-school promotion, and the absence of the favorable adjustments that benefited the gross margin in the June quarter.",1
"Sure, Shannon, the largest contributors were higher iPhone sales than we had included in our guidance and also higher accessory sales as well.",1
And that will come from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.,1
"Okay, great. Thanks. Tim, I wanted to start just by asking to you give us a supply/demand breakdown for each of the product categories if you would, and talk about any notable supply constraints within each product line, and how severe they are and when you expect them to be alleviated?",1
"Okay. Rich, starting with the Mac there were no significant supply demand issues during the quarter, and they are none currently. On the iPod it is the same, none of significance last quarter and none currently. The iPad and the iPhone are significantly different. Both of these products, the iPad and specifically the iPhone 4 we had backlog at the end of last quarter that we were not able to fill and currently we are still selling both of those products as best as we can make them. So, we still are quoting longer lead times than we like, and we are working around the clock to try to get supply and demand in balance. In the scheme of things, it is a good problem to have.",1
"And Tim, are you willing to provide, I guess any additional color on what the sources of constraint are and when you expect those to be alleviated or is it just simply a demand problem and not so much a supply problem?",1
"Well, I donât think â high demand is never a problem. On the iPad, as I have mentioned last quarter, we went into the iPad thinking that planning of 1 million from our capacity was a very bold move. And in fact if you look at the â a lot of the industry analysts were predicting that we would only sell somewhere around that number for the whole calendar year.",1
"We expect OpEx to be about $2 billion, including about $195 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be about $50 million reflective of the short-term interest rate environment, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.5%. We are targeting EPS of about $3.44.",1
"Looking ahead to the September quarter, I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. As we announced on Friday, we will be offering free cases to all customers who have purchased an iPhone 4 through September 30. As a result, we will be deferring revenue corresponding to the value of the cases that are yet to be ordered by or delivered to eligible customers under this offer as of the end of the September quarter. We estimate this deferral to be about $175 million, and we expect the September quarter deferral to be recognized as revenue in the December quarter. We will recognize the cost of the cases upon delivery to our customers.",1
"The iPhone, we just started ramping it in June. We had very limited days last quarter. As you know, we launched on the 24, and the quarter ended on 26. And we were still ramping and increasing volume, but again there is not a specific thing that is overwhelming. It is just a matter of getting up the ramp.",1
"At the end of the June quarter, we had iPhone distribution with 154 carriers in 88 countries. We continued to experience very strong year-over-year growth, particularly in Asia, Europe and Japan. Additionally, we continued to be very pleased with strong sales growth from both long-standing and new carrier partners.",1
We are also pleased to report record Mac sales in our US education institution business despite state budget constraints. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory.,1
"Moving onto our music products, we sold 9.4 million iPods, compared to 10.2 million in the year ago quarter. Sales of iPod Touch continued to be very strong with sales growing 48% year-over-year. The continued mix shift towards iPod Touch resulted in an overall iPod ASP increase of 12%, generating total iPod revenue growth of 4%. iPodâs share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD. iPod also continued to be the top selling MP3 player and to gain share internationally year-over-year in nearly every country we track based on the latest data published by GFK.",1
"The iTunes store had another great quarter with revenue exceeding $1 billion and growing 25% year-over-year. The App Store continues to be an unparalleled success with more than 225,000 apps available including more than 11,000 apps specifically for iPad.",1
"iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad users have downloaded over 5 billion apps from the App Store. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory.",1
"I would now like to turn to iPhone. We were very pleased with iPhone sales of 8.4 million, including over 1.7 million iPhoneâs 4s in the initial five countries where it was launched. This represents 61% year-over-year growth and is considerably higher than IDCs latest published estimate of 38% growth for the global Smart Phone market overall in the June quarter. Customers are loving the great new features of iPhone 4, including FaceTime for video calling, the high resolution Retina display, HD video recording, and the beautiful new glass and stainless steel design.",1
"Recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales and carrier payments was $5.33 billion during the quarter compared to $3.06 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 74%. The sales value of iPhones alone was about $5 billion, which yields an ASP of about $595.",1
"During the quarter, we surpassed cumulative sales of 100 million iOS devices. Response to the iOS 4, since its June 21 launch, has been very favorable with customers and reviewers praising its many new features including multitasking, folders, enhanced mail and deeper enterprise support.",1
"Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $45.8 billion at the end of the June quarter compared to $41.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, an increase of $4.1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $4.8 billion. Our investment priorities for cash continues to be preservation of capital, and We are continuing to focus on relatively short dated high quality investments, and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio.",1
"Turning to iPad, we are off to an amazing start, and we are extremely pleased with customer response of sales to date. Through the end of the June quarter, we shipped 3.27 million iPads to customers in 10 countries. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was 2.17 billion. The sales value of iPads alone was almost $2.1 billion, which yields an ASP of about $640. Feedback from customers continues to be outstanding as more and more of them experience iPad and take advantage of its multi-touch user interface, large screen and high-quality graphics to browse the web, read and send e-mail, read e-Books and much more. We look forward to bringing iPad to customers in nine additional countries on July 23.",1
"I would now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which had an outstanding quarter generating record revenue and customer traffic. The retail revenue was $2.58 million compared to $1.49 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 73%. Our stores sold 677,000 Macs compared to 492,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 38%. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the June quarter were to customers who have never owned a Mac before. We opened seven new stores during the quarter, including four in the US, two in Australia and one in Canada, ending with 293 stores. With an average of 287 stores open during the June quarter, average revenue per store was $9 million compared to $5.9 million in the year-ago quarter.",1
"Retail segment margin was $593 million compared to $387 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted a record 60.5 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 38.6 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 57%. We expect to open 24 stores this quarter, including our fabulous new stores in Paris and Shanghai, which opened earlier this month, our seventh bargain [ph] store in London, and our first two stores in Spain to be open in Barcelona and Madrid.",1
"Total company gross margin was 39.1%, which was 310 basis points above our guidance. This difference was driven by two categories of factors. The first category accounted for a little over half of the difference. When we provided our guidance for the June quarter, we identified five things that we expected to drive a sequential decline in gross margin from the March to June quarters. These were the first quarter of iPad sales, a stronger US dollar, our portable Mac transition, the beginning of the education buying season, and the iPhone 4 transition. Collectively, these things did have an impact sequentially, but to a lesser extent than we had anticipated in our guidance.",1
"The second category of factors, which accounted for the reminder of the difference consisted of unanticipated favorable adjustments, as well as leverage on the higher than expected revenue.",1
"Operating expenses were $1.9 billion and included $181 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&E for a quarter was $58 million. Our tax rate for the quarter was 24.2%, about three points below our guidance as a result of two factors. First, we had a better mix of foreign earnings, and this accounted for about two thirds of the difference. Second, we finalized favorably some prior year US tax audits, accounting for the remainder of the difference. As a result of the better mix of foreign earnings, we have lowered our expected fourth-quarter tax rate from 27% to 26.5%.",1
"And as you know, we did 1 million in the first month, and then the second million in the second month, and the third million in the third month. So, basically what we are doing is weâre increasing capacity as quickly as we can, and you know there are a number of things that we have to increase in order to do that. But I am fairly confident that we will be able to increase the capacity. It is not a situation where there is something profound that we canât eventually increase.",1
"Okay, and then if I could, Peter, you mentioned actually the mix of iPhone 4 and iPad sales as a negative for gross margin this coming quarter, and iPhone 4, well, iPhone in general I guess has typically had margins that are well above the corporate average. Just wondering why you would put that on the negative side of the ledger for gross margins for September, and was hoping you could tell us â give us a little more detail on the adjustments that possibly affected the gross margin in June.",1
Okay. And final question is I was wondering if you can you give us just an update on how the data center build in coming along in North Carolina and that's it. Thank you,1
"Ben, we donât â weâre not going to disclose the split between that, but all of the models have been very popular as I commented in my prepared remarks, and Tim just did. The demand has just been amazing and this is off to an incredible start, and overall ASP in the June quarter for iPad was about $640.",1
"My phone is ringing off the hook for people that want more supply. So, right now it is hard to address the real question that you are asking about is there an effect or not because weâre selling everyone that we can make, and so you canât run the experiment that way.",1
"And on the return issue, is there anything noticeable, maybe I will tease the answer because we're not seeing a huge blip up but are you?",1
"The returns that we have seen on the iPhone 4 are less than the iPhone 3GS that Pete shared in the presentation of products, and the ones for this specific issue are extremely small.",1
"Okay. Moving on with regard to the iPad, when do you think supply and demand will be in balance? And maybe if you can refer back to your experience with other products that have soaring demand and when you got the equilibrium or is there any other experience that's comparable that you can give us any indication of when you feel you could be in equilibrium for such a hot product?",1
"We honestly donât know the answer. We have been pleasantly surprised at how fast this product has gotten out of the shoot. If you look at how long it took us to sell the first million iPods, the 20 plus months versus the one month of iPad, it is just a phenomenal difference. It is not following a typical early adoptive curve, and then, you know, taking a long time to cross into the mainstream. And so I donât know how high it is. Our guts tell us that this market is very big, and we believe that iPad is really defining the market. And we want to take full advantage of it and so weâre investing enormous time and resource in increasing our capability and getting iPad out to as many people as we can.",1
"Okay. And then just finally maybe, Peter, for you are you surprised on how many people want the 3G product for the iPad, and since you launched that product what is the split between 3G and Wi-Fi?",1
"Just would seem like that's the base ASP because now have you a better mix of 3Gs, so that might be the low point. But okay, I will cede the floor. Thank you so much.",1
That will come from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.,1
"Thank you, Ben. Can we have the next question please?",1
We will move on to Brian Marshall with Gleacher & Company.,1
"Thanks. Nice quarter. A question with regards to the upside that you saw in the Mac as well as the iPhone units, I mean that's pretty impressive considering iPad came in very strongly this quarter as well, so do you have any updated thoughts kind of longer term philosophical perspective about how the iPad will potentially cannibalize or take away some dollars from some of your other product lines going forward?",1
"It is a very good question, and it is one that we do talk about internally. And we have only been selling for three months, and so I think the real answer is that it is too early to tell. If you do want to take the quarter that we just finished, weâre thrilled that we reported our best Mac quarter ever in the same quarter that iPad sold almost 3.3 million units, and so for us it is a jaw dropper.",1
"Okay, and was wondering if you can give us any updates on how the iAd business is coming to fruition here?",1
"Yes. We have just launched the iAd in the early part of July. We are going to learn a lot this calendar year and build a foundation for the future. And beyond that, I donât have any further specifics to share with you today.",1
"Yes, good afternoon. Thanks. I guess I just want to elaborate on that last question a little more, Tim. So you haven't seen any slowdown in order rates online or your lead times remain the same, and is that what you mean you haven't seen any slowdown in order rates or any increase in returns that are noticeable in the marketplace?",1
"Thank you, Gene. Can we have the next question please?",1
"Sure. Let me start with your second question, I donât want to go into a lot of specificity there, but we did have some adjustments that occurred in our supply chain and some other product cost that benefited us in June, they were the larger contributor or the second set of factors that I outlined for you. As regards to our gross margin for the September quarter, we have just introduced the iPad and the iPhone 4. We are delivering great value to customers, and these products have higher cost structures, and in the case of the iPhone 4 it has a higher cost structure than the predecessor product that we were shipping.",1
"Okay. So last quarter, I think your comment was you had about 2.7 million units in the channel. Is that correct?",1
"So, while the margin there is attractive, on a sequential basis we have been pretty aggressive here with pricing, and it is going to play through a bit on the margin line.",1
"Thank you, Rich.",1
"Hi, good afternoon and congratulations. The iPhone number was strong despite a lot of moving parts in the channel in terms of inventory this quarter versus a year ago when you launched the 3GS. Can you talk a little bit about what those dynamics were and how they impacted the 8.4 million unit number you printed?",1
"Yes, Gene, it is Tim. We greatly reduced shipments of the previous generation iPhone beginning around June 7, which was our Worldwide Developers Conference, and coincided with the announcement of the iPhone 4. But as you probably know, we did not launch the iPhone 4 and the new figure by 3GS until June 24, which was only three days before the end of the quarter.",1
"The result of that was we had significantly lower sales after June 7 for that period of time, as we waited on the official launch. In fact, if you looked at our year-over-year growth rate prior to June 7, it was around 90%. And as you know we exited the quarter, you can see that from the data sheets, we exited the quarter with total iPhone sales up 61%. And so basically we did a channel adjustment. We pulled the previous generation of iPhones down significantly in channel inventory. We increased from zero the iPhone 4 inventory and the inventory of the 8 GB 3GS, and the net reduction in the channel was about a quarter of a million units from the beginning of the quarter.",1
"And I would remind you that as you probably guessed, the run rate associated with the sales of the new product are larger than the run rate associated with sales of the old product, and so in terms of any kinds of weeks of inventory it would be much less than where we were running before.",1
"Yes, that is right, and so ended with about 2.45, and if you look at the ins and outs in that just to give you the numbers, the previous generation drawdown by the end of the quarter was slightly less than 1.3 million, and the combination of iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS was up about a million. And the vast majority of the million was in transit at the end of the quarter lot available for sale.",1
"We are, Gene, let me be very clear on this. We are selling every unit we can make currently.",1
"Okay. So, is it safe to say that you would have printed around 8.7 million iPhones if assuming more of a normalized inventory levels throughout the quarter?",1
"Well, if we would have held inventory flat from the beginning of the quarter, we would have done a little over 250,000 more units. However, what we really wanted to do is the â if we had the opportunity quite frankly is to take inventory up quarter-over-quarter, beginning of the quarter, the end of the quarter because the sales run rate was larger at the end of the quarter with the new product.",1
"Okay, and just quickly, I have a philosophical question that I can understand why you guys run out of products and the iPad comes out and it is the first time are you doing it, but these shortages that we have right out of the gate, can you just give us any insight? There is obviously a lot of talk that you guys purposely do this just to create buzz. I suspect that that's not the case, but can you give us any insight into a company that understands how to build products as well as you do that we still have these problems going into those product launches?",1
"Well, on the â let me answer that in two different ways. If you look at the previous generation product, we call the number of units that we are going to sell many weeks beforehand, and when we run out, we run out and quite frankly we tend to manage that aggressively on purpose because we were ready to market and moved very quickly to the new product.",1
"And that is what happened here, and frankly speaking Iâm glad that it happened, and it is exactly the way that we want to manage it. In terms of the new product, we do not purposely create a shortage for buzz. Iâm not sure where that comes from, but that is certainly not our objective. We would like to fill every customers order as quickly as we can. The demand for iPhone 4 is absolutely stunning. And weâre working very hard to catch up with demand and I canât predict when that will occur that I can tell you that everyone is working very hard to do it.",1
And just last question and I will turn it over. Since the issues with the antenna have you seen any changes in demand or what changes have you seen in demand for iPhone 4?,1
"Overall, we believe our year-over-year revenue growth will accelerate during the September quarter compared to the June quarter despite approximately 600 basis points of negative year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. On the product side, we expect supply constraints to be lower than what we experienced during the June quarter. Specifically related to Services, we expect revenue to grow but decelerate from the June quarter due to macroeconomic factors and foreign exchange.",1
Your next question comes from Kathy Huberty - Morgan Stanley.,1
"Thank you, Luca. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, may we have the first question, please?",1
"The App Store is growing. Chinese developers have now created a 150,000 apps -- of the apps on the App Store and so I see lots of very, very positive factors there and I couldnât be more excited.",1
"So that's how I look at that. In terms of your first comment, you didn't asked me to comment on that, but just to be clear, our forecasting doesn't work like you articulated it. I recognize that people can have their own models and so forth, but just to make it clear that I'm not agreeing with your point.",1
"Okay. And then just on the follow-up, the reported gains from currency hedging in fiscal year 2015 were significant, several billion dollar contribution to the company. And again, this is not an Apple's specific issue, Luca as you pointed out several times, but how do we think about this notion of currency hedges effectively rolling off and being replaced with hedges that are likely have less of an impact. How do we think about that impact the P&L on a go forward basis, perhaps starting with Q1, but then qualitatively or directionally over the course of the year? And what is some of kinds of things that you've undertaken or planning to undertake that could mitigate some of those concerns?",1
"Yes. I think, Toni, itâs a very good point, I mean, what's going to happen in practice is that we got this portfolio of hedge comp such that over time provides protection to our margins and to our results, but that protection diminishes as we go through the year and so we should expect that in over time during the course of fiscal 2016 that protection will come off assuming that the dollar stays at current levels. Keep in mind, there are some currencies around the world that where we cannot economically hedge and so those currencies are bit excluded from what we're talking about right now.",1
"I think my conclusion is that the guidance that we're providing for the first quarter that 39% to 40% it actually an incredible level of guidance given the foreign exchange headwinds that we're dealing with. How do we deal with that? We continue to hedge, so our program continues on an ongoing basis and we will continue to provide some level of protection to foreign exchange movement. In some cases we have realign prices particularly when we launch new products. We tend to do that in a number of countries where the foreign exchange moves have been particularly extreme, and so we tend to recover that through pricing.",1
"And then finally, of course we are putting in place a number of cost initiatives that would allow us to deal with the foreign exchange situation. So, overall we feel very strong guidance for the first quarter. And beyond the first quarter as you know we're not guiding and so we'll see over the course of the year.",1
"Thank you very much. Tim, I wanted to go back to your commentary on the enterprise business, $25 billion I think you said, it was up 40% year-over-year. I know you have a relatively small sales force internally and obviously you utilizing the joint ventures, but as you noted you see that's an important driver of growth. So, how do you attack that market going forward? Will there be changes? Is there something that you need to shift or focus product in a little bit of different directions to make sure you can adequately attack it. Just in general how you're thinking about it?",1
"From a product point of view, we'd actually been continuing to change and improve IOS for some time. With every release they are more enterprise features and so, I would describe it as sort of continuation of that cadence perhaps with little more intensity. From a go to market point of view, we will be working with or are working with IBM. With Cisco. We're already working with 75 mobility partners that are principally in the U.S. but that's expanding quickly to international as well.",1
"And so, many of these companies have -- in some cases very large sales forces, in many cases the reasonable seize sales force. And in addition to a direct sales force there is a huge worldwide indirect channel that many customers buy from and count on buying some services from. And so I do not envision Apple's having a large enterprise sales force will certainly make â we continue adding some people more on the engineering side, but I don't envision having a large direct sales force.",1
"Okay, great. Thank you. And can you give us some more color on China, 120% year-over-year growth in iPhones, but can you talk in general about what you're seeing in the marketplace and perhaps where you think you in terms of penetration from a smartphone standpoint especially with a China Mobile which has a substantial opportunity to grow given the LTE penetration?",1
"Yes. If you look at China, we grew from an iPhone point of view, Greater China, we grew 87% the market grew for. If you take iPhone out of the market number, the certain market x iPhone actually contracted slightly. And so, we've been able to grow without the market growing. iPhone 6 was the number one selling smartphone in Mainland, China last quarter and iPhone 6 Plus was number three. And so, we did fairly well. The sort of the economic question which I know there's a bit lot of attention on, frankly, if I were to shut off my web and shut off the TV and just look how many customers are coming in our stores regardless to whether they're buying, how many people are coming online, and in addition looking at our sales trend,",1
"I wouldn't know if there was any economic issue at all in China. And so I don't know how unusual we are with that. I think that there's a misunderstanding probably particularly in the Western world about China's economy, which contributes to the confusion. That said, I don't think itâs growing as fast as it was, but I also don't think that Apple's results are largely dependent on minor changes than growth. I think itâs much more of contributing â I think other things contribute to that much more. That does say, you'll never had problem there, because the economy, I'm not saying, I'm dumb enough to think that. But I just think that the area that it's currently operating within, it's hard to tell the difference of the consumer level for us. I mean, you really can't tell the difference, if you look at sort of our daily and weekly numbers.",1
"So, we're very bullish on it, and I would point out that we're investing in China not for next or the quarter after, or the quarter after, we're investing for the decades ahead and as we look at it our own views is that China will be Apple's top market in the world. And that's not just for sales, that's also developer community is growing faster than any other country in the world. And so, the ecosystem there is very, very strong. I was very impressed with the number the developers I met last week and of course, the customers in stores are enthusiastically contagious.",1
"Thank you, Shannon. Can we have next question, please?",1
We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS,1
"Thank you. Tim, I wanted to talk about the two sources of your iPhone demand selling to current customers and selling to new customers. In terms of selling to current customers you indicated about a third of the base is moved to the sixth line. As much as people talk about that been a huge upgrade cycle and what is the six has have incrementally, 33% not that a bigger number, I would have thought it would be bigger than that.",1
"We don't guide beyond December, as you know Toni. I do think that the sort of the macro things that I spoke about earlier, the upgrade programs, the Android Switcher rate, the iPhone momentum in the emerging markets and the LTE penetration in these markets these trends are not one quarter things. These are longer term things. The same â my same response applies and I think we'll do quite good in iPhone. I do believe we'll grow this quarter as we put in our guidance that when you start with a number in the low 30s in terms of the percentage of the installed base thatâs upgraded that had a phone pre the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, that number still likely to leave a lot of headroom beyond December.",1
"And so I guess the investor concern is December is a structurally advantaged quarter in the sense of benefiting from both of those tailwinds on a year-over-year basis. But if we look out beyond December, wouldn't that point to notably lower seasonal growth than the March quarter. And how do we think about the factors affecting unit growth beyond the December quarter? And then I have a follow-up, please.",1
"Yes. Thank you. Tim, I appreciated the color that you provided on the drivers of iPhone growth in Q1. I think the investor concern is that Q1 will benefit at least on a year over year basis from three extra weeks of availability in China. And it will also benefit from more of those initial launch days that only two of them were in the September quarter and the remainder will be in the December quarter.",1
"Thank you, Katy. May we have the next question, please?",1
"Also, if I zoom out and look at China, as I have said before and just to make the point once again is we see an enormous change in China over the next several years. The latest study I have seen from Mackenzie indicates if you look back five years Chinaâs middle class had about 50 million people in it. If you look ahead five years, it will have ten times that number in it. And so -- and I feel like we are reasonably well positioned in China, Iâm sure we can do better, but I think we are doing fairly well there.",1
"Itâs not the only market that we are working on obviously. I was really impressed last quarter with our progress in Vietnam and Indonesia and India among others. Also, from the currency point of view and the weak global economies, we donât overly focus on this. Itâs - my view is that itâs sort of a transitional kind of thing and we invest for the long term, so we are continuing to invest for Appleâs future.",1
"In addition to those Apple TV is off to a great start. Apple Watch is just getting going. The app store hit a new record again last quarter and the growth seems to be really great there. Iâm really happy with the early days of Apple Music and the people moving from the free trial to the music business. And finally, the enterprise business is not to be underestimated, I doubt very many people knew that we had $25 billion enterprise business that we quietly built in not too many years, but our penetration is low, but we have significant actions going on to really deepen that. So sort of everywhere I look I see significant opportunity. Long answer but I thought you might be interested.",1
"No. I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up on growth, if you look at large services companies, Facebook, Amazon, Google, they're all growing over 20% and it's largely driven by activity of Apple users on iOS devices. Do you feel like there is more that Apple can do to participate in that services growth or you relegated to fundamentals that are tied to device upgrade cycles?",1
"Well, the App Store is growing over 20%, it grew 25% last quarter, and so we feel very good about that. That's become a sizeable business. I would also point out that some of these upgrade programs that are in the market, they sort of began to look more like a subscription business in terms of the way they operate. And so we think that in the aggregate that they may reduce upgrade cycles and also the iPhone that has been sold to someone else hits the price point that we're not hitting today largely which could help further fuel the services revenue which we did quite well on last quarter.",1
Yep.,1
"Good afternoon and congratulations. Tim, you just briefly touched on as reducing the time between upgrades, but how do you think about the iPhone upgrade cycle compressing over the next few years, obviously the impact from carrierâs changes in the iPhone upgrade program. Can you talk a little bit about when that's going to be rolled out internationally? And then lastly, Luca you mentioned some of the accounting changes related to the iPhone upgrade program. Any sense in terms of what percentage of the Plus â the s upgrades were associated with the upgrade program? Thanks.",1
"Moving on, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.",1
"Gene, in terms of the upgrade program it's early, but here's what we believe our current view is that we do think that the broader upgrade program, so I'm not just talking about our program that in retail, I mean, that is relatively small compared to our total iPhone sales of the company, but the broader thing obviously is that many of the carriers are offering these plans. And that, if you look at them in the aggregate, we think that it would have a positive impact in replacement cycles. We do like the fact that it creates a market for an iPhone at a different price point as well that is a better product than that customer maybe currently buying which would further help from an ecosystem point of view and that's not to be underestimated.",1
"It also seems like that from a rollout point of view there's a -- you will see these plans offered in a significant way in the United States already, but in fact these plans are being offered in some derivation in over dozen countries in the world. They're not as pervasive as they are in the U.S. but it seems like weâre on the front end of fairly major trends in the industry.",1
"From a financial perspective, Gene, the transaction on our iPhone upgrade program is a purchase, itâs not a lease and so we recognize our revenue upfront, of course we deduct also upfront the cost associated with the program essentially to provide interest free financing and we need to estimate deferred value of the upgrade option for the customer, but as Tim said, itâs a popular program in our U.S store, in the scheme of things, itâs a small percentage of our worldwide iPhone sales and so we'll have really a negligible impact for example, on ASPs for the phone.",1
"And Tim, if we put it all together is it something that has more measurable impact on the business two, three quarters down the road, is that the right way to generally think about it?",1
"Yes, we think about it as being â there were some clearly that were offered in the market prior to this cycle. But they became much more pervasive and much communicated, I think much wider with the September announcements. And so, I would sort of expect to begin seeing this somewhere around a year from now.",1
"Thank you, Gene. May we have the next question, please?",1
"Does this suggest that there is maybe more of a consistency to upgrading than the street perceives. And then on the other side in terms of new customers, just wanted clarity on the switcher number, are you saying that 30% of iPhone shipments in the quarter went to android switchers to IOS. And do you believe that you could actually have more new customers to Apple in fiscal 2016 than you had fiscal 2015.",1
"There's a lot there. Let me start with the Android Switcher. What this means is that for customers to purchase an iPhone last quarter and replace the smartphone that 30% of those switched from an android device. And so there would have been some switchers on top of that from other operating systems, but obviously android is the largest one by far. And so that's what that means, and that number is the largest that we've ever recorded since we began measuring it three or so years ago.",1
"And so, itâs a huge number, we're very, very proud of that number. In terms of 2016 versus 2015 new customers, it's hard to predict. I'm very happy with how we're doing. We're doing better than we've ever been doing. People -- I know there's a fixation on the upgrade rate. When I look at the upgrade rate, Steve, what I see is I feel good that itâs a low number because that's low number means that there is 69% of the people that are out there prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 plus that haven't bother to upgrade this year. That's a large number.",1
"And to some degree you can already do that with buying online. But there are many different plans and search what the people buy, that they have to come in for several times we would love to have that automated and working with our partners, with service providers.",1
"Is it revenue? I was making a revenue statement but units are also, yes we expect units to be up as well.",1
"Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question please?",1
"Yes thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask Tim maybe if you could comment on the mix between iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. And whether the mix of demand is any different than what you say for instance that the iPhone 5, 5s point whether there is more say iPhone 6, I know you highlighted that the iPhone 6 is a number one phone in China for example and then I have a follow up?",1
"The statement I made in China was about Q4 and the 6s was only available in China for two days last quarter. The iPhone 6s is the most popular iPhone that we currently sell. In terms of has there been a change. If you look at iPhone 6 today, and add iPhone 6 Plus and compare that to last yearâs 5s we are doing better, at that price point than we were previously.",1
"Okay, thank you. And then thereâs follow up for what you were doing on the upgrade program. I am wondering if can you envision a time ever made in the U.S. or elsewhere where you would not have to come into an Apple store to activate it or to take advantage of the upgrade you might be able to do that somewhere else, do you start now what yourâ¦.",1
Thatâs a really good question. We actually solved that problem back in 2007. But then quickly had to change it in order to scale in a major way. And so that is something that we would always -- sort of always in our mind that one day from a customer experience point of view we would like to make things as easy as possible for the customer.,1
A - Nancy Paxton,1
I donât know that we will exit. We make that call late in the quarter as we see what the demand is because we are actually trying to position the inventory for the following quarter instead of the current quarter. And itâs very difficult to predict. What was your other question?,1
"Thank you, Rod. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and please enter confirmation code 795707. And these replays will be available by approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.",1
Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414 and,1
financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570 and at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.,1
"Good day everyone and welcome to this Apple, Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. And after that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2015, the forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"I was just curious to your statement on iPhone growth in fiscal Q1, is that a reflection ofâ¦.",1
"Got it. And then Tim when you talk about seeing iPhone growth in fiscal Q1, Iâm curious is that statement more reflective of iPhone units or iPhone revenues so that the ASPs could hardly get growth even if units are not there. And then would you expect to exit within the 5 to 7 week optimal inventory range in fiscal Q1?",1
"And so, I'd see that is opportunity. Do I think it has anything, does to length to consistency? I think part of it is and I believe that the iPhone upgrade plans that are out there as I've mentioned before it seems to me on the future. We'll tell itâs true or not, but it seems to me itâs going to act as a catalyst to accelerate some of this upgrades. And I think that's not something that we're going to see this quarter or next quarter, but it seems like itâs going to happen beginning a year for now or so.",1
"Okay. And then just a follow-up, as Luca mentioned, you had to make some adjustments to the pricing in various regions given the currency move we've had. What had been the response in terms of demand, I guess both in terms of units and revenues in some of these regions like Japan or India, parts of Europe where the local prices has to go up?",1
"It have begins to be â you've seen the plan. They look more and active like a subscription than they do like a purchase. And that's great for the customer because many of them want to upgrade on a frequent basis and they can do this very, very simply. In terms of new, I don't know, whether we'll more new or not. I can tell you that that's always our objective. We want to add a lot more people to the ecosystem and certainly if you look in the emerging markets, even like, nobody is asking about iPad on the call. But if you look at iPad as just an example, in China, 68% of the people that purchased an iPad it was the first tablet they've owned and 40% of those have never owned any Apple product.",1
"Just to go through one product with one set of number. I don't want to get through a bunch of numbers because it does contain the data than I don't want to share. But these are things that we're very focused on. And the first time buyer number is surprisingly strong. And keep in mind that we have a good history of bunch of people buy one Apple product, they have a great experience. They begin to look at other Apple products. And of course we makes they all work well together.",1
"Thank you, Steve. Could we have next question, please?",1
"From Goldman Sachs, we'll go to Simona Jankowski.",1
"Hi. Thank you very much. Just is a follow-up to that last question and to put that in context, roughly what percent of the iPhone shipments come from shipments for the installed based versus from your user shipment?",1
I don't know the answer of your question.,1
"Simona, we've made a number of price changes during the course of fiscal 2015. What we've seen in a normal of these markets, we've seen that iPhone sales have been very resilient and that shown in our growth rates. Most recently we've adjusted some prices around the world for the launch of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. We are very positive about the safest trends around the world. Itâs a bit early to tell, because the phones have out there just for four weeks, so its bit early to tell there. Obviously when we increase prices around the world, it's normal to see some impact on sales rates, but so far we were encouraged by the response.",1
"While itâs different from a year ago very significantly with the foreign exchange impact that we have mentioned before it remains a very significant headwind as I mentioned earlier to Tony I believe we are dealing with that to a combination of hedging, price realignments [ph] cost initiatives, but on a net basis foreign exchange we will clearly by a sequential headwind.",1
"Let me go back to your question. And this is an exactly what you're asking that what your view, I think some color is. The reason I can't answer this is, we don't look at any aggregate, we actually look at the detailed because it's much more important for to us to look at, buy iPhone model by country, what percentage going to our first iPhone buyers. Somebody that's never owned an iPhone before. And so if you look at China as an example, it's over 50% of people that bought 6 and 6 Plus were buying their first iPhone.",1
"As you move down the line, that numbers goes up. And so a 5s generally speaking is higher in most countries. And so, that gives a feel for very important market and we cannot where the numbers are.",1
Next we'll go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.,1
"Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. Two questions from me as well. I guess, first could you talk about the gross margin dynamic as you go from September to December, the midpoint implies on 20 basis points. I think the last five years that's only happen once the gross margin is going down in fiscal Q1. Can you just talk about what the FX dynamic or what area the other headwinds that you think that implies gross margins being done in December?",1
"Yes. Let me give you puts and takes for margins for the December quarter. On the positive side, of course as you mentioned that we would have positive leverage from the higher seasonal volumes. Also what we've seen over the last several quarters is a commodity environment that has been quite favorable and we expect it to remain favorable during the December quarter.",1
"On the other hand, of course we are launching a lot of new products. Weâve launched some during September. We are launching some now and everything we launch new products, we make them better. We had features and new technology and these products when we launch and tend to have higher cost structures than the products what they replaced. We have a very good track record overtime to reduce those cost structures, but every time we introduce a new product that is a headwind at the beginning of the cycle for gross margin.",1
"We also look at the number of people that have upgraded, that were in the installed base prior to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. And that number is in the low 30 percentages. So we feel like we have a very open field in front of us. Our performance in emerging markets although itâs quite good and our revenue was good our market share is low and the LTE penetration in these markets is quite low.",1
"Zooming out to the more macro question about growth, hereâs what I see currently. We believe that iPhone will grow in Q1 and we base that on what we are seeing from a switcher point of view, we recorded the highest rate on record for Android switches last quarter at 30%.",1
"Katy, itâs Tim. You have to consider the constant currency growth rates. And so if you do that, our guidance is actually 8% to 11% because we have about a 700 basis point FX headwind in Q1. And so the growth is actually quite good underneath that and thatâs obviously a problem with everyone struggling with it.",1
Revenue in Greater China nearly doubled year-over-year and we continue to focus and invest heavily there. I just returned from a four day visit to Hangzhou and Beijing where we announced major new initiatives to provide renewable energy for our supply chain. I also visited our retail stores in China which are among the busiest in the world.,1
"We are seeing strong interest around the world and weâve been getting great feedback from customers who love the iPhoneâs new features including 3D touch, live photos, the new iSight camera, and the powerful new A-9 processor in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.",1
We exited the quarter with demand for our new iPhones exceeding supply but weâve made good progress with our manufacturing ramp in the initial weeks of October. We sold an all time record 5.7 million Macs continuing to defy the negative trend in the global personal computer market which IDC estimates contracted by 11%.,1
The App Store set new all-time quarterly records for both the number of transacting customers and overall revenue. The strong performance of the App Store helped fuel $5.1 billion in services revenue also an all-time record.,1
"Sales of Apple Watch were also up sequentially and were ahead of our expectations. This quarter we introduced beautiful new Apple Watch cases and bands including new Gold and Rose Gold aluminum Apple Watch Sport models. We released Watch OS 2 in September paving the way for a whole new class of native apps that are faster and can take advantage of the hardware capabilities of Apple Watch such as the microphone, speaker and the heart rate sensor.",1
"Today, there are over 13,000 apps in the Watch App Store including over 1300 native apps such as Facebook messenger, MLB At Bat and Runkeeper and the number is growing rapidly.",1
Apple Watch has already had a tremendous effect on customersâ health and fitness and the stories weâre hearing about its impact are truly inspirational. I personally heard from people who credit Apple Watch with saving their lives and customers are finding new applications all the time in their day to day activities.,1
"On Saturday we opened a new store, our 25th in Greater China to a very enthusiastic crowd and we are on track to achieve our goal of 40 stores by the middle of next year. Yesterday, we started taking orders for the all new Apple TV and it was a huge first day for this exciting new product. We want to provide the same innovation in the living room that we delivered in our iOS devices. People are already watching more TV through apps today and we think apps represent the future of TV. Weâve built a new foundation around this vision with a new operating system called tvOS innovative ways to connect with your screen and a smart use of Siri to search for what to watch.",1
We also completed 15 acquisitions to enhance and accelerate our roadmap for products and services. We accomplished all of these things while intensifying our efforts to protect the environment to promote equality and human rights and to ensure the security and privacy we know our customers deserve.,1
"Next month, weâll begin shipping iPad Pro, the most powerful iPad weâve ever made. iPad Pro will enable a new generation of apps for entertainment and productivity, design and illustration, engineering and medical and much more, and with the Apple Pencil and Smart keyboards users can customize their experience making iPad Pro an even more powerful tool for everyone from students to artists, to business professionals.",1
iOS 9 has hit the ground running on track to be downloaded by more users than any software release in Appleâs history with 61% of active iOS devices already running at less than six weeks after its September the 16th release.,1
"In late September, we also launched OS X El Capitan which has made the world most advanced desktop operating system more refined and powerful than ever before. Apple Music has set a completely new standard, redefining and combining the best ways to enjoy music in a single immersive app. Over 15 million individual and family accounts are experiencing Apple music including over 6.5 million paying customers. We are thrilled to bring Apple Music to China beginning this quarter along with iTunes, movies and iBooks and we are especially happy to offer such great new and diverse content to our large highly engaged and rapidly growing customer base in China.",1
We are also looking forward to bringing Apple Music to the new Apple TV beginning this week. Apple Pay is seeing double digit growth in transaction month after month and we continue to add major businesses including Starbucks which will roll out Apple Pay support to all its U.S. stores in 2016.,1
"Apple Pay now supports merchant rewards programs as well and popular retailers that will be coming online in the next few weeks. We are thrilled to announce today that we are partnering with American Express to bring Apple Pay to eligible customers in key global markets so even more people can experience the easy, secure and private way to pay.",1
"Apple Pay will be available to eligible American Express customers in Australia, in Canada this year and is expected to expand to Spain, Singapore and Hong Kong in 2016. The reach of our ecosystem continues to grow and iOS is changing more and more aspects of our customerâs lives in very meaningful ways from their health, to their homes, to their cars.",1
We are ending the year on a high note with a record breaking September quarter including sales of 48 million iPhones beating our expectations and up 22% year-over-year. Momentum for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus remained very strong across the quarter and we established a new launch record for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus near the end of the quarter.,1
"We also entered an entirely new category with Apple Watch and we are in the very early innings of this promising new part of our business. We generated over $53 billion dollars in net income and grew earnings per share by 43%. We returned almost $50 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while continuing to invest confidently in research and development, marketing and distribution, our retail and online stores, our supply chain and our infrastructure.",1
"The impact of research kit also continues to build. We recently announced new studies on autism, epilepsy and melanoma adding to the important studies already underway on conditions from asthma to diabetes to Parkinsonâs disease.",1
And these replays will be available by approximately 5.00 PM Pacific Time today. Members of the press can contact Kristin Fugate and financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Thanks again for joining us.,1
"And broadly speaking, how does that number change at least your guess as you look out over the next couple quarters given the launch of the 6 and the 6 Plus.",1
"For iPhone I really have it by model from the June quarter and as I had mentioned before, the highest percentage is the 4s buyer in China over 80% of the people were buying their first iPhone.",1
"And for a 5s in China, 50% were and so I think what that says. Those numbers are so high, the 80 that I think are great -- my gut tells me, a great percentage of 6 and 6 Plus buyers will eventually -- a great percentage of those will be new to iPhone. That's what I would predict.",1
Okay. That's it for me guys. Thank you.,1
"Thank you, Keith.",1
"Thank Keith. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone and the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and please enter a confirmation code 1997837.",1
"Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1
"We crossed 100 billion cumulative downloads from the App Store and we added powerful new services to our ecosystem, including Apple Pay in the United States, in the United Kingdom, Apple Music in over a 100 countries, and Apple News in the U.S.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri, after that we'll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2014, the Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2015 and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release.",1
Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speaks as of their respective dates.,1
"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we are reporting a very strong finish to a record breaking year and Iâd like to reflect on some of the highlights.",1
"We completed our fiscal year in September, and we are proud to report revenue of $234 billion, an increase of 28% and $51 billion over 2014. This is our largest absolute revenue growth ever. To put that into some context, our growth in one year was greater than the full year revenue of almost 90% of the companies in the Fortune 500. We made huge inroads into emerging markets generating over $79 billion in revenue and growing 63% despite very strong headwinds from foreign exchange rates.",1
"These results are made possible by Appleâs commitment to innovation and creating the best products on earth. In the past 12 months around the world weâve sold over 300 million devices including 231 million iPhones, 55 million iPads and 21 million Macs setting new unit records and increasing our global market share for both iPhone and Mac.",1
"In Health, there are now more than 1,600 health kit enabled solutions that are helping us live a healthier day. In the home there are over 50 brands working on home kit enabled accessories that can be privately and securely controlled from your iPad and iPhone, and in the car more than 50 automobile models have been announced with CarPlay support which provides a smarter, safer and more fun way to use iPhone in the car. And we will continue to work to make the iOS experience even more meaningful across more touch points of our daily lives.",1
"Our iOS news app is off to a great start. Nearly 40 million people are reading Apple news and weâve been getting very positive feedback from the publishers. We have now signed more than 70 publishers representing hundreds of titles and weâre happy to announce that news just launched in the United Kingdom and Australia with partners such as the BBC, NewsCorp, The Telegraph, The Guardian, Financial Times, Daily Mail and the Australian Broadcasting Service.",1
"Yes, thanks, good afternoon. In light of December quarter revenue guidance, firmly low single digit revenue growth and what looks like increasingly tough comps heading into the March quarter, how do you get comfortable that Apple isnât on the verge of [ex] [ph] growth for the first time in a decade? And then I have a follow up.",1
"Third, also in September we lengthened the time period over which the deferred revenue associated to iPads will be recognized from two years to three years.",1
"Revenue from other products grew strongly up 61% over last year, thanks to the growing contribution from Apple Watch. We expanded Apple Watch distribution significantly over the course of the quarter and it was available at almost 5000 locations in 32 countries at quarter end.",1
"Our retail and online stores had a very busy quarter. We opened 7 new stores, including our first store in Belgium. That brought us to a global store count of 463 of which 195 are in 15 countries outside the United States.",1
"In fiscal 2016, we expect to open or replace between 40 and 50 stores and we continue to place particular emphasis on Greater China where we plan to have 40 stores opened by the middle of next year.",1
Customers have been very interested in the iPhone upgrade program offered in our U.S. retail stores. The iPhone upgrade program gives customer purchasing a connected device an easy convenient way to get a new phone every year with low monthly payments to a third party lender along with the security and protection of AppleCare Plus.,1
"After making 12 or more installment payments, customers can upgrade to a new iPhone. Let me also quickly discuss three accounting matters. First, relative to the iPhone upgrade program that I just mentioned, we will be reducing revenue at the time of sale for the cost associated with the program and deferring the portion of revenue related to AppleCare software upgrade rights and non software services for each iPhone sold.",1
"Second, in September based on an analysis of market offerings we reduced the estimated selling price of future software upgrade rights and non software services that we defer for each iOS device and Mac sold, the reduction is between $5 and $10 per unit.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $205.7 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $2.8 billion. $187 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside of the United States. In the September quarter, we issued a total of $5.8 billion of term debt, consisting of 1.25 billion British pound denominated notes, 2.25 billion Australian dollar denominated notes and 2 billion euro denominated notes.",1
"Our mobility partner program also continues to grow with more than 25 new partners added in the September quarter bringing the total to over 65 and we are already seeing some great success stories with this program. We are also very excited about the potential of iPad Pro and the enterprise. For example, with the Bloomberg professional app, more than 325,000 financial professionals will be able to use iPad Pro to gain instant global access to finance and business news, market data and portfolio tracking and trading tools.",1
This left us with $56 billion of term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter.,1
We were very active in the market during the quarter and returned over $17 billion to our investors. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $14 billion to repurchase almost 122 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also completed our fifth accelerated share repurchase program in July and retired an additional 10 million shares at settlement.,1
"We have now completed over $143 billion of our $200 billion program including $104 billion in share repurchases of which $36 billion was repurchased in fiscal 2015 alone. Now, as we move ahead into December quarter, I like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $75.5 and $77.5 billion compared to $74.6 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 39% and 40%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.3 billion and $6.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.2%.",1
"Also today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock payable on November 12, 2015 to shareholders of record as of November 09, 2015.",1
"Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?",1
[Operation Instructions] Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Turning to services. We generated $5.1 billion in revenue, a new all-time record, and an increase of 10% over last year mainly due to strong growth from apps. The revenue from the App Store increased 25% and the number of transacting customers grew 18%, also setting an all-time record. Services growth was particularly impressive in China, where Apple App Store revenue grew by 127% year-over-year. The momentum behind the App Store in China has been tremendous with huge interest from developers and customers alike. Our developer program in China has grown dramatically in the last year with over 1 million members in our program today.",1
"There are now 55 apps in the IBM mobile first for iOS catalogue and the list of projects signings is growing rapidly. Inside IBM, Macs are gaining tremendous traction. There are currently over 30,000 Macs deployed within the company with 1,900 more being added each week. IBM tells us that each Mac is saving $270 compared to a traditional PC, thanks to the much reduced support cost and better residual value. This is a terrific example of the kind of opportunity our devices offer to improve user experience and create value in the enterprise world.",1
"And finally, we are making great strides in the enterprise market, announcing a new strategic partnership with Cisco in September while furthering our progress with IBM in building our mobility partners program. We estimate that enterprise markets accounted for about $25 billion in annual Apple revenue in the last 12 months, up 40% over the prior year and they represent a major growth vector for the future.",1
"For details by product I'll start with iPhone. We sold 48 million iPhones in the quarter, up 22% year over year with strong performance around the world throughout the quarter. Total iPhone sales were up 120% in Mainland China and grew over 35% in South Asia and increased by over 20% in several markets around the world including Germany and Italy.",1
"Iâd like to thank our talented and incredibly hardworking employees, our developers and our business partners around the world and of course our very loyal customers for making 2015 Applesâ most successful year yet.",1
"With that, Iâll turn the call over to Luca to go over the September quarter results in more detail.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Itâs great to conclude our record fiscal 2015 with our strongest September quarter ever. Revenue for the quarter was $51.5 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion or 22% year over year. Our growth was driven by the tremendous performance of iPhone, the expanded availability of Apple Watch and all time high services revenue and Mac sales.",1
We achieved these outstanding results despite severe and persisting weakness in foreign exchange rates around the world that affected all our geographic segments and this makes our year-over-year growth rates even more remarkable.,1
"In constant currency, our growth during the fourth quarter would have been 800 basis points higher. We once again reported very strong numbers in Greater China with revenue growing 99% year-over-year to $12.5 billion. Emerging markets performance was strong overall up 65% year-over-year and representing 31% of total company revenue for the quarter.",1
"Company gross margin was 39.9%, up sequentially better than our expectations, mainly due to lower than expected costs. Operating margin was 28.4% of revenue and net income was $11.1 billion, a new September quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $1.96, a 38% year-over-year increase and cash flow from operations was $13.5 billion, also a new fourth quarter record.",1
"iPhone ASP was $670, an increase of $67 year-over-year, thanks to more favorable mix and in spite of the very significant negative impact from foreign exchange that I referred to earlier.",1
"Also, during the September quarter, IBM released new mobile first for iOS apps in healthcare, financial services, travel and transportation and industrial sectors, including new apps leveraging iOS 9 and Watch OS 2.",1
We increased iPhone channel inventory by less than 2 million units in order to support our new product launch at the very end of September quarter. We exited the quarter with demand exceeding supply and channel inventory below our target range of 5 to 7 weeks.,1
"Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.7 million Macs, which is an all time quarterly record and represents 3% year-over-year growth. We extended our very long running trend of PC market share gains based on IDC's latest estimate of a 11% global market contraction. Mac growth was driven primarily by the great customer response to our new MacBook and sales of MacBook Pro also remained strong. We ended the quarter below our 4 to 5 week target range for Mac channel inventory.",1
"Turning to iPad. We sold 9.9 million compared to 12.3 million in the year-ago quarter. iPad sell-through was 10.4 million as we reduced channel inventory by about 500,000 units. We exited the quarter below our 5 to 7 week target range of iPad channel inventory.",1
"iPad customer metrics remain extremely positive. In August, ChangeWave measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2 and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, 70% planned to purchase an iPad. Corporate buyers reported a 95% satisfaction rate for iPad and a 90 day purchase intent of 73%.",1
"In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be very successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 73% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by IDC indicates that iPad has 74% share of the U.S. Commercial Tablet market.",1
As Tim mentioned our enterprise initiatives continue to expand. In September we announced a new strategic partnership with Cisco to optimize their networks for iOS devices with a goal of providing iOS mobile users with great performance advantage over other mobile platforms.,1
"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week, we're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations.",1
"Our results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range. We sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters, as we forecasted in January. iPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets.",1
"As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal customers in the world, and fiscal 2016 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before. This is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other company can match.",1
"Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thank you, Rod.",1
"Great. Okay, thank you.",1
"A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone, and your numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820.

And that does conclude today's presentation. We do thank everyone for your participation.,1
"Good day everyone and welcome to this Apple Inc. Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1
"Thank you, good afternoon, and thanks everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri, and after that we'll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. As we closed the books on a very successful fiscal 2017, I have to say I couldn't be more excited about Apple's future. This was our biggest year ever in most parts of the world with all-time record revenue in the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Korea, the Middle East, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and Asia. We had particularly strong finish this year, generating our highest September quarter revenue ever as year-over-year growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. Revenue was $52.6 billion, above the high end of our guidance range, and up 12% over last year. We generated revenue growth across all of our product categories and showed all-time record results for our Services business.",1
"Okay. Great. Thanks, Luca. And then, Tim, I wanted you to ask you, this question comes up once in a while, but I just wanted to ask you if you could talk to us a little bit about the arguments on both sides of the dividend question. I mean, Apple seems to be perpetually undervalued. It's a very large company. It's getting harder and harder to grow. Your payout ratio is significantly below the S&P 500. I know you can't tell us what your intentions are here, but if you could help us understand how that thinking around the dividend works, it would be great.",1
"As we expected, we returned to growth in greater China, with unit growth and market share gains for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. In fact, it was an all-time record quarter for Mac sales in mainland China as well as an all-time high for Services revenue. And revenue from emerging markets outside of greater China was up 40%, with great momentum in India, where revenue doubled year over year. We also had great results in enterprise and education with double digit growth in worldwide customer purchases of iPad and Mac in both markets.",1
"Gross margin for the September quarter was at the high end of our guidance range, and thanks to exceptional work by our teams, we generated record fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.07, up 24% from a year ago. iPhone sales exceeded our expectations. In the last week and a half of September, we began shipping iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus to customers in more than 50 countries. They instantly became our two most popular iPhone models and have been every week since then.",1
"As we speak, the launch of iPhone X is now underway as stores open across Australia and Asia. iPhone X is packed with innovative new technologies that chart our path for the next decade, technologies like the TrueDepth camera system, Super Retina Display, and A11 Bionic chip with neural engine, which has been in development for years with a focus on deep machine learning. iPhone X enables totally new experiences like unlocking your iPhone with Face ID, taking photos with studio-quality lighting effects, or playing immersive augmented reality games. We can't wait for people to experience our vision of the future. Orders have already been very strong, and we're working to get iPhone X into customers' hands as quickly as possible.",1
"Turning to Services. Revenue reached an all-time quarterly record of $8.5 billion in the September quarter. A few quarters ago, we established a goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue of $24 billion by the year 2020, and we are well on our way to meeting that goal. In fiscal 2017, we reached $30 billion, making our Services business already the size of a Fortune 100 company.",1
"We're also delighted to report our second consecutive quarter of double-digit unit growth for iPad. Customers have responded very positively to the new iPad lineup. And with the launch of iOS 11, the iPad experience has become more powerful than ever, with great new features for getting things done like the new dock, Files app, drag and drop, multitasking and more power than most PC notebooks.",1
"The launch of iOS 11 also made iOS the world's largest platform for augmented reality. There are already over 1,000 apps with powerful AR features in our App Store today, with developers creating amazing new experiences in virtually every category of apps aimed at consumers, students and business users alike. Put simply, we believe AR is going to change the way we use technology forever.",1
"We review the capital return annually, and we've established a cadence now to announce our thinking on that every April. And so we have a robust discussion around the dividend and the buyback. We very much believe that Apple is very undervalued, and so we're investing with confidence in the company that we know really well. And so that thinking has I think proven out over time and I think been very good for our shareholders. And in addition to that, we know that some shareholders really like a dividend and some ongoing income, and so we've provided a amount that we think is a good amount and have a good track record of raising it annually. And so we'll be able to say more on that I'm sure in April of next year.",1
"It is very, very important I think for investors to understand that what's happened during the last two years. During the last two years, the U.S. dollar has appreciated by 15% over the basket of currencies where we do business. And we're a company that generates two thirds of our revenues outside the United States, 15% appreciation of the U.S. dollar. So on a year-over-year basis, just 2016 over 2015 was 340 bps impact from foreign exchange. This is something that we have offset almost entirely through a number of initiatives going from pricing actions to cost initiatives to our hedging program, but at some point, the strong dollar becomes the new normal and we need to work with that. And I think over the years, we made very good trade-offs and our gross margins have been quite stable over time.",1
"iOS 11 is also allowing developers to integrate machine learning models into their apps with Core ML. Pinterest is already using Core ML to deliver fast and powerful visual search. PadMapper uses Core ML to provide intelligent features that make it easy to find or rent your apartment. And VisualDx is even pioneering new health diagnostics with Core ML, automating skin image analysis to assist dermatologists with their diagnoses. These are just a few examples. There's so much more to come.",1
"The smartphone has not done as well in India in general. However, one of the key reasons for that is the infrastructure hasn't been there. But this year or this year and next year, there are enormous investments going in on 4G and we couldn't be more excited about that because it really takes a great network working with iPhone to produce that great experience for people. And so I see a lot of the factors moving in the right direction there. I also think the government is much more focused on the infrastructure and on creating jobs, which is fantastic, because you really need the kind of infrastructure and the technology to do that.",1
"We clearly saw that this year. There's a lot of competition for customers in the U.S. which I think is the market that you're talking about. Whether that'll happen every two years, I don't know. But I suspect that any time there are large numbers of customers that have a phone that's in that two year kind of range that it tends to be a sweet spot, and I think you probably will see a lot of people trying to recruit those customers.",1
Yeah. Thank you.,1
Jim Suva with Citi.,1
"Thank you very much. A strategy question for Tim and then more of a financial question for Luca. Tim, you'd mentioned in your prepared comments a little bit about India and we've been doing a lot of work talking about the opportunity in India. And we get a lot of pushback talking about disposable income metrics and lots of things like that, yet the population being so large, can you talk a little bit about, do you see that India could at some point be as big of an opportunity as China? And it appears that the legal rules have kind of prevented you from going in a lot, but it looks like that's changing. Can you just kind of give us a little more clarity on India?",1
"And then, Tim, for the clarification questions, is it fair to say that the OpEx has a disproportionate more expense side with the 14th week that we should kind of think of maybe as we go forward, that we shouldn't expect the OpEx to kind of be chugging along at that high rate? Or is it just kind of the rate of investing that you're going? Thank you very much, gentlemen.",1
"Yeah, thanks for the question. I'll let Luca talk about the OpEx piece of it. On India, I think it's important to look not only at per capita income, which may be what you're looking at, but sort of look at the number of people that are or will move into the middle class sort of over the next decade. And the age of the population, if you look at India, almost 50% of the population is under 25. And so you have a very, very young population.",1
"Will it be as big as China? I think it's clear that the population of India will exceed China sometime in probably the next decade or so, maybe less than that. I think it will take longer for the GDP to rival it, but that's not critical for us to have a great success there. The truth is, there's going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those. And given our starting point, even though we've been growing a lot, there is a lot of headroom there in our mind, and so we are working very hard to realize that opportunity.",1
"On a year-over-year basis, keep in mind that last year we did, in Q1, we did 40%, around 40%, 40%, 41%, but there's a couple of things that I think need to be considered before doing a year-over-year compare. And it's the fact that last year we had this award for a patent infringement of $548 million. That is, at the gross margin level, is 40 bps. And then we've got the FX situation, which I mentioned before, which is worth another 60 bps, 70 bps. And so you're left with less than 100 basis points deterioration on a year-over-year basis where again, we have the reality of new cost structures into our products.",1
"And, Jim, on OpEx, our approach to OpEx is quite clear and quite simple. We want to continue to invest in the business in all the areas where we think is critical for us to invest. So you see that we make significant investments in R&D. You've seen the growth rates over the last couple of years. We are making important investments in data centers because we want to support our services business. We continue to open retail stores around the world. We continue to invest in marketing and advertising. At the same time, we want to continue to be efficient and lean. It's something that we've done very well over the years and want to continue to do that.",1
"So what you've seen, for example in fiscal 2016, you've seen investments in R&D growing at 25% and then our SG&A expenses to be about flat. And this is kind of the approach that we want to take and continue to take going forward. If you step back for a second and you look at our implied guidance for the December quarter, we got an expense to revenue ratio of 9%. This is extremely competitive in our industry and I would say in general. And so we want to continue to have this balance, make the right investments and remain efficient.",1
"Thank you, and congratulations and thanks for the details, gentleman.",1
"Thank you, Jim. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I had one for Luca and then a follow-up for Tim. So, Luca, I wanted to ask about the gross margin guidance. I think that the Street and we were expecting something a little bit higher. And again, that's about 50 basis points lower and the Street it was I think 70 basis points lower. And I'm just curious, do you think that people are mis-modeling that or is there something going on with pricing or mix there that you could provide us more color on? So that's my first question.",1
"Yeah, Rod, let me give you some detail both on a sequential basis and I'll give you also something on a year-over-year basis because maybe that's where the disconnect comes from, looking at the last year's gross margins in the December quarter. On a sequential basis, we are essentially guiding to some improvement in gross margins. We had 38% both in the June quarter and in the September quarter. We're guiding slightly higher for the December quarter because on the positive, we're going to have of course better leverage and the mix in the December quarter tends to be better. But we need to keep into account the fact that these positives are going to be partially offset by the cost structures of the new products that we are launching now and we've launched already a few during the September quarter and that will have an impact on our December quarter results.",1
"We're already seeing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn. For example, there are AR apps that let you interact with virtual models of everything you can imagine, from the human body to the solar system. And of course, you experience them like they're really there. Instantly, education becomes much more powerful when every subject comes to life in 3D. And imagine shopping when you can place an object in your living room before you make a purchase, or attending live sporting events when you can see the stats on the field. AR is going to change everything.",1
"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac, which had its best year ever, with the highest annual Mac revenue in Apple's history. It was also the best September quarter ever, with Mac revenue growth of 25% driven by the notebook refreshes we launched in June and a strong back-to-school season. The Mac experience has become even better since the September launch of macOS High Sierra, with new technologies to make Mac more reliable, capable and responsive and lay the foundation for future innovation.",1
"If I can add, Wamsi, keep in mind that in a lot of countries around the world, the reality is that our customers have seen some significant price increases because of the FX situation, right. And that's something that we need to keep in mind as well.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $268.9 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $7.4 billion. $252.3 billion of this cash, 94% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion in new Canadian and U.S. dollar denominated debt during the quarter, bringing us to $104 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding.",1
"NPD indicates that iPad had 54% share of the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter, including seven of the 10 best-selling tablets. That's up from 47% share a year ago. Also, the most recent surveys from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction rates of 97% across iPad models. And among people planning to buy tablets, purchase intent for iPad was over 70% for both consumers and businesses.",1
"We are seeing great momentum with our enterprise initiatives. During the September quarter, we announced a new partnership with Accenture, who is creating a dedicated iOS practice in select locations around the world. Experts from Apple are co-locating with this team and together they'll be launching new tools and services that help enterprise clients transform how they engage with customers using iPhone and iPad.",1
Examples include services to build new customer experiences and to facilitate iOS integration with enterprise systems to help businesses take greater advantage of data from Internet of Things platforms and to enable the smooth transfer of existing legacy applications and data to modern iOS apps.,1
"And last month, we announced a partnership with GE to reinvent the way industrial companies work by bringing GE's industrial IoT platform to iOS. The (20:37) SDK for iOS will enable developers to build native apps to drive industrial operations with more efficiency and speed than ever before. GE is also standardizing on iPhone and iPad for its global workforce of more than 330,000 employees and working with Apple, GE is developing iOS apps for both its internal and external audiences to bring predictive data and analytics to workers across a broad range of industries.",1
"Beyond our iOS devices, we are also seeing great traction for Mac in the enterprise market with all-time record customer purchases in fiscal year 2017.",1
"The September quarter was very strong for our retail and online stores, which welcomed 418 million visitors. Traffic was particularly heavy during the week of our new product announcements, up 19% over last year. Retail ran a very successful back-to-school promotion in the Americas, Europe, China and Singapore, with sales of Mac and iPad Pro up strong double digits compared to last year's program. And around the world, our stores conducted over 200,000 Today at Apple sessions during the quarter.",1
"We also returned $11 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.3 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $4.5 billion on repurchases of 29.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched a new $3 billion ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 15.1 million shares and we retire 4.5 million shares upon the completion of our 11th ASR during the quarter. We have now completed almost $234 billion of our $300 billion capital return program, including $166 billion in share repurchases.",1
"Next, I would like to talk about the Mac, which for fiscal 2017 set a new all-time revenue record of $25.8 billion. We sold 5.4 million Macs during the September quarter, up 10% over last year and gained significant market share as the global market contracted by 1% based on IDC's latest estimate. This performance was fueled primarily by great demand for MacBook Pro and Mac revenue grew 25% to a new September quarter record. We had outstanding results all around the world with each of our geographic segments growing Mac revenue by 20% or more. We were also very happy with the success of Mac in the education market where customer purchases grew double digits year over year.",1
"As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. As a reminder, the December quarter in fiscal 2017 spanned 14 weeks, whereas the December quarter this year will include the usual 13 weeks.",1
"We expect revenue to be between $84 billion and $87 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $7.65 billion and $7.75 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $600 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. Also, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable on November 16, 2017, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2017.",1
"Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Luca, when do you expect to catch up with iPhone X demand? And given it's likely to be not in the December quarter, should we think about March as a better than seasonal revenue quarter because of that iPhone X ramp? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"I'll take that, Katy. It's Tim. The ramp for iPhone X is going well, especially considering that iPhone X is the most advanced iPhone we've ever created and it has lots of new technologies in it. And so we're really happy that we were able to increase week by week what we're outputting and we're going to get as many of them as possible to the customers as soon as possible. I can't predict, at this point, when that balance will happen. And in terms of March, we obviously don't give guidance beyond the current quarter.",1
"Okay. And then China growth returned to strong double digits, 12% up. You've talked historically about that region being more sensitive than others to form factor changes and the new iPhone X form factor was not available in September. And so should we assume that growth in that region only accelerates from here as that new product gets pushed into the market.",1
"Let me talk a little bit about Q4 in China to give you a little bit of color on the results. We increased market share for iPhone, Mac and iPad during the quarter. We hit all-time revenue records for Services and for Mac for the PRC during the quarter. We've had very strong iPad revenue growth. We had double digit unit growth in iPhone and both the upgraders and Android switchers were both up on a year over year basis during the quarter, and so the results were broad based. They were pretty much across the board, as I indicated.",1
"It was also another great quarter for iPad. We sold 10.3 million units, up 11% over last year with strong demand for both iPad and iPad Pro and revenue grew 14%. It was great to see iPad unit and revenue growth in all of our geographic segments and particularly strong results in emerging markets, including greater China, where iPad units sales were up 25% year-over-year and India, which grew 39%.",1
"Apple Pay expanded to Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the UAE last month and continues to grow rapidly. Over the past year, active users have more than doubled and annual transactions are up 330%. In the U.S., 70% of leading grocery chains are now accepting Apple Pay with the recent launch of Safeway and over 5 million U.S. merchant locations will be Apple Pay enabled by the end of this year.",1
"Moving on now to Apple Watch. With unit growth of over 50% for the third consecutive quarter, it continues to be the best selling and most loved smartwatch in the world. We began shipping Apple Watch Series 3 just six weeks ago and customers love the new freedom of cellular. The ability to go for a run with just your Apple Watch or go for a quick errand without your phone while staying connected is a game changer. Now more than ever, Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life and is already making a big difference in our customers' lives. We're very excited about the upcoming launch of the Apple Heart Study, which will use data from Apple Watch to identify irregular heart rhythms and notify users when unusual patterns are detected.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was a record $52.6 billion, up 12% over last year, and it has been great to see our growth rate accelerate in every quarter of fiscal 2017. Our terrific performance this quarter was very broad based, with revenue growth in all our product categories for the second quarter in a row and new September quarter revenue records in the Americas, in Europe and in the rest of Asia-Pacific segments.",1
"Earlier this week, we introduced watchOS 4.1, bringing 40 million songs to your wrist through Apple Music. The combination of music streaming on Apple Watch and AirPods is truly a magical experience for people on the go. We're thrilled with the momentum of these products. In fact, our entire wearables business was up 75% year over year in the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2017, already generated the annual revenue of a Fortune 400 company.",1
"Late in the September quarter, we also launched Apple TV 4K, delivering a stunning cinematic experience at home. So now users around the world can watch movies and shows in 4K HDR quality and stream live sports and news on the Apple TV app. There's already a great selection of 4K HDR titles available through iTunes and other popular video services with many more movies and shows on the way.",1
"We're also very excited about the opening of Apple Michigan Avenue two weeks ago on Chicago's riverfront. This is the first store that brings together our complete vision for the future of Apple retail, providing a welcoming place for everyone to experience our products, services and inspiring educational programs right in the heart of their city. In addition to our very popular Today at Apple programming, which is available in all Apple Stores around the world, offering daily sessions in photography, music creation, art and design, coding and entrepreneurship, Apple Michigan Avenue is partnering with local nonprofits and creative organizations to make an ongoing positive impact in that community.",1
"Also this quarter, we expanded our free App Development with Swift curriculum to more than 30 community colleges across the country. We're very excited about this initiative, and we're thrilled by the momentum we're seeing. The schools we've launched with this summer are just the beginning. Community colleges have a powerful reach into communities where education is the great equalizer, and the colleges adopting our curriculum this academic year are providing opportunity to millions of students to build apps that will prepare them for careers in software development and information technology and much more.",1
"We're incredibly enthusiastic about what our teams have accomplished this year and all the amazing products in our lineup. As we approach the holiday season, we expect it to be our biggest quarter ever. I'd like to thank all of our teams, our partners and our customers for their passion, commitment and loyalty. You've helped us make 2017 a sensational year.",1
"Now for more details on the September quarter results, I'd like to turn over the call to Luca.",1
"We grew double digits in the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Korea and several other developed markets. We were especially happy to return to growth in greater China, where revenue was up 12% from a year ago and with our momentum in India, where revenue doubled year-over-year. We grew more than 30% in Mexico, the Middle East, Turkey and Central and Eastern Europe. These results have fueled overall growth of over 20% from emerging markets.",1
"Across all of our Services offerings, the number of paid subscriptions reached over 210 million at the end of September quarter, an increase of 25 million in the last 90 days.",1
"Gross margin was 37.9%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 25% of revenue and net income was $10.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.07, up 24% over last year to a new September quarter record and cash flow from operations was strong at $15.7 billion.",1
"During the quarter, we sold 46.7 million iPhones, up 3% over last year. We were very pleased to see double digit iPhone growth in many emerging markets including mainland China, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India and Mexico. We gained share not only in those markets but also in Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Singapore, based on the latest estimates from IDC.",1
"iPhone channel inventory increased by 1.3 million units sequentially to support the launch of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, significantly less than the increase in the September quarter a year ago.",1
"Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong with both consumers and business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a customer satisfaction rating of 97% or higher across all iPhone models. Among consumers planning to buy a smartphone in the next 90 days, purchase intention for iPhone was 69%, more than 5 times the rate of the closest competitor with a loyalty rate for current iPhone owners of 95% compared to 53% for the next highest brand. For corporate smartphone buyers, iOS customer satisfaction was 95% and of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 80% planned to purchase iPhone. That is the highest score for iPhone in the history of the survey.",1
"Turning to Services, we set an all-time quarterly record of $8.5 billion, up 34% year over year. Our results included a favorable one-time revenue adjustment of $640 million. On a run rate basis, excluding this adjustment, services growth of 24% was terrific and the highest that we have experienced this year. The App Store set a new all-time record, and according to App Annie's latest report, it continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases by a wide and growing margin, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play. We're getting great response to the App Store's new design in iOS 11 from both customers and developers. We're seeing increases in the frequency of customer visits, the amount of time they spend in the store and the number of apps they download.",1
The success of Apple Music also continues to build and we're seeing our highest conversion rates from customers trying the service. Revenue grew strongly once again in the September quarter and the number of paid subscribers was up over 75% year-over-year. We also saw great performance from our iCloud business with very strong double-digit growth in both monthly average users and revenue.,1
"Great. Thanks. Thanks for the clarification. And Tim, this year we saw carrier incentives come back to force post the launch of the iPhone 7, 7 Plus. Two years ago there was a giant upgrade to iPhone from the iPhone 6, 6 Plus. Do you think every couple of years we are likely to see carrier incentives come back into play given worries around customer churn, thereby making the phone even more affordable? Thanks.",1
"With the iPhone 7 Plus, we put an incredible amount of innovation into the camera and the overall photo experience, and customers are obviously using that and have discovered that they love it. And so we're getting an incredible amount of feedback there. We also get incredible feedback on the iPhone 7. And, but the mix that we projected on iPhone 7 Plus is short of what the reality is and so we are chasing supply there. In terms of the ASP, the way we think about it is we want to charge a fair price and so we don't want to charge more than that, and we think it's worth being fair. And so that's how we look at it.",1
"We had a record-setting quarter for Services, with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion. App Store revenue continued to skyrocket, while Music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple Music. In fact, J.D. Power recently announced that Apple Music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market.",1
"IBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more than 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs have three times the cost to manage, drive twice the number of support calls and are 5 times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs. Thanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing the total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a full-year lifecycle.",1
"Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the U.S. for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found that among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting a 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measured a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating and found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% planned to purchase iPhone.",1
"Turning to Services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App Store growth rate has now accelerated for five consecutive quarters, reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App Store remains the preferred destination for both customers and developers. According to App Annie, it generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance from apps, we saw strong double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically, as Tim mentioned.",1
"Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac installed base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future Mac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four to five week target range for Mac channel inventory.",1
"Turning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with increase driven by the new iPad Pro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five to seven-week target range.",1
"We continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above $200. And in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured, with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter.",1
"In the enterprise market, we are seeing some great examples of iPad and Mac deployment. Our Mobility Partner Program continues to grow stronger, with over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution partner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad based POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations worldwide, including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion. $216 billion of this cash or 91% of the total was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term debt at the end of the quarter.",1
"Worldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 Plus, and we're working very hard to get the new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible.",1
"We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open market transactions, and we launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated share repurchase program, with adding an additional 12.3 million shares. So total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%. We have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $133 billion in share repurchases.",1
"During the September quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8 billion. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a differential graphic mix of earnings relative to our regional expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6%",1
"As we move ahead into the December quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the all-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.",1
"Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders of record as of November 7, 2016.",1
First we'll hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.,1
"Hey, good afternoon and congratulations. And Tim, now that we're a month in the iPhone 7, are you seeing anything measurable in terms of the growing trend of annual upgrades? And second is, historically in terms of new product categories, you guys have always looked for unique advantage before getting into a segment. And I'm curious about the car. There are a lot of rumors out there, and would like your perspective on how you think about an advantage that Apple could add in the auto space?",1
"iPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter, which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we launched iPhone SE and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a level similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year.",1
"We experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, India and South Asia. iPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to iPhone 7 and 7 Plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than our September quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago.",1
"I can't speak about rumors, but as you know, we look for ways that we can improve the experience and the customers' experience on different sets of products. And we are always looking at new things, and the car space in general is an area that it's clear that there is a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionize the car experience. And so it's interesting from that point of view, but nothing to, certainly nothing to announce today.",1
"One of the great new features of iOS 10 is the Home app, which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can easily set up and securely control all their HomeKit accessories, from lights and cameras to the garage doors and air conditioners, all from their favorite iOS devices. We expect over 100 HomeKit-compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple to help ensure customer security when using them. Our Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home.",1
"Earlier this month I visited Japan, where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments where they commute, dine and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong growth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next few months.",1
"Apple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year-on-year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of September than we did across all of fiscal 2015. And with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners tell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet.",1
"We remain very confident about the future of our Services business given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction and loyalty of our growing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our Services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 company in fiscal 2017.",1
"As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance in battery life ever, thanks to the custom-designed Apple A10 Fusion chip. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and come in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly as possible.",1
"We're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smartwatch, packed with new features including built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display and a powerful dual-core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are recognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated and connected. One recent example is Aetna, which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch for individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to encourage them to live a healthier day.",1
"We've just rolled out new versions of iOS, macOS and watchOS and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac, enhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call memories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink and handwritten notes. We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all new App Store for Messages, and there has been a marked increase in our monthly active users.",1
"With our latest operating systems, machine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for years to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily both through R&D and acquisitions. Today, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10, which offers suggestions on which app you might want to use or which context you might want to include in an email. Our camera and photo software uses advanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find. Machine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products.",1
"Gross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue and net income was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67 and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion, which is a new record for the September quarter. For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we increased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five to seven week target range of channel inventory.",1
Machine learning continually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening it to developers and most recently by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra. We're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs and we're very happy with the engagement it's driving with Siri.,1
"Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a a first of its kind all-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country. They're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their network. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity.",1
"We're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership with Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS platform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions across the enterprise. We're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20 industries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping.",1
"As we close the books on another incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our amazing developer community for their relentless creativity and our wonderful customers, business partners and shareholders for their loyalty and support.",1
Now I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.,1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strongly in many emerging markets, including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand and Vietnam, and we continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America.",1
"In terms of iPhone 7, Gene, the carriers that had upgrade plans, the information that we have from them is that demand is very robust. But from a worldwide point of view, the truth is that demand is outstripping supply in the vast majority of places, particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus. And so it's sort of we are in a situation at the moment, it's difficult in the early weeks to be able to differentiate. But on an anecdotal basis, it's clear the upgrade programs are a win.",1
Just one quick follow up in terms of the supply. Do you think we'll be at equilibrium by the end of the quarter for iPhone supplies?,1
"Yes. Thank you. So, Tim and Luca, you saw that you could raise the ASP on the iPhone 7 Plus by $20 and you're completely sold out. So clearly this device plays a central role in our lives, so much that owners probably look at that incremental cost as a great trade-off to get the best device out there. So as you see more and more features being added into iPhones, do you conceptually expect that you are anywhere close to the point where raising ASPs further would be net disruptive to demand? Or do you see more rooms to raise ASPs over time as you add incremental features? And I have a follow up.",1
"In terms of the balance between privacy and AI, this is a long conversation, but at a high level, I think it's a false trade-off that people would like you to believe that you have to give up privacy in order to have AI do something for you. We don't buy that. It may take a different kind of work. It might take more thinking, but I don't think we should throw our privacy away. It's sort of like the age-old argument about privacy versus security. We should have both. It shouldn't be making a choice. And so that at a high level is how we see it.",1
"Thank you. I have a question for Luca and then one for Tim as well. Luca, I wanted to dig into the Services business a bit more. As you pointed out, it accelerated again to 24%. How does that compare to the pace of growth of the installed base, just to help us decouple how much of it is consumption driven on a per user basis versus the base as a whole?",1
"Simona, the installed base number is something that we talk about periodically. The last time we talked about it, it was in the January call. It is growing. Our installed base is growing very well, which is very important for us. It's growing on all major products and it's growing of course in total. When you look at our Services revenue, the growth of the Services revenue has been accelerating during the course of the year during a period when, as you know, our revenue came down slightly.",1
"So what that means in practice is that what we are seeing with our customers that consume our services is that the people that are actually taking advantage of our services over time tend spend more and more on our services. We've got customers that are very engaged with our products. They're very loyal, and so you see this upward trajectory of our Services business. It's not only with the App Store but there's several categories that are growing very well for us. Tim mentioned Apple Music, but we got other parts of the business that continue to do well, even as I said during a period of time when our sales have come down a bit.",1
"Thank you. And then Tim, we've seen an increasing focus on artificial intelligence, both in smartphones like the new Pixel from Google but also in some of the home assistance, like the Amazon Echo. And you guys have obviously had Siri for a while as well. But I just am curious how you think about balancing AI with your focus on privacy. And then also how important it is to have a dedicated home assistant versus just having the phone as the home assistant?",1
"I think to answer your second question first, I think that most people would like an assistant with them all the time. And we live in a mobile society. People are constantly moving from home to work and to other things that they may be doing. And so the advantage of having a assistant on your phone is it's with you all the time. That doesn't say that there is not a nice market for a home one. I'm not making that point. I'm just saying on a balance point of view, I think the usage of one on the phone will likely be much greater.",1
"In fact, you can just look at Siri today and this is now accelerating with iOS 10 and the Mac, but we've been getting 2 billion requests a week for Siri. And so it's very large and to the best of our knowledge, we've shipped more assistant enabled devices than probably anyone out there. Our focus is on this worldwide, and so it's not only a U.S. focus, but we want to deliver a great experience around the world and deliver it globally, and so we've put a lot of the energy into doing that.",1
"Thank you very much. Luca, I wanted ask you about the total deferred revenue which was down about $1.3 billion in June and I think down another $400 million in September. Those are rather large declines, even given the fact that your units are coming down and you had the accounting change back in September. Could you talk about some of the drivers of that and what you might expect going forward?",1
"Okay. Tim, if I could ask you one, please. You've talked in the past about television being an area of intense interest. I was wondering if you could reaffirm that statement. Is that still the case? And then additionally, given what's happening with acquisitions, how broadly you think about the role of content. Apple has started creating on a very limited scale some of its own content and whether you think content creation and ownership is important to Apple, or whether Apple ultimately sees its place in the value chain as being more around the ecosystem and distribution.",1
"Steve, you mentioned by far the largest driver. The largest driver is the fact that we made the change, an accounting change to our ESPs exactly a year ago. So we are lapping the year where you see the effect. I think you're not going to see the same thing going forward. And then we tend to defer some revenue on some other categories, like for example gift cards or some AppleCare, but in general by far the largest element is the change in ESPs. And again, I don't think you're going to see the same impact going forward.",1
"Okay. Thank you. And then, Tim, some investors are antsy that Apple has not acquired new profit pools or introduced a financially material new product in recent years. The question is, A, does Apple today have a grand strategy for what you want to do? I know you won't tell us what it us, but do you know what you want to do over the next three to maybe five years? Or is it more a read the market and quickly react? And B, do you have any sense that we're kind of in a gap period where the technology and arguably what we'd call the next job to be done haven't yet aligned? And so maybe in a couple years, we will see this flurry of new products and it'll sort of match what people want to do, but it's not quite here yet?",1
"We have the strongest pipeline that we've ever had and we're really confident about the things in it. But as usual, we're not going to talk about what's ahead.",1
"But in terms of your approach I guess to new products, do you have a strong sense of where technology is going and where you're going to play? Or is it still enough up the year that you are willing to react fairly quickly, which arguably your organization allows you to do for the size of company you are?",1
We have a strong sense of where things go and we're very agile to shift as we need to.,1
"From Bank of America, Wamsi Mohan.",1
"I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here. In terms of owning content and creating content, we have started with focusing on some original content, as you point out. We've got a few things going there that we've talked about. And I think it's a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. and so it's is an area that we're focused on.",1
"But maybe the most important element of this is the fact that we are supply constrained on 7 and 7 Plus. And so when you talk about other competitors, it's not particularly relevant to us right now because we are selling everything that we can produce. And so when we look at all these things in its totality, we think that for the total company of course, we believe that revenue's going to grow. You know that we don't get into specific product from a unit standpoint giving guidance, and so we feel very confident about the trajectory for the company and for iPhone going forward.",1
"It's hard to say. I believe that on iPhone 7 we will. On iPhone 7 Plus, I'm not sure. I wouldn't say yes at this point, because the underlying demand looks extremely strong on both products but particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus versus our forecast going into the product launch.",1
"Thank you very much. A couple of questions. The first, Tim, can you talk a bit more about China, just how you're thinking about it, where you're seeing pressure? I know you mentioned that you expect to see a significant rebound during the first quarter, but what are your customers telling you about the demand in China?",1
"Thanks. Good afternoon. Luca, can you help us understand what's embedded in revenue guidance for the extra week as well as any rebuilding of channel inventory given all the major products are running below target? Just trying to get at whether you see revenue and in particular iPhone growth year on year on more of a sellout basis when you adjust for those two factors? And then I have a follow up.",1
"Yes Katy, sure. Let me say a few things on the 14th week and revenue up for the December quarter. Keep in mind that December quarter a year ago for us was an all-time quarterly revenue record. We think we can grow this year. As Tim said, the interest from customers on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is very strong. The strength of our Services business, you've seen we've grown 24% in September. We think we can continue to grow very well into the December quarter.",1
"You mentioned the 14th week, and the few extra days do help us this quarter. But I think it's important to keep in mind that there are other factors that go and offset these extra few days. As you know, the launch timing of the new iPhone is different this year. We had the first 90 days of sales this year hit Q4. There were only two days last year, so the cadence has moved more towards the Q4 this year versus Q1 last year. As you know, we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units in the first quarter of 2016. As Tim said, we are very supply constrained on iPhone 7 Plus this year. We're simply more supply constrained this year than we were a year ago.",1
"And then keep in mind that there were a couple of things that affect the compare as well, which is the fact that a year ago, we had an award for a patent infringement of $548 million, which is obviously a one-off item that is not going to repeat this year. And also the foreign exchange environment remains difficult, and we expect FX to be about $650 million headwind on a year-over-year basis into the December quarter. So I hope that gives you a bit of a sense that when you take into account all these factors, we believe that this is a good guidance for the December quarter.",1
"That's great color. Thank you for that. A follow up for Tim. What should we read into the fact that R&D has more than doubled over the past three years while sales growth was sort of a fifth of that? Are R&D investments just less efficient than they were in the company's history, or should we think about that as incremental spend for products that haven't yet come to market?",1
"There's clearly some amount of R&D that are on products that today are in the development phase that have not reached the market, and so that's a part of it. And we feel really great about the things that we've got. We've also put a lot of emphasis on our Services business as well and on making the ecosystem even better. And so we're very much, we're confidently investing in the future, and that's the reason you see the R&D spend increasing.",1
"Yeah, it's a good question, Shannon. So to sort of back up from our results for the quarter, the 90-day clock, and look at the full year of 2016, we were down 17% compared to the fiscal year 2015 which was up 84% from the previous year. So if you look at 2014 to 2016, the revenue grew 52% and the CAGR was 23%, which is really a pretty good result.",1
"Toni, let me take this one. I think you mentioned a number of the things that are affecting us in the December quarter, and I went through them with Katy just a few minutes ago. You're right, we've got an extra few days. You know very well the launch timing is different. You know that we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units a year ago. I mentioned two issues that affect us, the one-timer from a year ago that you obviously need to exclude from the compare and the FX that is the reality of our business right now.",1
"Also as you probably know, the fiscal year 2016 performance was hurt by the devaluation of the currency which affected it about 3%, so the underlying business performance was 14% down. And so, why was it down? There's lots of reasons, but the largest one in our view is that when you look at what happened in 2015 in China, we had a surge of upgraders that came into the market for the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, and the upgrade rate increased relatively more in Greater China than elsewhere around the world. And so when that upgrade rate in fiscal year 2016 returned to a more normal upgrade rate, which would be akin to what we saw with the iPhone 5S as a point, it had further to fall. And so that's the main reason in our view that you see a difference.",1
"Now that spun or created another issue for us, because we didn't forecast that accurately. So in Q1 of last year, we put in too much channel inventory and had been resetting the channel inventory over the few quarters that came beyond it or came after it. And so those two issues, which really the main one is really the first one and the second one was a symptom of it, are in our views the main issue. Now looking forward, the response to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has been very positive. It's very hard to gauge demand, as you know, when you're selling everything you're making. And so we'll find out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough to give you guys guidance that we're returning to growth this quarter, which obviously feels very good for us.",1
"And from a longer-term point of view, out of the 90-day clocks and so forth, we are very bullish on China. We continue to see a middle class that is booming there. There might be some sort of a new normal in the economy, but a new normal there is still a good growth rate. And so with the number of middle class â people growing into the middle class and the LTE adoption rate being still fairly low, around 45%, 50% or so, then I think we continue to have a really good opportunity there, and so we continue to focus significantly in China.",1
"And then can you talk a bit about acquisitions? And I don't mean like the smaller ones that you've done sort of at a normal cadence, but there was clearly a fairly large one announced at least this week in the content world. And especially if you find a way to have repatriation of some of the cash at a low tax rate possibly with the next administration. So I just, if you can give sort of an overall view of how you think about acquisitions that might be a little bit larger than normal.",1
"We are open to acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value where we can deliver better products to our customers and innovate more. And so we look at a whole variety of companies, and based on that, we choose whether to move forward or not. But we're definitely open and we definitely look.",1
"Yes. Thank you. I have a question and a follow-up, please. I guess a cynic could say Apple is benefiting from an extra week this quarter and is benefiting from Samsung being in complete disarray. And yet from your guidance, it's unclear that iPhone unit growth will be up or certainly not up more than low single-digits implied from your guidance. And I appreciate some of the issues around channel inventory build and the timing of the launch, but if I just stand back from that and say you have terrific new products, your major competitor's laying down, you have an enormous, you have a significant contribution from an extra week, arguably 7% or 8%, and yet the iPhone growth is sort of flattish, what does that really say about how investors should think about iPhone on a sustained basis growing forward? And is it reasonable to think that this is an ongoing growing business for the company?",1
"Okay. And then as my follow-up if I could, Tim, you mentioned before on a previous comment on iPad where you saw I think 50% to 70% in the top six countries were new buyers and related to a previous question, wondered if you could give that same range. I understand it's probably a pretty wide range for iPhones and that was to the June quarter I think.",1
And so we're investing like crazy in the market. We're more than doubling our stores. We've got 15 in Greater China today. We're going to be close to 40 in the next couple of years. We've expanded our online store to cover now 315 cities in China. The revenue results for Q4 were up more than double the previous year.,1
"And then finally, in terms of another headwind that is a little less than it was, currency has been affecting us more significantly. Last quarter in China, it affected us 1 percentage point. And so the sum of all that, I feel great about the results. We don't obviously provide geographic-specific guidance but you can see from our overall guidance, we think we're going to have a really strong quarter.",1
"And so when I look at China, I see an enormous market where there are more people graduating into the middle class than any nation on earth in history and just an incredible market where people brought the latest technology and products that we were providing.",1
"Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. Todayâs call is being recorded.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri, and after some final remarks we'll open the call for questions from analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information youâll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future products.",1
"Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Appleâs Form 10-K for 2013, the Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2014, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us. Since we spoke in July, it's been an exciting and very busy time, so we have lots of great things to talk about today.",1
"Just last month, we launched the biggest advancements in iPhone's history with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. These iPhones are the best we have ever created and customers absolutely love them.",1
"Our operational team has done an extraordinary job executing the manufacturing ramp throughout the entire supply chain. Today we've launched in 32 countries including China and our new iPhones will be shifting in 69 countries and territories by the end of this month, making this our fastest and most successful iPhone launch ever.",1
Demand for the new iPhones has been staggering and geographically broad-based markedly higher in every single country where we've launched compared to the iPhone 5s a year ago.,1
We're working hard to fill orders as fast as possible and we're on track to be in more than 115 countries by the end of December.,1
"Last month we introduced two new categories; the first is Apple Pay, an entirely new way to pay for things in stores and in apps. It makes mobile payments easier, more secure and more private. Apple Pay went live today and now making purchases and participating stores happens with just a touch of a finger.",1
Paying within apps is as easy as selecting Apple Pay and placing a finger on Touch ID. Today Apple Pay supports credit and debit cards from the three major payment networks and the top U.S. banks and over 500 additional banks have signed on and will be supporting Apple Pay beginning this year and early next year. Apple Pay is being supported by many of the nation's top retailers and we continue to sign more retailers.,1
"The second new category is Apple Watch, our most personal device ever and one that has already captured the world's imagination. We can't wait to get Apple Watch to customers beginning in early calendar 2015. We'll be providing more details on Apple Watch as we get closer to the shipment day.",1
Last week we launched the new iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 with innovations that make them dramatically better than previous generation and the stunning new iMac with a Retina 5K display.,1
"We released iOS 8 last month and our customers are enjoying new ways to use their iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with intuitive new features and groundbreaking security.",1
"Last week, we also released OS X Yosemite, with an all new design and continuity features that deliver an even more fluid experience across all of our iOS devices and Mac.",1
Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude todayâs presentation. We do thank everyone for your participation.,1

"I think carriers like to sell as many units as they can and get as many people in their service. And in most regions walk into the un-serviced contracts and so they're very predictable and reliable and I don't really see that changing. I think the carriers have come up with some different or some carriers have come up with different sales programs that might appeal to someone who wants to upgrade their phone annually instead of every other year. I think those programs in general probably reduce the subsidy somewhat in the aggregate for people that take these up. But customers may due to such a fair exchange for getting the upgrade more often, so there's a customer proposition for it. Other than that I think we have great relationships with the carriers. I think they were as we were very happy with the iPhone rollout.",1
"I think the way â the number one thing to know on the channel inventory is that our range as you know for iPhone is four to six weeks and we were at the low end of our range. And so that to me is the most â that's the most important thing I look at anyway I should say. You can choose to look at the thing that's most important to you. In terms of a changing from where it's been in the past, the things that you should consider are the â China was in wave one this year, so there was a lot more point-of-sales there. We added DOCOMO in Japan. And so that's a large carrier to add. And what probably were not in the opening comments was that of the 14 million, 1.8 million of those were iPhones that were in transit and therefore not available to sale in the channel. And we always count those in channel inventory because they are in our sales line. And so that's how I look at the iPhone inventory.",1
"Next from UBS, we will go to Steve Milunovich.",1
"Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about the supply side? There has been some thoughts that the fingerprint technology has been a little bit hard to manufacture and you indicated that the Retina mini would be out later in November. So kind of curious, if youâre going to be able to lead the demand for the holidays with the mini that you would like to or may be some general supply comments and also comments on component cost.",1
"Sure. Steve itâs Tim. In terms of supply, iPhone 5s into the quarter with a very significant backlog. We are still -- we still have a significant backlog. However, our supply is building each week and weâre -- weâve been -- and weâre very confident of our ability to keep ramping and so we rolled out 30 more countries with the iPhone 5s and 5c as of last Friday and we'll roll out another 16 this week. And so we're right on where we would like to be in terms of achieving 100 countries by the end of the calendar year. In terms of the retina or the iPad Mini with the retina display, we'll start shipping later in November. It's unclear whether we will have enough for the quarter or not. We now have mini â we will have but you really don't know the demand until after you start shipping and so we'll see how that goes. But I think we'll do fairly well with iPad as I had mentioned before. We felt like it's going to be a really great holiday season. On terms of component cost, both DRAM and NAND were up last quarter from the previous quarter. DRAM we believe will continue to be up in this quarter. We think NAND will be flat and other commodities will fall sequentially.",1
"Okay. And then Peter, about a year ago you indicated that the December quarter would benefit by about 200 basis points in gross margin due to a combination of mix shift toward phones and higher volume. Is that the sort of uplift you would expect from those factories this December quarter?",1
"Steve, I don't want to put a precise amount on it but we â I see us benefiting from a couple of things in the quarter; the leverage on the higher revenue by far being the biggest. As Tim mentioned, we expect to have a positive commodity environment and selling iPhones is never a bad thing from the margin perspective.",1
"Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. The first question for Tim just regarding the channel inventory levels of 14.3 million for the iPhone, much higher than we've seen in the quarters past. Is there similar sort of message there in terms of you not having much broader coverage in terms of incremental coverage or is there a much bigger incremental upgrade cycle from your installed base or both?",1
"Okay. And then just a follow-up, if I could. A year ago you had a very ambitious multi-product ramp in terms of new products coming out. At the same time you did have some impacts related to supply constraints. Just to kind of follow up on Steve's question. Do you feel that four months later, fast forward to the future now that you're in a much better shape to kind of avert or navigate some of these big supply constraints that inflicted some problems on you last year or can we see a similar situation as we move to the quarter?",1
And just lastly I wanted to ask about subsidies. That wasn't mentioned as a potential impact to phone margins but can you comment on carrier subsidies more generally? How sustainable are they given the competitive environment and how are carriers responding to the pricing stack of your phone line? Thanks a lot.,1
"As I mentioned on the iPhone 5s I feel like we're doing really well on supply. The demand is very robust. And so we are in backlog right now. But I feel confident about us continuing to ramp and do quite well for the quarter. On the iPad Mini we'll start shipping later this month and it's very difficult to forecast exactly when supply and demand will balance there. We'll also see about the iPad Air as we go out this week. I think we'll have a really good weekend. It may be that not everyone can find what they want more [ph]. I think versus last year I think one key difference is we announced one of our key Macs, the iMac but we didn't begin shipping until the end of December. And so we went for more than two months with minimal iMac sales and therefore from a Mac point of view year-over-year last year, we had â our only down a quarter, down versus the market that is in the last 30 quarters. And so I don't envision that happening this year. I feel really good about the way the MacBook Pros have gotten off last week. They've gotten off to a huge start. I feel great about Mac growing year-over-year this quarter. I feel great about iPad growing year-over-year this quarter as well. You can tell that from the strong guidance numbers that Peter gave earlier.",1
"Thank you, Mark. Can we have the next question please?",1
Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about iPhone ASPs. They were down about 7% year-on-year in the quarter and down sequentially. Last year they were up sequentially on the launch. Was that a product supply availability issue? And how do you think about ASPs going forward?,1
"Chris, it's Peter. Sequentially we were relatively flat, so I'll comment on a year-over-year basis. They were down 7% as you indicated and this was primarily due to a significant increase in the sales of our entry SKUs where we had made them more affordable to attract more first-time smart buyers. We've also encouraged some FX headwinds from the yen, the Australian dollar and a number of the emerging markets which impacted us as well. I don't want to forecast ASPs for the December quarter. We'll report to you in January what they were. But the FX headwinds will likely continue given where exchange rates are today.",1
"And just to follow-up on Mark's earlier question around channel inventories, that 14 million unit number was I think higher than a lot of people expected. Was that also SKU-ed [ph] towards the low end of the product stack given the 5s was short exiting the quarter?",1
"The 5s was in huge backlog and so any kind of 5s that was in the channel was a transitionary kind of move â maybe perhaps in transit and so forth. We did have as I mentioned before, we had 1.8 million units of total iPhone units in transit at the end of the quarter. So that's a pretty substantial number.",1
"These introductions reflect years of innovation and hard work by teams all across Apple and they demonstrate the seamless integration of hardware, software and services that provides unparallel user experiences for our customers. These are things that only Apple can do.",1
We've also communicated and demonstrated our commitment to respecting and protecting users' privacy with strong encryption and strict policies that govern how our data is handled.,1
Today we're also reporting very strong results for Apple's fourth fiscal quarter. We generated our strongest revenue growth rate in seven quarters far surpassing our expectations we communicated in July and establishing a new record for Apple's September quarter revenue.,1
"Also, In August ChangeWave survey of U.S. corporate IT buyers found that among those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter 75% plan to purchase iPhones. An iPhone continues to fuel innovation of companies around the world.",1
"Gross margin was 38% at the high end of the guidance range, operating margin was $11.2 billion representing 26.5% of revenue. Net income was $8.5 billion, a new September quarter record translating to diluted earnings per share of $1.42, a 20% year-over-year increase. Cash flow from operations was very strong, a $13.3 billion, also a new Q4 record.",1
"For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 39.3 million iPhones, an increase of 5.5 million over last year or 16% growth. Underlying demand was even stronger with sell-through growth of 26%.",1
"iPhone sales grew across both developed and emerging markets. Unit sales in the U.S. grew 17% year-over-year, and in Western Europe they were up 20%. We saw even stronger growth in Latin America and the Middle East with sales up more than 50% and in Central and Eastern Europe where sales more than doubled.",1
"We increased iPhone channel inventory by just under one million units during the September quarter this year, significantly less than the 3.3 million unit increase in the September quarter a year ago.",1
"Based on the very strong demand for our new iPhones, this left us below our target range of four to six weeks for channel inventory on a look forward basis.",1
iPhone momentum in enterprise market remains very strong. The latest data published by IDC indicates that iPhone have 69% share of the U.S. commercial smartphone market.,1
"Schindler, a leading global escalator and elevator manufacturer has deployed over 20,000 iPhones and 20 customer apps to improve customer engagements for safety and to allow service technicians to access vital documentation, repair and safety functions when they are in the field.",1
"With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our September quarter results in more detail.",1
"Baidu, China's top search provider currently has over 20,000 employees using iPhones and the company has developed over 30 in-house iOS apps to help its employees work more efficiently, track sales leads and manage internal IT infrastructure and processes.",1
"Next, I would like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.5 million Macs, an increase of almost a million over last year. That represents 21% growth year-over-year and an all-time quarterly record. We saw great demand in the back-to-school season for both desktops and portables with especially strong growth for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.",1
"We achieved double-digit Mac growth across most markets around the world, with particularly impressive performance in emerging markets where Mac sales were up 46%.",1
These results are truly remarkable given the contraction in the global PC market and we now gain market share for 33 of the last 34 quarters. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our four to five week target range.,1
"Turning to iPad, we sold 12.3 million units compared to 14.1 million in the September quarter last year. In anticipation of our October new product announcement we reduced iPad channel inventory by 500,000 from the end of the June quarter, which left us within our target range of channel inventory on a look-back basis.",1
"iPad sales were consistent with our expectations and we experienced very strong results in Japan where iPad sales were up 46% year-over-year. Customers continue to love their iPads. In an August survey by ChangeWave iPad Mini with retina display earned an incredible 100% satisfaction rate, and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, the survey indicated a 55% plan to buy an iPad.",1
"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the September quarter we generated record revenue of $42.1 billion, an increase $4.7 billion or 12% year-over-year. These results exceeded our guidance range due to better than expected sales of iPhones and Macs for which customer demand grew strongly year-over-year in all our segments.",1
"I'd like to thank all of our customers, employees, developers and business partners for making fiscal 2014 Apple's best year yet and I'd like to thank all of our shareholders for their continued support. I could not be more excited about the road ahead in fiscal 2015.",1
"We're also reporting gross margin of 38% compared to 37% last year, leading to a very strong EPS growth of 20%. Fueled by the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and strong demand for our previous iPhone models, we set a new September quarter record for iPhone with revenue growth of 21% year-over-year.",1
We made big investments in our business and have continued to expand our global footprint. Today we have 437 Apple retail stores in 15 countries and our partners are selling Apple products in hundreds of thousands of locations around the world.,1
Demand for iPhone was strong across all geographies with global unit sell-through growth of 26% and we exited the quarter with significant backlog for both iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.,1
"We established an all-time quarterly record for Mac sales with revenue growing 18% year-over-year, thanks in particular to the very strong performance of our portables.",1
We're especially proud of our Mac results considering the overall contraction of the global PC market this year and we achieved our highest quarterly market share since 1995.,1
"We also set an all-time record for the App Store revenue, thanks to the tremendous momentum and ongoing success of our developer community. App Store revenue grew 36% over last year and cumulative app downloads have now topped 85 billion.",1
"These results bring to a close a record breaking fiscal 2014. Over the last four quarters, our products and services have generated a $183 billion in revenues, an increase of $12 billion over last year. We sold 243 million iOS devices and 19 million Macs, both all-time highs.",1
"Our revenue from iTunes software and services reached $18 billion, which was more than the annual sales of two thirds of the companies in the Fortune 500 and we generated $6.45 in earnings per share, which is 14% higher than last year and also set a new record.",1
"We're continuing to invest in developing markets where revenues approached $50 million in fiscal year '14, up 16% over last year and twice the rate of growth of the company overall.",1
"In addition to Apple's strong business performance over the past four quarters, I am incredibly proud of all of our work to protect the environment, to advance human rights, to improve working conditions in the supply chain and to change the way teachers teach and students learn.",1
We [forged] (ph) a landmark partnership with IBM to provide a new generation of mobile enterprise application designed with our products legendary ease of use and backed by IBM's cloud services and data analytics.,1
"Our partnership aims to redefine the way work is done, address key industry mobility challenges and sparked true mobile-led business change.",1
"Developer teams have been working closely to develop the first wave of Mobile First solutions and these solutions will be ready for customers beginning next month across six sectors; banking, government, insurance, retail, travel and transportation and telecommunication.",1
We brought tremendous new talent and technology into Apple through 20 acquisitions in fiscal '14 including seven alone in the September quarter. We closed the Beats transition in July and we're off to a great start with some wonderful plans we'll share with you in the future.,1
"Our strong results continue to generate significant cash and we're extremely happy that this has enabled us to make substantial investments in Apple's future, while retaining -- while returning cash to our shareholders.",1
"We had executed aggressively against our share repurchase program, spending $17 billion in the September quarter alone and $45 billion in the last year.",1
"Thank you, Shannon. The next question please.",1
"Itâs a good question. We had our best education quarter ever. We went over a $1 billion in revenues for the first time ever. We were up strongly year-over-year up 8%. iPad was up 22% year-over-year and the Mac was up 8% and as you know the PC market was down 10% in the aggregate and likely down even more in education. And so we feel like weâre doing great on both fronts, both in the iPad space and in the Mac space for people wanting to buy Mac. And we do see Chromebookâs in some places, but the vast majority of people are buying PC/Mac or an iPad. Our share of tablet in education is 94%. I mean itâs -- yeah, itâs sort of unheard of. I have never seen a market share that high before. So we feel like we are doing really well here and are great to be making -- feel great to be making a contribution to education.",1
"Great. And then -- I just had a question on education which somewhat ties into this since iWork and iLife I think are some of these operating systems run through that, Iâm curious with the -- what your thoughts are with regard to Chromebook Google apps, any kind of foothold that we are seeing with Google taking share in education because as weâve seen some of the price points for the devices are pretty low, but clearly you guys are able to sell into education as well. So Iâm kind of curious as to how you view the competition and how you position your products vis-Ã -vis some of the things that are fairly low priced?",1
"Cumulative app downloads have reached 60 billion and our app developers have now earned 13 billion from sales to the App Store, half of which they've earned in the last year. We had a tremendously successful launch of iOS 7 last month with hundreds of millions of downloads in the first few days alone, making it the fastest software upgrade ever. Last week we reported nearly two-thirds of iOS devices were already running iOS 7; that's significantly higher than the percentage of users running the latest versions of other mobile operating systems. This rapid transition to the latest version of iOS not only means that more customers are having the most advanced experience possible but it also enables developers to offer their latest app innovations to hundreds of billions of users in a single software release.",1
"Schools around the world continue to adopt iPad to transform teaching and learning in the classroom. In the U.K. the number of iPads sold to K-12 schools has more than doubled year-over-year and in Latin America; over 70,000 iPads are being used by systemic learner students [ph] across 800 schools to improve their learning experience.",1
"Here in the U.S., school districts continue to rollout large iPad initiatives to students. The Coachella Valley School District in California is currently distributing over 19,000 iPads to its entire student body. In South Carolina every one of the Horry County School District's 10,000 middle school students will receive an iPad this year. These broad deployments are in part driven by the great educational content available on iPad and we're pleased to report that iBooks textbooks are now available across the U.S., U.K. and Australian national high school curricula.",1
"Last week we were thrilled to introduce new iPads featuring the A7 chip with 64-bit desktop-class architecture, ultrafast wireless and expanded LTE connectivity. The new iPad Air features a beautiful retina display in an elegant unit body design that is 20% thinner and 28% lighter than the fourth generation iPad and the iPad Mini with retina display packs all the pixels of the iPad Air into its stunning 7.9 inch display and runs over 475,000 iPad apps available in the app store.",1
"Turning to Mac, sales with 4.6 million Macs were above our expectations, which is a 7% decline from the year-ago quarter. IDC estimates that the global personal computer market contracted by 10% during the September quarter indicating that Macs continues to gain share just as they have with 29 of the last 30 quarters. We were especially pleased with strong year-over-year growth in sales of MacBook Air which we updated in June. In late September we updated iMac with fourth generation Intel quad-core processors, new graphics, next generation Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage options.",1
"Last week we launched new versions of MacBook Pro with retina display featuring fourth generation Intel core processors, faster graphics, long rate battery life and a more affordable price. Also last week we launched Mavericks, the 10th major release of OS X with more than 200 new features. Mavericks brings iBooks and Maps to the Mac, includes the new version Safari, enhances multi-display support, introduces Finder Tabs and Tags and delivers core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and performance and is now free. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory that was just below our four to five week target range.",1
"We continue to be very pleased with the growth of iTunes software and services in the strength of the Apple ecosystem. Our iTunes Stores generated record billings of $4.4 billion in the September quarter thanks to continued strong growth in sales of apps. The quarter's iTunes billings translated quarterly iTunes revenue $2.4 billion, up 15% from the year-ago quarter. The strong iTunes sales combined with other software and service revenue resulted in total quarterly revenue 4.3 billion from iTunes software and services, an increase of 22% year-over-year.",1
"iOS offers something now for everyone with its great new design and features such as control center, AirDrop and iTunes Radio. In fact the number of unique listeners who have tried iTunes Radio is now 20 million and growing. iOS 7 also includes significant features that make iPhones and iPads more secure in users to manage in corporate environments, offering new ways to configure and deploy devices at scale.",1
"In its latest Mobility Index Report, Good Technology indicated that the iOS platform accounted for 95% of enterprise mobile app activations and 72% of all mobile device activations in the September quarter while iPad accounted for 90% of total tablet activations. Companies around the world are using iPads with custom apps to reinvent their legacy business processes; improving efficiencies across organizations and job sections.",1
"New device management capabilities include control sharing of documents and attachments, App Store license management, wireless managed app setup and streamline mobile device management and enrollment. In terms of security, iOS 7 offers enterprise single sign-on, default third party app data protection and per app VPNs automatically connect stored corporate apps to the network without the need for users to change complicated settings.",1
"I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. The revenue for the quarter was 4.5 billion, up 6% from the year-ago quarter. The stores produced very strong iPhone sales with unit growth of 36% per store per week compared to the September quarter last year. W completed the remodels of two stores and opened eight new stores during the quarter ending with a total of 416 stores including 162 outside the United States. We are projecting a total of approximately 30 new store openings in fiscal year '14, about two-thirds of which will be outside U.S.",1
"We also plan to remodel about 20 stores over the course of fiscal year '14. With an average of 411 stores opened in the September quarter, average revenue per store was 10.9 million compared to 11.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment income was 709 million. We hosted 99 million visitors to stores during the quarter which translates to 18,500 visitors per store per week. Operating expenses were 3.8 billion and included 467 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was 113 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 25.9%.",1
"Turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with 146.8 billion in cash plus short term and long term marketable securities, a sequential increase of $100 million from the June quarter. Our domestic cash was 35.5 billion at the end of the September quarter, a sequential decline of 5.2 billion largely attributable to our share repurchase activity. $111.3 billion or 76% of our total cash was offshore at the end of the September quarter, and cash flow from operations was $9.9 billion.",1
We paid $2.8 billion in dividends in the quarter and we executed an additional $5 billion in repurchases up 10.4 million shares of Apple stock during the quarter. This brings us to a cumulative total of $36 billion in payments for dividends and share repurchases over the last five quarters of which share buybacks were $23 billion. This has resulted in cumulative retirement of almost 47 million shares and represents 5% of the total shares outstanding prior to the launch of our repurchase program. More than 44 million of these shares have been retired in the past two quarters alone.,1
"Finally given that our capital return program must be funded from domestic cash, and as a result of our payments to date, the cash that we can net domestically and return to shareholders to stop accumulating. In fact we give return to shareholders who invested essentially all of the increase in available net cash generated since the beginning of our capital return program in 2012. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 for common share payable on November 14, 2013 to shareholders of record as in the close of this on November 11, 2013.",1
"For example, direct store delivery reps at Dr Pepper Snapple Group uses iPads to facilitate communications and streamline the product delivery process. East Japan Railway personnel use iPad Minis to stay informed about schedule changes and access conductor manual. And Swedish manufacturer SKS uses a custom iPad app to calculate the life of their ball bearing products saving 10 to 15 minutes per calculation for every engineer several times per day.",1
"Interest in iPad remains incredibly strong. In an August survey by ChangeWave, consumers who intend to purchase tablets within 90 days, 55% indicated they find the purchase of iPads more than four times the rate of the next most popular alternative. And of those who already own iPads, the survey measured a 99% customer satisfaction rate. The momentum of iOS devices in enterprise also remains incredibly strong.",1
"So, iLife and iWork has become as essential for the user experience as mail, messages and calendar. So weâre now making iPhoto, iMovie, Pages, Numbers and Keynotes available as free downloads to customers who purchase new iOS devices and weâre also making Mavericks and future OS X upgrades as well as iLife and iWork free to our Mac customers. As a result of the traditional rights and features we are deferring a greater portion of the sale of each iOS device in Mac sold. We anticipate that the additional deferral per device sold coupled with our sequentially greater unit volume expectations in the December quarter will result in about a $900 million sequential increase in the net amount of revenue deferred for software upgrade rights and non-software services.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $37.5 billion, up $1.5 billion or 4% from the year-ago quarter, and slightly above the high end of the guidance range. Gross margin was 37% at the high end of our guidance range, and operating margin was $10 billion, representing 26.8% of revenue. Net income was $7.5 billion translating to diluted earnings per share of $8.26.",1
"The smartphone category is expected to grow significantly in the next few years from about 1 billion units per year this year to over 1.7 billion in 2017. And the tablet market is growing at an even faster way from about 225 billion units this year to over 400 million in 2017. We are continuing to invest in R&D and distribution, weâre expanding our geographic coverage and weâre building upon a phenomenal, but still very young retail store presence.",1
"We are also proud to be a force for good in the world beyond our products, whether its improving working conditions of the environment, standing up for human rights, helping eliminate AIDS or reinventing education, Apple is making substantial contributions to society.",1
I would like to thank all of our customers and our long-term shareholders for their loyalty and Iâd also like to thank Appleâs many talented employees who have worked tirelessly to bring us this far and who are passionately focused on making great products that enrich peopleâs lives.,1
Iâd now turn the call over to Peter to discuss the details of the most recent quarter. Peter?,1
"Thank you, Tim.",1
"We are pleased to report the results of the final quarter of Appleâs fiscal year â13 with record four quarter iPhone sales, driving our highest September quarter revenue ever.",1
"As for the details of the quarter, I would like to begin with iPhone. We sold 33.8 million iPhones compared to 26.9 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 6.9 million or 26% and a new September quarter record. iPhone sales were ahead of our expectations and grew stronger year-over-year in each of our geographic segments.",1
"Turning to iPad, we sold 14.1 million iPads during the quarter compared to 14 million in the year-ago quarter. iPad sales exceeded our expectations in the September quarter as we approach our new product introductions. We experienced robust year-over-year sales growth in Japan, Russia, the Middle East and we were pleased with strong back-to-school demand for iPad in the U.S. and Canada. iPad sell-through was roughly equal to sell-in, so we exited the quarter with about 4.1 million units of iPad channel inventory within our target range of four to six weeks on a look-back basis.",1
"We were particularly pleased with growth in a number of developing markets with unit sales up sharply year-over-year in Latin America, the Middle East, Russia and India. We were also very happy to add NTT Docomo to our carrier line up in Japan, a country where demand to iPhone has been especially strong.",1
"iPhone sales remain very robust in the U.S with comScore estimating that Apple was the leading smartphone manufacture with a 40.7% smartphone subscribership for the three months ending in August. And among North American customers polled by ChangeWave late last month, we plan to purchase the smartphone with a 90 days, 63% indicated they plan to purchase an iPhone.",1
"We exited the quarter with about 14.3 million total iPhones in channel inventory, which represented a sequential increase of 3.3 million from the June quarter and placed us at the low end of our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look forward basis.",1
"Customers are loving their iPhones. Based on the most recently published research, ChangeWave measured a 96% customer satisfaction rate among iPhone users and Kantar measured a 92% customer loyalty rate, significantly higher than the competition. And we believe that a great customer experience translates to much higher usage. In fact, Experian reported that iPhone users spend an average of 53% more time each day on their phone than android phone users.",1
"iPhone continues to be a key productivity tool for organizations around the world aided by apps from the app store as well as those custom built for internal use. In fact, nearly 35,000 companies representing millions of employees worldwide are building custom apps that address specific workflow improvements with their iPhones and iPad users.",1
"In the U.S., over 14,000 employees of Johnson Controls are using iPhones for work. The company has created in-house apps that have enhanced field technician service delivery and customer communications. In China, AVIC International, a unit of Aviation Industry Corporation of China has equipped 27,000 employees with iPhones to access internally developed apps for office, administrative documentation, approval processes in key business intelligent systems.",1
"Now, as we move ahead into the December quarter, I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to in the beginning of the call. First, I was to explain a bit about revenue deferrals. We believe that our software and services play a tremendous role in delivering an overall experience that our customers have come to know and love. Over the last few years we have added significantly to the offering that we provide our customers a no incremental charge from operating system upgrade rights to non-software services such as Siri and iCloud.",1
In total we expect revenue to be between $55 billion and $58 billion compared to $54.5 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margins to be between 36.5% and 37.5% reflecting approximately a $105 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion including about $585 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.25%.,1
"Our primary reason for doing it Shannon was that we wanted it to become a part of what it meant to own a Mac and what it meant to own an iOS device. We saw iWork had become the best selling productivity app on a mobile device. We wanted all of our customers to have access to our very latest software, so they would have access to our best features. And so we decided to make the bold move of making it free and I know some other folks charge a $199 or so for each of these actually for the OS and the productivity apps. But we really wanted to make it a part of the experience and so we are making it free and we are going back all the way to Snow Leopard on the OS side and iWork is free for all new Macs and so I think itâs a very strong offer, I think itâs just another reason that everyone should buy Mac and we think it was great decision to do so, but most importantly we think itâs great for customers.",1
"Hey, good afternoon and just to make sure this is crystal clear here on the gross margin. It would have been about 38.5% would have been the mid point of the guide excluding the change to deferral, is that correct Peter?",1
Okay. And I guess nothing to announce more but my second question is for Peter. There's some confusion around the revenue deferral and I was just hoping you could clarify it for gross margins. The $900 million is about â I don't know I guess 160 basis points if I have that right on gross margins. How much of that should we say is pressuring gross margin down in your guidance? I mean do we take about â would your gross margin guidance had been about half the difference there higher if it weren't for this revenue deferral? And then when do we recoup that margin? How many quarters does it take to recoup and how will that flow back to the model? Thanks.,1
"Sure, Ben. We have been defying revenues for the sale of each iOS device and Mac given that we have been providing updates to software. Given the announcements that we made last week and that I went through it in my prepared remarks, we have actually increased those deferrals. iPhone and iPad, we are differing between $15 and $25. That's up as much as $5 per device and Mac has been some $20 to $40, so up an additional $20. On a sequential basis, given the increased deferral rates that we have as a result of increase in the software that we are providing to customers for free coupled with our sequential unit increases, we will defer we think about $900 million more in revenue in the December quarter than we deferred in the September quarter. So you can calculate the impact to gross margin on that. We will also and that goes straight through the margin, its revenue and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in gross margin. We will then record that revenue that weâve deferred for iOS devices across a two year period of time ratably and for Max over a four year period of time. So, Ben just to summarize, we happen to frame revenue on both iOS devices and Max for a number of years given the software that we have been giving away for free. We have increased those rates beginning in September for the iOS devices and in October for the Max, and it will come back into those products over two and four years as I said.",1
"Great, thanks. Thatâs a pretty good guide for gross margin if you take that out -- if youâre leaving that out. Thanks.",1
"Ben, Iâd just add on to that, thank you for saying it and I agree; and I would also say that weâre really happy to be guiding gross margin flat not only because of the deferral but in addition to all of the new products that weâve introduced with higher cost structures and lower prices and weâll -- no hard and fast commitments, but weâre going to work really hard to get down the cost curves as we have successfully in the past.",1
Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.,1
"From Piper Jaffray, weâll go to Gene Munster.",1
"Probably in that range, Gene. I didnât do it precisely, but you can take the $900 million that weâre deferring across the revenue range as we did the math.",1
"Hi. Thanks a lot. First question is on China. Tim, congrats on being I think the only company in my sector that grew in China this quarter. I'd have to check that but got to be one of them. You returned to growth I believe at 6%, if my math is right. What happened and do you see that growth rate accelerating? We're hoping you have new partnerships there and how can you expand distribution?",1
"Okay, great. And then beyond the December quarter in terms of structural elements around the iPhone gross margin, a couple of years ago with the 4s we saw the launch and then we saw the margins ramp kind of nicely after the launch. I know youâre not giving guidance beyond the December quarter, but are there some structural things that have changed the profitability of the iPhone it would be good to know as we think about our models in 2014.",1
"I donât know if thereâs any structural differenceâs, but Iâll make a couple of comments and Iâm not giving guidance beyond the December quarter but just a couple of things to think about. Weâre benefiting this quarter as I talked about in answering Katyâs question from the benefits of leverage given the very big sequential increase in revenue. Leverage cut both ways, so presumably that would go against us in the March quarter. However we would expect to defer less for the software deferrals in the March quarter as well. And as I noted at the end of Benâs question, we will endeavor to work very hard to get down cost curves as we have in the past, no change.",1
"Okay. And then my follow-up question, in terms of the iPad and the Mini price change I guess just broader thinking around the iPad weâve seen some fluctuations in the growth rate. How do you think about that segment in terms of growing at or above or below market growth rates around tablets? And separately is there any differences in terms of how often people are upgrading their iPadâs versus the iPhoneâs, it feels like theyâre upgrading them every three years versus a little bit over every two years for the iPhone, is that accurate. So, the size of the opportunity and then maybe just any sort of nuances and the upgrade behaviors between the iPhone and the iPad.",1
"Gene, its Tim. We continue to view the tablet market as huge. We see it as a large opportunity for us. We are not solely focused on unit share as Iâve said many times, but weâre focused on usage in customerâs side, the loyalty and other things that are very important to us. We do believe that this has been or the announcement last week was our largest iPad announcement ever and weâre confident weâre going to grow year-over-year, and if you look back we had a very, very strong quarter a year ago. We get off to a great start this weekend with iPad Air. And then later in the months weâll begin shipping the new Mini. We do feel that we wanted to reduce the price of the iPad Mini and so we did that and now weâre coming in at $299 which is an incredible value to get access to the whole of the ecosystem and so forth. And iPad Air is just, it's absolutely incredible product, the best iPad we have ever done. And so, I think all of these are â [ph] thus these products are going to do really well. I think itâs going to be an iPad Christmas and -- but we will see, we will report the numbers back to you in January how we did, but we are pretty confident.",1
"From Cross Research, we will go to Shannon Cross.",1
"Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit more about your decision to offer the Mac OS for free and provide iWork and iLife with new device purchases? How are you thinking about it vis-Ã -vis some of the competition?",1
"Yes. Ben we had a pretty good quarter in China. We obviously want to do better. But if you look at the quarter, we did grow by 6%. Underneath that, iPhone units were up 25% year-over-year despite significant constraints on iPhone 5s that affected the whole company [ph]. However, we were able to launch in our first round this time in China and that was a big change in the result of a close work relationship with the carriers in China and the government. And so we feel really good about that. We are able to do that on the iPad as well as we announced last week. For the full year, the Greater China region generated over $27 billion in sales for us, up 14% year-over-year. So we have a reasonable sized business there. In the year-ago quarter, iPad launched. It launched late in China and so that pressure, the 6% down some otherwise it would have been I think even a stronger quarter given the strength of iPhone. So we are continuing to invest in stores. We opened one additional store in Greater China in the last few weeks. We're investing in indirect distribution. Our point-of-sales are up by about 50% year-over-year on the iPhone and we're continuing to go out to more cities. Initially we were very focused on just the large cities and so we're working on both coverage on launching earlier and execution and continuing to build on our retail practice there.",1
We'll hear from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.,1
"In closing, we are very pleased with the results of the final quarter of our fiscal year â13. We enter fiscal year â14 with an incredible lineup of products including our amazing new iPhones and iPads. We remain committed to delivering great innovative products and services that delight our customers and enhance their lives, and weâre very confident in our new product pipelines.",1
"Bill, its Tim. If you look at what weâve done with our iPhone line, weâre selling the iPhone 4s as our entry offer. Weâre selling the iPhone 5c as sort of a mid-tier offer and then of course the iPhone 5s. And our goal is to overall have growth worth for total iPhone, but also within that we want to have each of those categories grow as compared to the -- what we were doing previously. And so, if you take look at the total offers that weâre making and low-end space and mid-tier and high-end, the sum of all the price points we offer there weâd like to grow in each one of those and weâre really pleased that we did that, and so thatâs how we measure partly measure success, because the most important thing for us is to make a great product, but we do need growth and weâre happy that weâve seen that. I realize that some people were reading rumors about that the entry phone would be the 5c, but that was never our intent obviously. Our entry iPhone is the iPhone 4s and as you know from comments that Iâve made previously we were selling the iPhone 4 in very good volumes and as we began to experiment in different regions at somewhat lower price points we saw a fair amount of price elasticity and so weâre hoping and thinking that, that will continue with the 4s.",1
(Operator Instructions) First weâll go to Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.,1
"Thanks. Peter, Iâm a little surprised your December quarter gross margin guidance isnât even better given the increased total iPhone mix and also iPhone 5s within the iPhone line. I imagine thereâs a lot of offsetting factors given the products that were launched last week. So, I just wonder if you can walk through some of the gross margin headwinds that you see in the December quarter.",1
"Sure. We expect, as I said in my prepared remarks our gross margins to be between 36.5% and 37.5%. So, essentially inline with the September quarter weâre pleased to be guiding gross margin about flat sequentially given all the new products that we have launched in the last few weeks. During the quarter we expect gross margin to benefit from the leverage on the substantial sequential increase in revenue. Offsetting these benefits we see a few factors including the higher deferred revenue relating to the software that I talked about in my prepared remarks. And as I said we expect the sequential increase in our deferral which is not only revenue but affects margin as well to be $900 million. Second, a richer mix of new iPadâs with higher cost structures and lower pricing. Third, FX headwinds primarily from the Yen and fourth, the new lower priced MacBook Pro and iMac which have higher cost structures and credit structures. So those are four things that I would point out Katy.",1
"Okay, very helpful. Tim, the press and even some of your competitors are quite complementary of the innovation in iPhone 5s. But it seems like investors are looking or glancing over the 64-bit ARM processor, the fingerprint sensor, the M7 processor and part of this is that theyâre not exactly sure what those technologies enable, i.e. why do you need a 64-bit ARM processor in a phone. So, just hoping you could enlighten us a little bit on that question.",1
"Well, I think everything that you mentioned Katy is the front end of a long road map and so we have the first 64-bit smarphone as you mentioned and this is our first use of the fingerprint sensor and if youâve used it thus far you know that it's pretty profound to -- use it from a security point of view and use it also to purchase apps or music or movies et cetera. And so, both of these I think are the most important person here obviously is what our customers think and these new innovations on the 5s and the 5c combined led us to have our best iPhone launch ever with selling about nine million units through the weekend. So it was -- weâre off to a great start.",1
"Okay, great, thanks. Looking at the iPhone business as well, for the 5c there was some anticipation that the price point would be lower and there was obviously some debate around that when you launched it. Now that you had the device out there for a while, a few weeks; what type of response are you seeing from the most cost sensitive regions and can you remind us of some of the things you are doing to make the products increasingly affordable for the emerging regions in particular?",1
"Okay. And then related to that somewhat looking at the iPhone ASPâs overall, last quarter you reminded us that the iPhone ASP and mix tends to be at its highest levels in the first few months of a product cycle and then tends to trend downward throughout the product cycle. Do you think we should assume similar patterns hold for this cycle or there is some unique factors we should consider particularly given the change in the product line?",1
"Thank you, Tony. Can we have the next question please?",1
All things being equal what we would normally see on our products is that you have a large number of people that are early adopter related that come into the market right after we announced and buy our very best product. So other things being equal that's what we would expect to see.,1
"Next, we'll go to Tony Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.",1
"Yes. Thank you. Tim, you commented in your initial remarks about new product categories. I think this was also something you were explicit about in your April quarterly conference call where you said that consumers and investors should expect new products, including new product categories in the second half of this year and first half of 2014. So can you reiterate that we should have that expectation? And when you talk about new product categories, I presume that since you made the statement in April, there have been none? I just want to make sure I understand the semantics of what you referred to as a new category?",1
"Tony, I didn't say in April that you would see them in this year and the first half of next year just to be clear on that. But what I have said is â I have said that you would see some exciting new products from us in the fall of this year and across 2014. And I obviously stand by that and you've seen a lot of things over the last couple of months. In terms of new product categories, specifically if you look at the skills that Apple has from hardware, software and services and at incredible app ecosystems, these set of things are very, very unique. I think no one has a set of skills like us and we obviously believe that we can use our skills in building other great products that are in categories that represent areas where we do not participate today. So we're pretty confident about that.",1
"Okay. As a follow-up I wanted to revisit the question your pricing strategy. Last quarter you spoke very buoyantly about elasticity that you experienced on the iPhone 4 and you had lowered the price in many emerging markets to about $400. Yet when the new products came out, the 4s was actually at a notably higher price than the 4 had been the previous quarter. The 5c was obviously in line with what we had seen before with the 4s and 5s was in line with the 5. So if anything one of the common themes that came out on last earnings call was the desire to embrace the elasticity of the iPhone, but as best I can tell price points across the board seem to be a little bit higher than they were three months ago despite the significant success you had there. So I'm wondering how we should think about what lessons you learned from the 4 pricing changes, why you didn't choose to keep the 4 given that it was an extraordinary strong seller as best we could tell last quarter and how you proceed â how you expect to try and continue to address the lower priced segments of the smartphone market?",1
"Tony, the 400 number just to clarify your number not mine, what we did with our lineup this time was the 4s is replacing the 4 and so if you look at the U.S. as an example, the 4s is now 3, the 4 previously was 3. When you translate that out of the U.S., it depends on the market as to what specifically is happening. As you know currency changes and the strength of the dollar doesn't play in our favor in some geos from that perspective. But generally we see the 4s as our entry iPhone offer that gives somebody the ability to access the entire ecosystem with a fantastic product. And we clearly understand that there is elasticity in that market and we'll move accordingly.",1
"We continue to see some momentum in enterprise for iPad. Progressive IT organizations around the world continue to deploy, manage and develop amazing in-house apps for iPad.",1
"Healthcare leader Sanofi has over 25,000 iPads and over 450 in-house apps for sales teams and corporate employees to get their products and information into the hands of doctors and other healthcare providers.",1
"Premium eyewear designer Luxottica has deployed over 10,000 iPads to improve how customers experience the size, fit and overall look of eyewear in a retail environment. Importantly, since the announcement of the partnership with IBM hundreds of corporations around the world have expressed interest in MobileFirst solutions and we are actively working with over 50 of them to become foundational client for MobileFirst solutions in their industries.",1
"And the range goes from 50 to over 70. And so when I look at number, our first time buyer rates in that area, it is saturated, that's not a saturated market. You never have first time buyer rates at 50% and 70%. What you do see is that people hold on to iPad longer than they do a phone.",1
And so that feels fantastic being up 21% in that market that's shrinking it just -- it doesnât get better than that.,1
"For iPad, if I take a step back on iPad, and I know that there is a lot of negative commentary in the market on this, but I have a little different perspective on it. Here's sort of my simple perspective.",1
"If you look at, instead of looking at this thing each 90 days, if you back up and look at it, we've sold 237 million in just over four years. That's about twice the number of iPhones that we sold over the first four years of iPhone.",1
"If you look at the last 12 months of iPad, we sold 68 million in '13, in fiscal year '13 we sold 71 million. So we were down, but we were down 4% on sell in and the sell-through was a bit better than the negative 4 because we took down channel inventories. And so, to me I view it as a speed bob, not a huge issue.",1
"That's said, we want to grow. We donât like negative numbers on these things and so, looking further in the data, I know that there is a popular view that the market is saturated, but we donât see that. I can't speak to other people but I do look at our data deeply.",1
"And in the last market research data we have is in the June quarter, and let me give you some of this -- the real data that we've got. is that if you look at our top six revenue countries, in the country thatâs sold the lowest percentage of iPads to people who had never bought an iPad before that number is 50%.",1
"And because we've only been in this business four years, we donât really know what the upgrade cycle will be for people. And so that's a difficult thing to call.",1
"Let me comment on both the Mac and the iPad. On the Mac it was just absolutely blow-away order. Our best ever, it will result in our highest market share since 1995. It's just absolutely stunning.",1
"What we do know is that people always respond for us doing great products and we feel really great about what we introduced last week. We also know that the deeper the Apps go in the enterprise, the more it opens up avenues in enterprise and that's a key part of the IBM partnership and what I think customers will get out of that, which is more important than our selling is changing the right people who work.",1
"And so I see catalyst going forward. There are obvious cannibalization; things that are occurring. I'm sure that some people looked at the Mac and iPad and decided on a Mac. I donât have research to demonstrate that, but I am sure that will be just looking at the numbers and I am fine with that by the way.",1
"I am sure that some people will look at an iPad and an iPhone and decide just to get an iPhone and I'm fine with that as well. But over the long arc of time, my own judgment is that iPad has a great future, healthy individual 90-day clicks workout, I donât know, But I'm very bullish on where we can take iPad over time and so we're continuing to invest in the product pipeline.",1
"We're continuing to invest in distribution. If you look at how we did in emerging markets like BRIC countries as an example, we were up 20% for the full year of '14. And so these numbers are impressive and obviously the BRIC countries are growing as a percentage of our total as is developing markets.",1
"And so, it looks a bit different geography to geography, and so thatâs a long answer to your question, but I thought it was important for you to at least share my perspective and you can judge it as you will.",1
And we'll hear from Ben Reitzes from Barclays.,1
"Get back-to-school season voted and the Mac 1 and carried the day and we're really proud of that. I'm proud of the Mac team. It's clear that the -- all the work that we've put into our Notebooks, on the hardware and the software side is resonating with our customers and I think if you went out to college campuses about now, you will see a lot of Mac and there are lot of new Mac Notebooks there based on the sales.",1
"Okay. And then regarding the strength in Mac and the weakness in iPad I guess, what's the message from the market that you take away from that and does that perhaps at all affect your view of doing a convertible type product which in the past has not kind of an Apple's approach, you tend to like to do very focused products there might be that there is something in between that could be quite successful?",1
"So by putting it lumped in the other with iPods and a lot of other things, does that say something about your expectations for that product or do you think that you'll just break it out after a little while?",1
"So that kind of gives you some goalpost and so, the way I look at those numbers are, that on a forward basis what would I expect, obviously we donât give guidance on this kind of stuff is that I still see a fairly large opportunity in people buying their first iPhone ever and I think with these products that we just announced with 6 and 6 Plus that opportunity increases not decreases.",1
"Going forward obviously, the percentage of new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will increase sequentially as we are going to have the full quarter available to us and it's correct that iPhone 6 Plus is supply constrained right now.",1
"Okay and then Tim for you, I was wondering again qualitatively if you could help us understand what you think the mix of repeat buyers is for iPhone 6 let's say over the next year versus first time iPhone customers.",1
"And you know the question in that is, do you believe that because the iPhone 6 is so compelling that that traditional replacement cycle might be accelerated over the next several quarters? And if thatâs ultimately the case, do you in the future run reversion back towards in the elongating of that replacement cycle in future generations?",1
"It is difficult to answer exactly, but let me sort of back up and give you some data, maybe that will help frame the topic. So if you look at some of our top countries and how they did in the mid year of selling a customer the first iPhone they had ever bought.",1
What you would see is that in countries like China over 80% of the people that we were selling the 4s2 were buying the first iPhone ever in the U.S. it was over 60%.,1
"And so those kind of give you some goalpost of large countries in terms of first time ownership at our entry level. As you step across and look at the 5s, which was at that time the top end phone, in China still almost half the people were buying their first iPhone ever buying try this and about a quarter of the U.S. population buying a 5s or buying their first one.",1
"I also believe that the upgrade market for people that were waiting for 6, for iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, as we can see from our order backlog that number is huge. And so I would expect that to go on for some period of time because you have people that time out of contract at different time, no everybody does that at launch time.",1
"And so in the long arc of time, once there is enough supply to meet demand that mix might look differently. Digits clear or at least I think that we will see a difference by geography in terms of preference and we thought that going into the launch of -- and there's no data that we perceived to date that would suggest that, that's not the case and so that's all about all I can say at this point.",1
And so I see both the first time buyer being a great opportunity and the up-grader. Some of the first time buyers are people that have never owned a smartphone before and some of them are switchers from android.,1
"And so, right now, everything, all of those look very good to us, but we're in the early going and we're selling everything we're making and so it's going to take some period of time before we have a better handle on what those numbers will look like in steady state. But I've never felt so great after a launch before, maybe that's the best way to summarized it all.",1
Thanks Toni. Can we have the next question please?,1
From UBS we'll hear from Steven Milunovich.,1
"Thanks. Is there more color you can give us on the mix of 6 and 6 Plus, particularly to the degree you see it in the order book? Our book suggests it's maybe 2.5 to 1, 6 to 6 Plus in the U.S., but and maybe that geographically it's quite different. Asia may be going for the bigger screen is there any color you can give us?",1
"Steve, there's not a lot of color that I can give that I feel is terribly accurate because as I said before, we're selling everything we're making and so essentially what our current sell through looks like is our current supply.",1
"Hey, thanks a lot. Tim, I was wondering what we were to make out of your new segments with the Apple Watch being in the other category. We were just a little surprised to hear that because it seems like such a substantial new category and you could sell may be even tens of millions of unit.",1
"Probably it says nothing about our expectation for the product. We didn't form those categories based on expectations. We looked at current revenue, today revenue, and decided that we would love everything that wasnât a Mac, an iPad, or an iPhone or a service in one kind of category.",1
"Yes Toni. So, on a sequential basis our ASPs for iPhone were up $42. And as you said correctly the reason for the increase was a higher mix of the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.",1
"The second thing that's not as apparent probably, but is more related to that is that last year we increased our channel inventory by $1.3 million. This year, we actually decreased it slightly. And so you have a compounded effect of their launch and a huge change in channel inventory on a year-over-year basis.",1
Okay. Great. Thanks. Congratulations.,1
"And from Bank of Montreal, we'll go to Keith Buckman.",1
"Hi, Tim, I was wondering if you could characterize China a little bit. The numbers I understand weren't as good as the rest of the company this quarter but presumably that was all the delay of the iPhone.",1
So I'm really asking if you talk about the last few weeks and more importantly as you look at December quarter in particular related to some of the political backdrop including the carriers have been mandated not to spend the same level of subsidies.,1
Do you see any of that impacting your opportunities for Apple broadly speaking but more specifically for iPhones as it relates to subsidy levels?,1
"That's a good question. If you -- if you just -- if you look at Greater China Q4 of '14 compared to Q4 of '13, the obvious difference is that we launched the 5s in Q4 of '13 and in this year, we didn't have a new product launch. We were launching in this quarter in Q1 of '15.",1
"So the way that I assess the strength of the market is I look at unit sell-through and to share with you what it was in Greater China, iPhone unit sell through despite no launch in Q4 was up 32% year-over-year.",1
"Yes, and you know pretty much what our product cadence is and what it's been in the past and you know that the holiday season is a period where we have significant product events and we're not providing any guidance for the March quarter.",1
The market was projected by IDC to only grow 13%. So we feel incredibly great about that. Macs were up 54% year-over-year and that's against the IDC's estimate of the market contraction in China of 7% and so those are two stalwarts that were really driving results and so the underlying results look totally different than the reported results because of the channel inventory kind of differences.,1
"The App Store in China is also doing great. The growth there is phenomenal. iPad concreted some during the quarter, but for the full year we did grow -- we were up 9% year-over-year for the full year and so I see lots of positives.",1
As you know China is on the early stages of their huge 4G rollout.,1
"And this weekend -- this past weekend we launched it with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom. This was the first time we've launched a new iPhone with all three carriers and we've done it at the early stages of the 4G rollout and so I am incredibly bullish over it.",1
"In terms of subsidies there are regulatory pressures on subsidies. We have -- we've seen that. However, only 20% of the iPhones that we've been selling in China have had a traditional subsidy applied to it and so the vast majority don't.",1
"And so will it make a difference with that 20%, I don't know yet. Intuitively you were thinking, it would, but it's at least a percentage of a 20% instead of a percentage of 100%.",1
"And also keep in mind Gene if you're trying to extrapolate gross margins into the future, there are so many factors that affect gross margin over time and it's not only transition cost, but its product mix, its foreign exchange, its commodity markets.",1
"No. That's helpful. And a follow-up for Luca, you mentioned that you have typical transition costs that involve in new products you're rolling out. Do those costs start to ease in the March quarter and would that presumably have a positive impact on gross margins in March versus December. Thanks.",1
"In the future, we might decide something different, but for now, in Q1 we're not shipping any iPhone or excuse me, Apple Watches and so it seems appropriate to start it that way.",1
All right. Thanks Tim.,1
And also to be also straight is I am not very anxious in reporting a lot of numbers on Apple Watch because of the -- and giving a lot of detail on it because our competitors are looking for it and so aggregating it is helpful from that point of view as well.,1
"Okay. Got it. And then with regard to my next question is you put out a lot of products and we obviously everybody gives you a lot of credit for the great new product lineup that we have, but everybody talks about what's next.",1
You said in an interview recently on TV that you were working on products that people didn't even speculate on yet and that's pretty hard with Apple considering how many people watch your company and write about it.,1
So I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that may be in terms of your excitement around new products and what did you mean by that comment and how do you feel about the future in light of that comment you made? Thanks a lot.,1
"I am incredibly optimistic about the future. We've already announced two new categories in the last 60 days or so or less than 60 days with Apple Pay and Apple Watch. So shipping the watch early next year and obviously we're working on other things as well and to the degree that I can keep that in the cone of silence, I am going to do it and so I am not sure what to say.",1
I am not going to give any answer or anything. We look at a lot of different things and we're fortunate to have a lot of creative people here that want to change the world and have a lot of great ideas.,1
Thanks. And could we have the next question please?,1
"Everybody is focused on everything except for the customer and putting the customer at the center of the experience and making something very elegant. And so I would look at those things and when I look at those things, I would as an investor, I feel great, as a personal investor I feel great.",1
"Hey, good afternoon. A follow-up to Ben's question in terms of the last year you had higher expectations in terms of new product categories and the iPhone 6 launch but there are some investors who think about Apple and a products type of story.",1
"So Tim, I'd be interested in how you think about the story broadly in 2015 and kind of exciting things to be focused on as an investor and then I have a follow-up to Luca.",1
"Well for Apple if as an investor I would hope that people would look at what we've done and what we've delivered and the power and strength of the product line that we've announced and maybe more importantly then all the stuff that you see, is to look at the skills within this company.",1
And the fact that I think it's the only company on the planet that has the ability to integrate hardware and software and services at a world-class level and that in itself allows Apple to play in so many different areas and so the challenge becomes one of deciding which ones to say no to and which ones to say yes to and want to focus not once -- not once do we have any great ideas and we always had more ideas than we have resources to deal with.,1
"And so I would look at that. I would look at what we talked about last week. Things like continuity and if you use your imagination and think about where that goes, there is no other company that can do this. Apple is the only one and I think this becomes so incredibly important moving forward for customers living in an environment where they're using multiple devices.",1
"And so I would look at the skills, the capabilities, the passion of the company and the creative engine has never been stronger. And I think you can see that from the Apple Watch, you can see that with Apple Pay. Apple Pay is a classic app for taking something that is incredibly old, outdated, kludgy.",1
There was a partial offset in the quarter from the transition cost that we incurred typically when we moved to a new product.,1
"And if we look forward to calendar fiscal Q1, last year you had a very substantial ASP increase, should we be thinking about a similar kind of ASP increase this quarter given I think a widespread belief that availability on the 6 Plus has been even more constrained and that we could see a much higher percentage of 6 Plus as a percentage of total iPhones shipped in the quarter and next quarter?",1
"iPad continues to lead the U.S. education tablet market with 90% share based on the latest data from IDC. In the September quarter the St. Paul public school in Minnesota purchased over 22,000 iPad Airs and over 5,000 iPad Minis in the first race of the district's personalized learning through technology plan that will ultimately equip every student with an iPad.",1
"So, due to the size, complexity and different needs of our channels around the world we've determined that a five to seven week average range for both iPhone and iPad channel inventory is more appropriate and that will be our target range going forward. However, given the backlog for our new products, we expect to exit the December quarter within our old four to six weeks target range.",1
"We'll be creating a new reporting category called other products. This will encompass everything we report in the accessories category today including Beats headphones and speakers, Apple TV and peripherals and accessories for iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod.",1
"In addition, we will begin to include iPod sales in the other products category and we will also reflect sales of Apple Watch in this line item once it begins shipping in early calendar 2015.",1
"So to recap, beginning in Q1 '15. our products reporting categories will be iPhone, iPad, Mac, services and other products. We wanted to give analysts and investors a heads up on these plans so you can reflect them in your models accordingly.",1
We'll also reclassify historical results to be consistent with these newer groupings and we'll provide that information on our Investor Relations website when we release Q1 results.,1
"And finally, our distribution channels have evolved and expanded significantly in the last couple of years including traditional resellers, consumer electronic stores, mass retailers, distributors and carriers, and each of these channels have the different distribution model. Today, iPhone is sold in over 200,000 locations around the world and iPad is sold in more than 100,000.",1
"In addition, revenue from emerging markets has increased considerably over the last few years and now accounts for over quarter of our sales. And channel inventory requirements in those markets tend to be much longer.",1
So with that let's open the call to questions and we ask that you please limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up.,1
"This means that going forward our reportable segment will be Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and the rest of Asia-Pacific with the retail no longer classified as a segment.",1
(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"Thank you very much. Good afternoon. My first question is with regard to Apple Pay, which we actually used this afternoon and where it was rolled out it actually worked pretty well which was nice, but could you provide some more color, Tim and Luca, on how you see the business model for Apple?",1
"And maybe from a high level perspective, if you see there's more over time becoming a standalone business like you look at iTunes, or is this more just a way to sell incremental product?",1
"Shannon, hi, it's Tim. The -- what we wanted to achieve with Apple Pay was first and foremost to have an incredible consumer experience. And so we focused very much on making it elegant and simple and hopefully your trails have proven them. I know I used it over the weekend and it worked fantastically.",1
"We also wanted to focus on security and privacy, and so we see huge issues with the security of the traditional credit card system. And many people that have entered mobile payments are doing still in a way that they want to monetize the data that they collect from the customers and we think customers in general do not want this that they'd like to keep their data private. And so, we wanted to have ease of use, security and privacy and maximize all three.",1
"By doing so, we think we will sell more devices because we think it's a killer feature. It's far better than reaching in your pocket book and trying to find the card that you're looking for and half the time it's not working.",1
"Second, to better reflect our evolving products and services, we'll be making some changes to our product summary reporting. We will continue to report iPhone, iPad and Macs as separate line items and we'll also have a category that we refer to as services and this will encompass everything we report under the heading of iTunes software and services today including content, apps, licensing and other services and beginning this month it will also include Apple Pay.",1
"Accordingly, beginning in Q1 '15, we'll be including the results of our retail stores in the geographic segments where the stores are located providing a consolidated view of regional performance that is consistent with the way our executive team measures the business.",1
"And so as Nancy was saying in her closing comments, we'll be reporting Apple Pay in the services line item on the data sheet. And so, we see it as an incredible service that is the most customer-centric mobile payment system that there is. And we are very proud of it and can't wait to sign up more retailers and also extend it around the world.",1
"We launched our fourth accelerated share repurchase program at the end of August spending $9 billion. We also spent $8 billion to repurchase $81 million Apple's shares to open market transactions, paid $2.8 billion in dividends and equivalence and utilized over $300 million to net share sell vesting employee RSUs.",1
"We are fully consistent and continue to strive. Our item store generated all time record billings of $5.4 billion in the September quarter, up 22% year-over-year, thanks to the tremendous momentum of the app store. Developers around the world have embraced the iOS platform and keep broadening the appeal of our thoughtfully designed app store to a large, loyal and engaged customer base.",1
Across all of our programs the number of registered app developers has grown by 22% in the last year and we are rapidly approaching 10 million. We are seeing especially strong interest in the enterprise with a number of registered developers is up 39% over a year ago.,1
"Our retail stores also generated strong results. Revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago and a new September quarter record. We opened 10 new stores and completed the remodels of three stores during the quarter ending with a total of 437 stores, 41% of which are outside the United States.",1
"We are projecting a total of approximately 25 new store openings in fiscal '15, about three quarters of which will be outside the U.S. We also plan to remodel about five stores over the course of the year.",1
"With an average of 432 stores opened in the September quarter average revenue per store was $11.9 million compared to $10.9 million in the year ago quarter. We hosted 102 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, which translates to over 18,000 visitors per store per week.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $155.2 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decline of $9.3 billion. We are continue to execute our capital return program aggressively with the total spend of over $20 billion in just the September quarter.",1
"So, we've already taken action on over $94 billion of our $130 billion capital return program including $68 billion in share repurchases with five quarters remaining to its completion. We remained firmly committed to our objective of delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both business performance and return of capital.",1
"First, to better serve our customers and optimize our results around the world we are collaborating like never before across our direct and indirect channels.",1
"As we said before, we review our capital allocation regularly. We have solicited feedback on our capital return program from shareholders in the past and we will continue to do so. We plan to report on our conclusions in a timeframe similar to last year.",1
"Now, as we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $63.5 billion and $66.5 billion compared to $57.6 billion in the year ago quarter.",1
This represents a double-digit revenue increase despite significant foreign exchange headwinds from the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $325 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.5%.,1
"Also today our Board has declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share payable on November 13, 2014, to shareholders of record as of November 10, 2014.",1
"With that, I will hand it over to Nancy for some final remarks.",1
"Thanks, Luca. We'd like to let you know about some reporting changes that we'll be making beginning with the release of our Q1 '15 results.",1
"There -- we do not charge the customer for the benefit. We do not charge the merchant for the benefit. However, there are commercial terms between Apple and the issuing banks, but we're not disclosing what they are, like any other contractual arrangement those are private things.",1
"Thank you. And then, Luca, if you could talk a little bit about the impact of currency. In IBM's results this morning they talked substantially about potential pressure going forward from currency. So could you walk us through how your hedges work, how we should think about currency and how you reflected in at least the current quarter guidance?",1
"Yes, sorry about that. I have one for Luca and one for Tim please. Luca the question for you is a bit of a follow up from the last one which is that we saw a pretty robust sequential increase in ASPs this quarter in the iPhone and I was wondering if you could qualitatively help us understand whether that was a higher mix of new phones than you typically see in the September quarter or was it really a function of the new phones having a richer ASP?",1
"No, we price our products in a way that is in general reflective of pricing here in the United States and it's a pricing that we want to keep in place for reasonable periods of time. We do not like to make sudden changes to our pricing.",1
"And so, I couldnât be happier with the way the demand looks. Nancy's comment at the end was meant to tell you that we do not envision as of today being able to achieve the extra inventory in the channel that we believe is needed when you think about the long food chains in some of the emerging markets where the distribution channels are not as official, so that's the purpose of that comment.",1
"Okay, that's helpful, thank you.",1
We'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Thanks. Luca I wonder if you can quantify the currency headwind on gross margin in the December quarter, just because there is a big focus on currency across tech right now and should we expect price harmonization if the dollar remained strong? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"Katy, it's you know I said that there's headwinds from foreign exchange are going to be significant. So -- and I would tell you that they are more significant when you look at it from a year-over-year basis that it is on a sequential basis because clearly the dollar has been strengthening for quite a while particularly against certain currencies like the Yen or the Canadian dollar a lot of the emerging market currencies. So it's again impact and that's the reason why we wanted to call it out.",1
Will you do any price harmonization if the dollar remained strong?,1
"Okay, then as a follow up, I wonder if you can comment on the how NAND capacity and SKU mix is tracking versus your expectations for iPhone 6?",1
"And -- but that said, I am really confident that supply is going to be great and that's the reason you see incredibly strong guidance that we're giving from $63.5 billion to $66.5 billion.",1
"Yeah Katy, it's Tim. At this point, we're selling everything we made. And so it's difficult to say that we've been -- that we've absolutely made it well on the SKU mix and the split between the iPhone 6 and the 6 Plus.",1
"From everything we can tell, we've done a pretty good job on that. But I'll stop short of saying there is no issue at all, because it's hard to tell when you are at a point where you are selling everything you are making. It is a good problem to have.",1
"Got it, congrats on the quarter.",1
"Thank you, very much, thank you.",1
Thanks Katy. Can we have the next question please?,1
From Sanford Bernstein we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi. And Toni you may want to check your mute button.,1
"At -- but at this point, it's just very difficult to gauge what the true demand is. When you see it's very unusual to see every country having a marked improvement over the previous year and that's what we're seeing on iPhone.",1
"It's very difficult to gauge demand without first achieving finding the balance and it's clear that as of today, and certainly as of the end of the quarter where you're looking at the data, we're not nearly, we're not close, we're not on the same plan.",1
"Yeah. Definitely, Shannon. As you know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened quite significantly against most currencies in recent weeks. When we looked at our Q4 results actually the impact was fairly limited combination of the hedging program and the fact that the dollar really strengthened towards the very end of the quarter.",1
"And more broadly, I know it's still early, but how should we think about the gross margin path as the iPhone 6 family ramps versus what we saw with the 5S and 5C cycle. I guess you can answer that specifically. I'm trying to figure out if you characterize this as a fairly normal cycle in terms of expected cost improvements over the life of the product.",1
Not much impact in Q4. It is becoming a significant headwind in Q1 both on a year-over-year basis and on a sequential basis.,1
"As I said before, we have reflected the new FX situation at current levels into our guidance that we provided for both revenue and gross margins. And it's a fact of life if the U.S. dollar strengthens, that creates a headwind for us both in revenue and margins for our business outside the United States.",1
"As you know, we have a comprehensive hedging program in place that mitigates the impact of foreign exchange. Over time, of course, these hedges roll off and get replaced by new hedges at new spot levels, and so the protection that you get from hedging program is temporary. But again, the guidance that we provided fully reflects that current situation in the FX markets.",1
"Thanks Shannon, can we have the next question please?",1
And from Goldman Sachs we'll hear from Bill Shope.,1
"Okay. Thank you. Could you comment on how we should think about the key swing factors for gross margins in the December quarter, obviously outside the FX impact you just mentioned, Luca?",1
"Yes, Bill let me start with put and takes of margins for Q1. I would say that on the positive we are so pleased with the launch of new phones you might have seen phenomenal. So we think we're going to be getting favorable impact from iPhone mix.",1
And so I donât want to leave you with a view that we know that we're going to get to a supply-demand balance on both of the new products this quarter because I donât know that at this point.,1
"Of course, we're also going to be getting some positive leverage from the higher revenues that we guided to and we continue to see fairly favorable commodity environment. So these are the things that are on the positive side.",1
On the negative side I've talked about FX. Obviously we have launched a lot of new products even in the last six weeks and we've got transition costs as we move from current products to new products and that tends to be a headwind.,1
"And every time we launch new products, we make them better and what that means is that our cost structures tend to go up when we produce new products. We have a very good track record of taking those cost structures down over time and so when you take the positives and negatives that I have just mentioned that is what gives us the guidance that we just provided.",1
"Okay great. And then my second question is, looking at that current supply constraints of the iPhone, could you confirm that your guidance is assuming you will reach supply demand balance before the end of the quarter, I think that's what was implied by your commentary on channel inventory?",1
"And related to that, could you give us some more color on what you see as the key bottlenecks at this point for supply on the iPhone side?",1
"Bill its Tim. The ramp itself is going great. The chances are ever in our history, so I couldnât be happier with it. That said, today demand is far obstructing supply. It is unclear looking at the data when supply will catch up with demand.",1
The other thing that's happened is that the decline that we've been experiencing in Hong Kong moderated. And so it's still down year over year but less so than it was and part of that is the compare is an easier compare.,1
"From Piper Jaffray, Mike Olson.",1
[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.,1
"And so the installed base is clearly a piece of it getting the trade-in program going, and the secondary market moving has been helpful in that as well. And, of course, ultimately the thing that builds the installed base is to make customers happy, and that's our -- always our top objective is to have satisfied customers.",1
"Our Services set an all-time record of $14.5 billion, growing 16% year-over-year. We established new all-time records in many Services categories and September quarter records in each geographic segment. Iâll cover this in more detail later.",1
"Company gross margin was 38.2%. This was up 20 basis points sequentially, due to cost savings and a higher mix of services, partially offset by a different mix of products. Productsâ gross margin was 29.8%, growing 10 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings, partially offset by a different mix. Services gross margin was 66.9% decreasing 30 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix.",1
"Let me get into more detail for each of our product categories; iPhone revenue was $26.4 billion, as we did not have availability of new iPhone models during the September quarter this year, which we had mentioned during our call in July. While COVID-19 and social distancing measures impacted store operations in a significant manner, demand for iPhone remained very strong. In fact, through mid-September, customer demand for our current product lineup grew double digits, and was well above our expectations.",1
"Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high, thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the last survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined.",1
"Turning to Services, as I said, we set an all-time revenue record of $14.5 billion. We grew strong double digits and set all-time records in App Store, Cloud Services, Music, Advertising and Payment Services. We also set an all-time record in Apple Care, as in-store traffic improved and we were able to support more customers. Our new services, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple Card, are also contributing to overall services growth, and continue to add users, content and features. The key drivers for our Services growth, all continue to be moving in the right direction.",1
"First, our installed base continues to grow and is at an all-time high across each major product category. Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the September quarter, with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments.",1
"Third, paid subscriptions grew more than 35 million sequentially, and we now have over 585 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 135 million from just a year ago. With this momentum, we are very confident to reach and exceed our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020.",1
"Finally, as Tim mentioned, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services offerings, and are adding new service offerings that we think our customers will love, like Apple One and Apple Fitness+.",1
"Wearables, home and accessories established a new September quarter record, with revenue of $7.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. We set September quarter records in every geographic segment and for each of the three product categories; Wearables, Home and Accessories. As a result, our wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 130 company. Importantly, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter, being new to the product. Weâre very excited about the future of this category, including the recent launches of our new products; Apple Watch Series 6 NFC, HomePod Mini, and the MagSafe ecosystem of accessories.",1
"Next, Iâd like to talk about Mac; revenue was by far an all-time record at $9 billion, up 29% over last year and $1.6 billion above our previous record, in spite of supply constraints during the quarter. We grew strong double digits in each geographic segment and set all time revenue records in the Americas, and the rest of Asia Pacific, as well as September quarter records in Europe and Japan.",1
Weâve seen amazing customer response to the new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro and very strong demand during the back to school season.,1
"IPad performance was also very impressive, with revenue of $6.8 billion, up 46%, and our highest September quarter revenue in eight years despite supply constraints. Demand exceeded our expectations around the world, as we grew very strong double digits in every geographic segment, including an all-time record in Japan and a September quarter record in the Americas.",1
"Both Mac and iPad are incredibly relevant products for our customers in the current working and learning environments, and we are delighted that the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research, measure customer satisfaction at 93% for Mac and 95% for iPad. With this level of customer satisfaction and with around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter being new to that product, it is no surprise that the active installed base for both products reached a new all-time high.",1
"In the Enterprise market, our products are helping companies grow their business, while achieving their sustainability goals. One example is Vestas, a leading producer of wind turbines. Vestas is using Apple products and native iOS apps extensively across their operations to deliver renewable energy efficiently to customers worldwide. For instance, they use iPads to help optimize onsite construction operations, cutting crane usage on average by one day per project. Vestas field technicians are using iPhone for work orders, troubleshooting a remote collaboration, saving them 400,000 service hours annually. More recently, theyâve started piloting the augmented reality capability in iPads, to help customers visualize wind turbine installations.",1
"We ended the quarter with almost $192 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $5.5 billion of new term debt, and decreased short term borrowing facilities by $6.2 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $112 billion. As a result, net cash was $79 billion at the end of the quarter, as we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned nearly $22 billion to shareholders during the September quarter, including $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $18 billion to open market repurchases of 168.7 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 3.1 million shares, in the final settlement of our 16th ASR.",1
"We also achieved new September quarter records in the vast majority of countries that we track, including among others, The U.S., Canada Brazil, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Russia, India, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Products revenue was $50.1 billion with very strong underlying performance across each product category. Our products outside of iPhone grew a combined 30%, despite supply constraints on iPad, Mac and Apple Watch throughout the quarter. For iPhone, through mid-September, customer demand grew double-digits. As a result of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in aggregate, and in each of our major product categories.",1
"We reported total revenue of $64.7 billion for the September quarter, up 1% from a year ago. This is a very impressive level of performance, when we consider that this year; we did not launch and ship any new iPhone models during the quarter. Outside of iPhone, we grew 25% in aggregate, and had strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in each of our product categories. We set all-time records for Mac and Services, and a September quarter record for Wearables, Home and Accessories.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report today a new September quarter revenue record, which caps a remarkable level of performance for our fiscal year 2020, during which we set new all-time records for revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow, in spite of an extremely volatile and challenging macro environment. We could not be more proud of the way our team has innovated and executed, throughout this unprecedented period of uncertainty.",1
"The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini boasts powerful breakthroughs like an edge-to-edge Super Retina XDR display, unprecedented durability with a new ceramic shield, developed with our partners at Corning, new MagSafe charging and accessories, the fastest ever A14 Bionic chip, and a new dual camera system, driven by computational photography.",1
"In a year that has been enormously challenging, our retail teams, contact centers, and all those who work with our customers most closely, have gone to creative and dedicated [lengths] [ph] to keep serving our customers. From adapting our stores for contactless pickup to new Apple Express storefronts, to new online customer support options. Amid store closings, reopenings and reimagining, these teams have been an unfailing source of energy, creativity and determination.",1
"Innovation isnât just about what you make; itâs about how you approach problems, and these teams and every team across Apple having not faced a single question this year that they havenât found an answer to with passion and resolve. Their actions didnât just meet the moment; they will make us a better company moving forward.",1
"The pandemic has hit home for all of us, and at Apple we have seen it as a call to action. We have seen the pain in our communities. Many of us have seen our children work hard to adapt to remote learning, and we all know that the road ahead is uncertain. This quarter and throughout the year, our response to this crisis has been to ask, how can we help?",1
"In terms of COVID-19 response, that has meant sourcing and donating millions of face masks, designing and manufacturing millions of face shields, and scaling the production of millions of test kits. But we have tried to live our values more broadly. Weâve pledged $100 million to our new racial equity and justice initiative. Weâve committed to be fully carbon neutral by 2030 across our entire supply chain and device usage, as massive wildfires, hurricanes and floods, bring home the consequences of climate change for all of us. And weâve deepened our enduring educational partnerships, from coding education beginning in elementary school, to new efforts with dozens of historically black colleges and universities.",1
"One of the many areas where COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact is in education. As teachers, students and parents alike work hard to keep education relevant, creative and effective, our products have helped them meet the moment. In a typical year, the back-to-school season is a bustling time for us. This year, that was true in the biggest way ever. Weâve helped school districts around the world meet this moment in an unprecedented way, including starting nine of our 10 largest school district deployments ever, that alone will support over 1 million students and teachers. We have also supported these deployments and educators and learners everywhere with free tools and training, reaching over 150,000 teachers and millions of parents and students around the world.",1
"Looking forward, we feel great optimism about the road in front of us. Weâre in the midst of our most prolific product introduction period ever. In addition to the announcement of HomePod Mini, which achieves unmatched sound quality and Siri and smart-home capabilities in a small and affordable format, we just marked the beginning of a new era for iPhone, with the arrival of our first 5G enabled devices.",1
"The iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max take all of this to an even higher level, driven by the most powerful photo and video tools ever delivered by a smartphone, including an all new LiDAR scanner and the ability to shoot an Apple ProRAW and full Dolby video. And of course, all of these devices bring the 5G experience users have been waiting for, with lightning fast download and uploads, a new standard in video streaming, more responsive gaming and much more. The early product reviews have been tremendously positive, and our customers have been similarly excited to get their hands on this next era of devices. Weâre very optimistic about what the next few weeks will bring.",1
"With that, Iâll hand things over to Luca.",1
"Weâre also seeing a very positive response to our September announcement, the all new Apple Watch Series 6, boasts powerful new health and wellness features, including a blood oxygen sensor, a next generation altimeter, and a wide variety of new colors and bands. The potential for Apple Watchâs powerful health and wellness capabilities continues to grow.",1
"Just yesterday, the government of Singapore and Apple launched LumiHealth, a first of its kind program designed to encourage healthy activity and behaviors using Apple Watch. Created in collaboration with a team of physicians and public health experts, LumiHealth uses technology and behavioral insights to encourage Singaporeans to keep healthy and complete wellness challenges through their Apple Watch and iPhone. Singapore is a trailblazer here, and weâre proud to be their partner.",1
"Our iPad lineup continues to set the pace for the category, including the new iPad Air now shipping with the A14 Bionic, our most powerful chip ever. We announced Apple Fitness Plus, which delivers deep personalization and integration across the fitness tools our users love and depend on. And Apple One, launching tomorrow, is the easiest way for users to enjoy Appleâs services, like Music, TV+, Arcade, iCloud, News+ and Fitness+ on a single plan that is right for them and their family.",1
"Looking across services more broadly, weâre really excited about what we see. This was a record quarter for the App Store, AppleCare, Cloud Services, Music and Payment Services. The App Store in particular, continues to play an essential role in helping small businesses, educational institutions and workplaces adapt to COVID-19. Apple TV+ continues to impress, from fan favorites like Ted Lasso, which has won a worldwide audience with its hopeful tone during challenging times, to critical and award praise, including a Primetime Emmy for Billy Crudup in the morning show. Luca will speak in greater detail about our expectations for the December quarter. Without giving away too much, I can tell you that this year has a few more exciting things in store.",1
"Before I hand things off, I want to offer one more comment on resilience, because I think if I had to describe our performance this quarter in a single word, itâs resilient. Financial performance aside, I donât think this year will be a time that any of us look back on with great fondness or nostalgia. Those of us, who wake up every day, hoping for a return to normal, can count ourselves fortunate. Others donât have that luxury. There is the great pain of a lost loved one, the uncertainty and fear of a lost job, a deep well of concern for people we care about, who we are not able to see. A sense of opportunities missed, of plans delayed, of time lost. Even though weâre apart, it has been obvious this year that around the company, teams and colleagues have been leaning on and counting on each other more than in normal times. I think that instinct, that resilience has been an essential part of how we have navigated this year.",1
"Work canât solve for all the things weâre missing right now, but a shared sense of purpose goes a long way. A belief that we can do more together than we can alone, that people of goodwill, driven by creativity and passion, and that certain itch of a big idea, can still do things that help other people in our own small way to teach, to learn, to create or just to relax at a time like this. Even as the things we make require us to operate at the very cutting edge of technology, in materials, products and ideas that didnât exist just a few years ago, this year has forced us to face plainly the things that make us human; disease, resilience and hope. You never wished for a year like this one, but I couldnât be prouder of the team, the work we have done and the small role we have played in helping our communities find hope and resilience in this time.",1
"Before looking ahead, I want to provide just a few highlights for the amazing fiscal year we just completed. In fiscal â20, we grew revenue by 6% to $274.5 billion, a new all-time record. We showed remarkable resilience throughout the year, as we were able to grow both revenue and installed base of active devices in every quarter.",1
"During the September quarter, including $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents and $18 billion through open market repurchases of 168.7 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 3.1 million shares in the final settlement of our 16th ASR. Before looking ahead, I want to provide just a few highlights for the amazing fiscal year we just completed. In fiscal 20, we grew revenue by 6% to $274.5 billion and new all-time record.",1
"We showed remarkable resilience throughout the year as we were able to grow both revenue and installed base of active devices in every quarter. In spite of the most challenging economic environment we can remember, we said new revenue records in the Americas, in Europe and in the rest of Asia Pacific. We grow our business outside of iPhone by 16%. We grew earnings per share 10% to a new all-time record and most importantly, we continue to deliver innovative products and services that our customers love.",1
"We've got Katy, as you know; we've announced a number of services over the last couple of years. And we are ramping those between Apple TV plus and Apple News plus and Apple Kay, we've got Apple Card. We've got Apple Fitness Plus coming. We've got a number of services that have been launched a bit longer that are doing really well from the app store to iCloud, and So there's a lot of room their input and potential there. I have no idea how the DOJ suit will go, but I think it's a long way from a conclusion on it.",1
"Yes, we don't have anything to announce today at our hardware bundle but backing up a bit. And we do view that people like to pay for their hardware are at least some substantial portion of it monthly. And so that's the reason that we have implemented installments in our stores and online. And that's the reason you see in some of the channels too selling the hardware on a per month kind of basis. If that begins to look like a subscription, perhaps to some buyers because they're used to holding the phone for a fixed period of time and then turning it over and using the residual value of that phone in a way that gives them a de facto kind of subsidy on a new phone. And so there is something today in the market that works somewhat similar. On the services side; we have -- we had customers coming to us and asking for an easier way to buy all of our services. And we wanted to provide that and we're looking forward to tomorrow to getting Apple one out there.",1
It will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Thank you. Good afternoon. New technologies, including the chips that support 5G put upward pressure on cost this year. But you managed to leave ASPS for iPhones relatively unchanged this product cycle. How should we think about the margin profiles of iPhone 12 relative to past iPhone cycles?",1
"Hi, Katy. Obviously, we don't provide any outlook at the gross margin level for product categories. What I said in my prepared remarks, we expect gross margins in total for the company to be pretty much in line with what we've seen during the last quarter. Because obviously, as you said, it's very good, right, because we are offering the new phones at price points that are essentially unchanged. And we are taking on a lot of new technology into the phones. I would say the commodity environment is good. For the first time in many, many quarters, I don't have to say that foreign exchange is a headwind and getting into the quarter is not going to be a factor during the quarter.",1
"As we've made it clear in our comments, we are bullish about our sales performance expectation, so we should be getting some leverage. And so I think that the gross margin dynamics are good and it's very good to see that we're able to offer so much more technology and still able to deliver the level of gross margins that I think investors are expecting.",1
"Okay and shifting to the services business. This isn't dependent on certainly any one service but licensing and other historically has been a driver of growth. That's where the ad based revenue comes in. When you think about the Google antitrust pressure, what's the risk that you see some shrinkage in your licensing and others segment within services and do you see opportunities for other services to make up for any potential weakness?",1
That will come from Evercore's Amit Daryanani.,1
"And so we are incredibly optimistic about what we've seen so far. Obviously, we started taking pre orders five days ago and it's a bit early for the phone. But we think that there are a lot of tailwinds this year for iPhone for the entire cycle. Some of the comments that Tim has already made, right, we've got the best lineup of iPhones that we've ever had. We got an install base of iPhone that is very large continues to grow. It's an all time high. Obviously, 5G is a once in a decade, opportunity. And as you've seen in some markets, certainly here in the United States, carrier offers are very aggressive. And so that is very good for consumers and ultimately, very good for us. So very, very optimistic, given what we've seen so far.",1
"Thanks for taking my question. I guess I have two as well. First off, Tim, on iPhones, you talked about the iPhone install data thing being the highest and largest ever been satisfaction rates, obviously pretty high. And our data would suggest replacement cycles are getting elongated. And if I take all of that together, along with the fact that, if iPhone user like me with embarrassingly high weekly usage rate, does that in aggregate give you better confident, better clarity that we could enter an extensive period of iPhone revenue growth versus what we seen the last couple of years.",1
"We're very bullish on this cycle, very bullish on it, because as I sort of step back from it and look at what we've now done, we have for the first time ever, we've launched four iPhones. And there is an iPhone for everyone there. It is the strongest lineup we've ever had by far, we have -- we do have a very large, loyal and growing install base. And we're also reaching out to switchers. And so I'm very optimistic there. We've got a once in a decade opportunity with 5G. There's a lot of excitement around 5G. And we've got some aggressive offers in the marketplace. And so when I think about all of those, I'm really and I look at the initial data points that we've got on the iPhone 12 and the 12 Pro, we are off to a great start.",1
"Got it. And I guess, Luca had a follow up to you on the services gross margin it just was to kind of continue to move higher rather nicely. Do you think this level at 67% essentially is sustainable? And what do you think are the two or three factors that are enabling these gross margins to remain here as we go forward?",1
"I mean, obviously, we're very pleased with the level of gross margins in services, as you said; they've been expanding almost 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The reason for that is, of course that, we are growing the services revenue, and therefore we're getting leverage on a lot of these services, right. Some of it, as explained in the past, we have a portfolio of services that got different margin profiles. And so sometimes, depending on the mix of products we have, we can see margin expansion through mix, as well. And so, but we're also launching new services that where we need to invest heavily up front. And but we think we've been able to show, for example, this year that we've launched a lot of new services, made all the necessary investments and still being able to expand gross margin.",1
"So we feel quite confident about that trajectory that we have, that we have for services and we're very, very happy to see the customer response to really all of them, because as we've mentioned earlier, I mean, we've seen revenue records across essentially every category and in across the entire world, right? We've seen September quarter records in every geography around the world. So of the dynamics, all the levers that we have in the services business are working very well right now. And that translates also into margin, of course.",1
We'll hear from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.,1
"Awesome, thank you so much for that context and given us some of the levers to think about. I'd like to ask a little bit more of a strategic one, a little bit longer term in nature. I think one thing is interesting about the Apple one bundle is the desire two bundles in the first place, I guess. I'm wondering, and some investors have asked me this as well, is that why wouldn't you also take that rationale perhaps in hardware, perhaps maybe AirPods and iPhone or AirPods watch and iPhone? Because if it makes sense to bundle services, would it also make sense to bundle hardware? And if that's not the case, then are there benefits of services, bundling that don't necessarily translate to hardware bundling? Thanks.",1
"So as I said, Jay, we're not providing a range, for the reasons that I explained during my prepared remarks. So you need to keep in mind a couple of things that are unique about this quarter versus the past. And that I mentioned again, the launch timing of the phones is different from the past. So we are launching the new iPhones, four weeks into the quarter for two models for the 12 and 12 Pro and seven weeks into the quarter for the other two, the iPhone Mini and for 12 Pro Max. So that is something to keep in mind as you think about the growth rates. With regard to all the other product categories, as I said, we are expecting to grow double digits essentially across the board for the rest of our products and for services.",1
"As we move ahead into the December quarter, Iâd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to, at the beginning of the call.",1
"Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit more about China? And in terms of linearity, I think Luca, you'd mentioned that services in all regions were up at an all time high. I'm not sure exactly what your comment was. But, maybe give us a little idea of, whether you're seeing any blowback or benefits in the Huawei situation and just dig a bit more into the trends we're seeing in China, and then have a follow up. Thank you.",1
"Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we will not be issuing revenue guidance for the coming quarter. However, we are providing some insights on our expectations for the December quarter for our product categories. These directional comments, assume that COVID related impacts to our business in November and December are similar to what weâre seeing in October.",1
"We just started shipping iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, and weâre off to a great start. We are also excited to start preorders on iPhone 12 Mini and 12 Pro Max next Friday. Given the tremendously positive response, we expect iPhone revenue to grow during the December quarter, despite shipping iPhone 12 and 12 Pro four weeks into the quarter, and iPhone 12 Mini and 12 Pro Max seven weeks into the quarter. We expect all other products in aggregate to grow double digits, and we also expect services to continue to grow double digits.",1
"For gross margin, we expect it to be similar to our most recent quarters, despite the costs associated with the launch of several new products. For OpEx, we expect to be between $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, and the tax rate to be around 16%.",1
"Finally today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of common stock, payable November 12, 2020 to shareholders of record as of November 9, 2020.",1
"Thank you, Luca. We ask you that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please.",1
"Certainly we'll hear first today from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.",1
"Thanks, Shannon. If you look at China, and look at last quarters, I'll talk about both last quarter and this quarter, the last quarter, what we saw was our non iPhone business was up strong double digit for the full quarter. And then if you look at iPhone and you look at it in two parts one, pre mid September, which is pre the point at which the previous year, we would have launched iPhones that period of time which was the bulk of the quarter iPhone was growing from a customer demand point of view. And of course not shipping new iPhones for the last two weeks of September makes that number in the aggregate a negative but the net is the underlying business in China last quarter was very strong and perhaps very different than you might think from just a quick look at the stated number",1
"Yes, thank you so much. I guess I appreciate the guidance for revenue to grow but I guess my question, perhaps, if I could, is relative to seasonality, you guys over the last five years of seasonality is typically above 50% quarter-on-quarter, do you think that you can beat that, even with the later release? And I have a follow up.",1
"In terms of this quarter, given the explanation for last quarter and the momentum that we've got, and as importantly given the initial data points that we see on iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, although we don't guide to revenue as Lucas said, I would tell you that we're confident that we will grow this quarter in China. And so we're very bullish on what's going on there.",1
"A little more color on last quarter, we had a much more significant inventory draw down on the channel side than other regions. And so that is one reason why the numbers are different than other regions. And additionally, the new products in the year ago quarter were a higher percentage of our iPhone sales than they were in other regions. So hopefully that explains what's going on in China.",1
"In terms of the market there, 5G is fairly advanced there. They're forecasting 600,000 base stations by the end of the year. And so we're entering the market at a very good time, and with the reception that we've gotten so far; we're very confident there.",1
"Okay, great. And then can you talk a bit about just overall in the world, the cadence that you see sort of for the 5G adoption launch, what you see will be sort of the key drivers, obviously, there's a fair amount of subsidies going on in the US at this point. Thank you.",1
"Yes, we're working hard to provide the best experience for iPhone users. To do so we've been collaborating closely with carriers all around the world to ensure iPhone has great throughput and coverage and battery and call quality. We've completed 5G testing so far on over 100 carriers in over 30 regions. And so it's pretty, it's pretty pervasive around the world. But grantedly, it will continue to roll out in more places as carriers continue to expand their coverage. And this will happen every week. And so it's just going to get better. There are obvious places in the world where it's more ahead than others. But we feel like we are entering at a sort of at exactly the right time.",1
That will be from Jeriel Ong from Deutsche Bank.,1
"When we first began to grapple with COVID-19, I said there are worse things for a company whose business is innovation, than having to periodically do just about everything in an entirely new way. This year, we not only launched our most powerful and compelling generation of hardware, software and Services ever, we did it in a way that pushes to reimagine every part of that innovation process, down to how we share these announcements with the world and how we get new products into our customersâ hands. Working from kitchen tables and bedrooms, in distanced office settings and rework labs and manufacturing facilities, the team rebuilt every part of the plane while it was mid-air, and the results speak for themselves.",1
"When you pull back the lens to the entire fiscal year, itâs a testament to the teamâs work and to the resilience of the business in the era of COVID-19. This year, we set an all-time revenue record of $274.5 billion, growing 6% year-on-year. We grew every quarter, set all-time yearly records in Mac, Wearables Home and Accessories, and Services, and grew by double-digits in every product category outside of iPhone.",1
"On Services, we saw stronger-than-expected performance across the board. Geographically, we set September quarter records in the Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific. We also set a September quarter record in India, thanks in part to a very strong reception to this quarterâs launch of our online store in the country. Greater China is the region that was most heavily impacted by the absence of the new iPhones during the September quarter, still we beat our internal expectations in the region, growing non-iPhone revenue strong double digits and iPhone customer demand grew through mid-September.",1
"Toni, thanks for the question. The guidance that we are providing if you look at it at the midpoint implies an acceleration of growth from the performance that we've seen during the course of fiscal 2019.",1
"We continue to run SG&A tightly. Obviously, if you look at what we had launched in the last few quarters and few years, we launched a lot of new products, and now we are launching a lot of new services.",1
"And when we do that we need to make the adequate investments in marketing and advertising to raise the awareness of the new products and new services and that is what you're seeing for example in the guidance that we provided for the first quarter as weâre launching new services right now, and so we're making investments both in engineering and in advertising to support the new launches.",1
That will come from Bernsteinâs Toni Sacconaghi.,1
"Yes. Thank you. I think this is for Luca, and then I have a follow-up as well. If I look at your guidance, the midpoint of your guidance for revenues on a sequential basis, it's up about 36.5%. Historically, fiscal Q4 to Q1 was up 50% or more, and even last year given that iPhone is a slower growing product, you guided for revenues to be up 45% sequentially.",1
"So given the enthusiasm about the iPhone 11 launch and the new Wearables products and the new services, I guess the question is, why is your guidance not stronger for Q1 on the top line?",1
And is that sort of a reflection of conservatism given that there's a lot of uncertainty in the world and we certainly saw that last year? Or are there other forces at work that we should be considered?,1
"As I said earlier, foreign exchange is clearly a headwind for us right now. This is about $1.1 billion of negative foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis. So that is something to keep in mind.",1
"Well, you know, Shannon, we've gone through different cycles. In some cases, our revenue growth exceeds our OpEx growth. In other cases, like fiscal '19, it was the other way around. But our approach frankly is not changing over time. We want to invest in the business.",1
"We feel very good as Tim said about the iPhone, the way the new cycle has started, and we do expect an improvement in our year-over-year growth rate on iPhone. Wearables has very, very strong momentum. The portfolio of services also has incredible momentum.",1
"One thing to keep in mind as we look at this guidance range is the fact that we also contemplated the comparison to the launch of the iPad Pro, a year ago for iPad as well as the new MacBook Air that was launched during the December quarter last year.",1
"So for the iPad and Mac categories, you need to keep in mind that our launch timing is different on a year-over-year basis.",1
"Okay. Thank you for that. And then if I could follow-up, just on the bundling of Apple TV+, I guess for you, Tim, this is really the first time we've seen a significant bundling of services offering and hardware offering.",1
"And I'm wondering if you view this as kind of a strategic advantage of Apple and whether we might see more hardware plus services offerings - bundled offerings, and ultimately do you - do you ever believe that your hardware itself might be offered as a bundled service.",1
"And maybe while we're on that either you or Luca could give us the 30 second tutorial on how we should think about the deferred revenue accounting? Approximately how much of the $60 are you going to be deferring, and what's your expectation for attach rate on that? Thank you.",1
"Our primary investments during the last few years have been in the R&D space, because obviously we want to continue to innovate, improve the user experience differentiate our products.",1
"Thank you. And then, I'm curious, Luca, maybe you can talk a bit about how you think about operating expense growth. It continues to grow significantly faster than revenue. So I am just curious as to where you're targeting the incremental spend? And then, is there a point at which we might just see some leverage? Thank you.",1
"But you need to keep in mind that we contemplate a number of factors including the fact that we have family sharing as part of the service, the fact that there are multiple device purchases, the geographic availability around the world, the availability of local content at the beginning of the service, how many people do we have with payment methods on file.",1
That will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"But if you look at the number of services that have been added over the years, it's significant and people love them. And so it's really both of those. And obviously in - finally in getting more people that are enjoying things for free to - let to pay for some of the premium services. So it's sort of all three of those.",1
"Got it. And if I was just kind of go back to the variables discussion, especially as I think about Apple Watch and AirPods, is there a central way to think about what's the attach rate today to iOS devices for Apple Watch and AirPod update.",1
"I just want to understand if I think about 900 million plus iPhone installed base, what kind of penetration do you have at Wearables and how long could this one maybe as you go forward?",1
"Weâre not releasing the precise numbers of our Wearables, but it is a really nice try and get me to say that. The -- what we're seeing in terms of new adds on the Watch, I think Luca may have mentioned this in his comments is about three-quarters of the Apple Watch buyers are new to Apple Watch.",1
"And so we are still insignificantly in the build mode there, and so don't think of the penetration as anywhere near sort of a mature penetration. We got lot left there, and the AirPods just keep hitting new highs.",1
And I anticipate that will carry over to this quarter too and we are really proud to add another product out there for people wanting noise-cancelling with the AirPod Pro beginning to sell today.,1
"Thank you very much. First, Nancy, just want to send you our best wishes. We will definitely miss you. I'm sure, I agree with Luca, you've been very instrumental over the years.",1
"It's not all about quantity, but about which ones, we saw that. Also Wearables, Wearables are doing so great at a company level. They're doing even better in China. And so lots of positives there.",1
"My questions though with regard to China, and I don't know, Tim, if you can talk more about what you're seeing in China, the trends during the quarter, the reception specifically there to the iPhone, any thoughts on - you know, Hong Kong used to be a big market, there is obviously some turmoil there. So if you could provide some more in China that would be helpful? Thank you.",1
"Yes, we had a very good September, Shannon, and the lead of that is sort of the reception of iPhone 11 and 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, and so we feel really good about how we've gotten started there. As you can tell from the numbers, we've significantly improved since the beginning of the year. We've gone from minus well into the 20s to minus two last quarter.",1
"And if you looked at that in constant currency, we actually grew one. And so there is a very slight growth there. We obviously want that to be better. But we feel good about how we're doing.",1
"I think it's a combination of things that are - that have turned things around. On a macro basis, I think the trade tension is less and that clearly looks positive right now with the comments that we've been reading in the press.",1
"Secondly, the products have been extremely well received there. Third, the things that we've done from a pricing and monthly payments point of view and trade-in, getting the trade-in program up and running, all of these things have had moved the dial. And so it's sort of the sum of all of that.",1
"I would also say, it's not all about iPhone in China, the services area grew double digit. We began to see more gaming approvals in the quarter, or I should say some key gaming approvals.",1
"Let me cover the accounting issue first. Obviously, we need to make some assumptions around the take rate of our customers on the -- on Apple TV+, right. And we don't want to get into the details of that because we do those assumptions as confidential and competitively sensitive.",1
"So we use all these things to make assumptions around what the take rate is going to be. Obviously, those assumptions will possibly change over time as we get more information on how the customers behave. We haven't launched the service yet - we're going to serve - serving our customers tomorrow. So we'll see how it goes, but we take into account all these different factors.",1
"Our results for this quarter were ahead of our expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected iPhone and Services performance. As we anticipated, we launched new iPhone models in October, a few weeks later than last yearâs mid-September launch. Up to that mid-September point, customer demand for iPhone was very strong, and grew double-digits.",1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414, and financial analysts can contact Tejas Gala or me with additional questions. Tejas is at 669-227-2402, and I am at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
But I feel like we're off to a good start and the - most important of everything. The customer feedback to date has really been incredible and we're very excited for the future of the service.,1
"Great. As a follow-up if I can, trying to attack the Wearables question within the angle, what are you seeing in terms of -- I believe consumer behavior in upgrading Wearables like Apple Watch AirPods and how are you thinking about your ability to accelerate some of that replacement cycle by driving innovation?",1
"I think we, because the Watch is relatively young. We haven't seen enough upgrade cycles to really establish a pattern as yet. And as I've mentioned before, 3 out of 4 customers buying an Apple Watch currently or last quarter I should say were buying an Apple Watch for the first time. And so there is still a very, very large new to Apple Watch in this regard.",1
"I do think the upgrade market will look at larger over time, but just don't have a current view as to -- how often and so forth. On the AirPods we're anxious to see the customers for the new AirPods Pro.",1
But I would guess that one particularly in the early going will be people that have AirPods today and want to have -- also have a pair for the times that they need noise cancellation.,1
"Thank you. Samik. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone. And the numbers to the telephone replay are 888-203-1112, or 719-457-0820. Please enter confirmation code 433-1479. These replays will be available by approximately 5:00 PM Pacific Time today.",1
"And that will conclude today's conference. Again, thank you all for joining us today.",1
"Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start off with one of the new services Apple Arcade, and if you have any insights in terms of what you're seeing for engagement or retention of customers beyond the initial trial period also how your partnerships with developers progressing there. How does the pipeline look like than any early projections of what that business longer term might look like?",1
Good day everyone and welcome to the Apple Inc. Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Todayâs call is being recorded.,1
"At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn things over to Tejas Gala, Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Appleâs CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, weâll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information youâll hear during the discussion today, will consist of our forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the companyâs business, and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Appleâs most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thanks Tejas. Good afternoon and thanks for joining the call today. Back in April, I said we were in the most challenging environment in which Apple as a company has ever operated. That atmosphere of uncertainty, of resolve, of making difficult calls with limited information has not only come to define Appleâs year, but each of our lives as individuals across this country, and around the world. It has been a chapter that none of us will forget. In the face of these challenges, Apple stayed relentlessly focused on what we do best, seeing in every obstacle an opportunity to do something new, something creative, something better on behalf of our customers.",1
"Today we report a quarter and a fiscal year that reflects that effort. This quarter, Apple achieved revenue of $64.7 billion, a September quarter record, despite the anticipated absence of new iPhone availability during the quarter, and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, including closures at many of our retail locations. We also set a new all-time record for Mac and Services. Outside of iPhone, each of our product categories saw strong double digit year-over-year growth, despite supply constraints in several product categories.",1
"We're not going to give out projections on it, but I would tell you that we were really pleased with the number of people that enter the trial period. People are just coming out of the 30-day trial period in the last few days or week or so. And so it's really too early to tell what the conversion rate will be.",1
That will be from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.,1
"On the bundle question, Toni, we look at each service, and decide what's best to do for it and with TV+, we concluded that a great way to get more people to see the content would be to do this, and it would be a good gift for our users, and so that's what we're doing.",1
So if you could talk about maybe what that tells us about pricing strategy in general and perhaps that you're willing to take a little more flexible approach to drive some elasticity if you think that's going to have a positive effect?,1
"You can also see that on the other services we're not doing that. And so it's not part of a broader pattern, or although I wouldn't want to rule out for the future that we might not see another opportunity at some point in time.",1
"In terms of hardware as a service or as a bundle, if you will, there are customers today that essentially view the hardware like that because they are on upgrade plans and so forth. And so to some degree that exists today, my perspective is that we will grow in the future to larger numbers that will grow disproportionately.",1
And one of the things we are doing is trying to make it simpler and simpler for people to get on these sort of monthly financing kind of things. That's a part of what we announced with the Apple Card earlier in the call and so we are cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a recurring payment like that and the receipt of new products on some sort of standard kind of basis and we are committed to make that easier to do than perhaps it is today.,1
That will be from Chris Caso with Raymond James.,1
"Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. And Nancy, congratulations to you too, and we're going to miss you.",1
"My first question is about pricing and the effect of some of the lower price points for iPhone 11 as compared to last year. And it looked like margins and revenues did well on that, and also followed some price adjustments you made in emerging markets last year, and obviously we've seen some improvement in China as well.",1
"Yes, Chris, I think that the price moves we've made have been smart and well received and do show a level of elasticity, but the most important thing by far is the product. And I think we've got the best line-up we've ever had in the customer response to the product and what the product does for them is really incredible.",1
"Thank you, Chris. Could we have the next question please?",1
"And photos I am getting from many users around the world are just incredible that people are taking. And so I think it's product first, and then prices sort of falls out of that, and we did decide to be more aggressive. And looking at the results in the early going, I think it was the right call.",1
"In terms of emerging markets we picked sort of locally relevant prices, and in some cases where the dollar had become stronger, we took an exchange rate that would have reflected a while back, instead of the current exchange rate.",1
"And in other words, we tried to stay as close as we could to a local price point that we knew was effective for that particular market. And those in addition to the U.S. price that has gotten more of a discussion had been extremely well received.",1
"Thank you. As a follow-on, perhaps you could talk about the potential for some of the tariffs that are upcoming what -- do you have a view of what potential impact that could have going forward and how Apple is looking to address it? Will you need to adjust your own pricing if in fact the tariffs are imposed?",1
"We are paying some tariffs today as you know, some that went into effect pre-September, and some others that went into effect in September. So we are paying some that's been comprehended. But in general, my view is very positive in terms of how things are going, and that positive view is obviously factored in our guidance as well.",1
"And just the tone I think has changed significantly and I have long thought that it was in both countries, best interests to get to an agreement that may be initially doesn't solve everything but solves some things that each party may want and get to a better place than where we're at and I'm hopeful that that's where we're headed.",1
"Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just want to start off with the iPhone lineup here, particularly as you mentioned, the carrier subsidies that you see mixed optimistic about iPhone sales. I think just looking at some other factors here. Earlier in the year, you had mentioned that iPhone sales was seeing an uptake with stimulus checks going out to consumers helping in the consumer spending overall here in the US. So as we see some delays here on that front, are you seeing anything change on the consumer spending side as a macro impacting? How you think about iPhone sales, particularly with -- even with the new product lineup? And I have a follow up. Thank you.",1
"It's prior to mid September, we were seeing double digit growth in customer demand on iPhone. So there's a lot of momentum there. And there is a lot of momentum even much more so now given the launch of the 12 Pro and the iPhone 12. If you're asking whether it could have been even more with a different macro spending environment? I believe the answer to be yes. But you can't run the experiment. And so I don't know for sure. But I suspect that just the COVID in general take something off from a worldwide economic point of view.",1
"Perfect. And if can just follow up just following up on that COVID discussion. We are potentially here looking at a second wave, right. And I think all companies are trying to prepare for that which you discussed as well in your prepared remarks. But if you can share any kind of thoughts about how you're preparing in relation to either inventory levels, or sourcing from the supply chain, to prepare for any potential disruption, like we had earlier this year?",1
"Great. Thank you, guys. And I just have two quick questions, one big picture, theoretical. So, you covered the supply chain in pretty extensive detail on the call. But maybe just a bigger picture on how youâre thinking about it philosophically given what you just sort of went through over the last 12 to 8 months. So, what I mean by that, is there sort of a recalibration needed or an adjustment around your supply chain philosophy either from a partner perspective or maybe a regional perspective? And how do you think about the current infrastructure and its ability to sort of rebound and sort of handle sort of these disruptions that seem to crop up from time to time? And then, I have a follow-up.",1
"Yes. Look, maybe I can take both of those. Channel inventory, as you would expect in a constrained environment, the iPhone channel inventory ended below the targeted range and is currently below it. And so, thatâs that.",1
"In terms of the blurring of demand, we look at -- Katy, we look at a number of different data points. We look at demand across our online store, demand in retail. We look through to back orders on the carrier channels, the ones that do take back orders there. We look at channel orders as well. And so, we have a number of different data points that we use to conclude how strong demand is. And we feel very, very good about where demand is right now. And weâre working feverishly on the supply side of that.",1
"And Tim, as a follow-up. We recently surveyed 4,000 consumers in the U.S. and China, and the feedback is most of them donât want to pay for apps or services direct with the developer. They value the security, privacy, ease of transactions with the App Store. So, how do you think about balancing the regulators push for more choice with a customer base thatâs happy with the existing experience? And just as a follow-on to that, how are you and Luca thinking about the potential impact of services revenue growth rate as some of the changes to the App Store go into effect?",1
"Katy, the main thing that weâre focused on, on the App Store is to keep our focus on privacy and security. And so, these are the two major tenets that have produced over the years a very trusted environment where consumers and developers come together and consumers can trust the developers on the developers and the apps or what they say they are and the developers get a huge audience to sell their software to. And so, thatâs sort of number one on our list. Everything else is a distant second.",1
"And so, what weâre doing is working to explain the decisions that weâve made that are key to keeping the privacy and security there, which is to not have sideloading and not have alternate ways on the iPhone, where it opens up the iPhone to unreviewed apps and also get by the privacy restrictions that we put on the App Store. And so, weâre very, very focused in discussing the privacy and security elements of the App Store with the regulators and legislators.",1
Weâll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS.,1
"Yes. I donât see a fundamental error that weâve made, if thatâs what youâre picking out, in terms of creating the environment that weâre in. It was created for a number of reasons. The pandemic came along. Some people in the industry and some people outside the industry thought that the pandemic would reduce demand. They pulled their orders down. Things reset. And what really happened was demand went up and went up even more than a straight trend would predict.",1
Weâll hear next from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"And so, the industry is working through that now. Iâm making it little overly simplistic. Thereâs some other things like yields and things like that that are happening as well. But, those things are mainly manageable in the course of time. And so, what weâre doing is working with our partners on making sure that they have supply that we need and making sure that our demand statements are accurate as we see them and so forth. And at the same time, we are reducing our lead times and cycle times, so that when you get a chip off a fab that as quickly as possible, itâs in a product and shipping and also helping the fab partners increase their yields. And so, those things are things that weâre doing. We also support the CHIPS Act and investment there to put more investment in the ground. And so, weâre spending some time advocating for the CHIPS Act as well.",1
"Great. And thatâs helpful. And I didnât mean to implicate that you guys had messed up, just maybe came off that way. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. When you think about purchasing devices ratably, you touched on that earlier. But maybe can you just touch on the partnerships that you have with carriers and the support that they have given you over the last couple of years. Now, itâs been a key component of your success, the tight relationships that you have globally. Do you think sort of this business model, as itâs currently sort of put together globally, is sort of a permanent structure, meaning carriers are going to be integral part of driving demand for iPhones, or is there a sense that maybe itâs a little bit more transitory depending on the part of the cycle that weâre in?",1
"I think that 5G has provided a once in a decade kind of upgrade potential, and itâs a multiyear kind of thing. Itâs not a one year and done. And I think that weâre motivated there. The carrier is motivated there. We have mutual interest and the customer benefits hugely from getting a new 5G phone that has 5G and a number of other features in it, too. And so, I think everybody is aligned on purpose.",1
"The model that you paint is -- I wouldnât call it a global model because there are different variations around the world depending upon the country. But, in general, I think that the marriage, if you will, or partnership between Apple and the carrier channel has never been stronger and that itâs on very solid footing.",1
"So, weâll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.",1
"I had two of them, too. And Tim, I will give you a reprieve from the supply chain questions. I had two on services. The first one is on your new ATT, the ad tracking transparency feature, and all the headlines that have gone recently, Iâm kind of curious. The feedback youâve seen or received from your advertisers and users and how it has also impacted search ads your own ad business. Can you let us know the feedback? And then, I have a follow-up.",1
"Thank you. Given the supply chain is blurring the demand picture for iPhone 13, what data points can you share that help investors understand whether demand is tracking to a product cycle that is flat, growing or down from the very strong iPhone 12? And maybe on that front, Luca, you can also comment on where you exited the quarter from a channel inventory standpoint for iPhone relative to a normal product cycle? And then, Iâve got a follow-up.",1
"Well, as you know, typically, obviously with December being the holiday season, we do get leverage, as you say. But, itâs also the period of the year where we launch a lot of new products. And as you know, we launch essentially in every product category. We launch new products. Demand is very strong. But as you know, when we launch these new products, we tend to have higher cost structures at the beginning of the cycle. And so, thatâs what balances this out. Obviously, from a year-over-year standpoint, itâs actually a significant expansion, right? Because when you look at what we did a year ago in the December quarter, 39.8%, this clearly indicates a significant expansion.",1
"Got it. Got it, Tim. And thatâs a very fair characterization. Thank you for that. And then, as a quick follow-up, Iâm just kind of curious, on the mobile gaming in your App Store, there have been some recent actions by certain governments to limit game time. Kind of curious how that affects your App Store business in those geographies. And is there a way you can quantify that, or is it too immaterial at this point?",1
"Sure. If you look at Q4 for a moment, we had about $6 billion in supply constraints, and it affected the iPhone, the iPad and the Mac. We had -- there were two causes of them for Q4. One was the chip shortages that youâve heard a lot about from many different companies through the industry. And the second was COVID-related manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia. The second of those, the COVID disruptions, have improved materially across October to where we currently are. And so, for this quarter, we think that the primary cause of supply-chain-related shortages will be the chip shortage. It will affect -- it is affecting, I should say, pretty much most of our products currently and -- but from a demand point of view, demand is very robust. And so, part of this is the demand also is very strong. But we believe that by the time we finish the quarter that the constraints will be larger than the $6 billion that we experienced in Q4.",1
"As we move ahead into the December quarter, Iâd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.",1
"As we mentioned earlier, during the September quarter, supply constraints impacted our revenue by around $6 billion. We estimate the impact from supply constraints will be larger during the December quarter. Despite this challenge, we are seeing high demands for our products and expect to achieve very solid year-over-year revenue growth and to set a new revenue record during the December quarter.",1
"We expect revenue for each product category to grow on a year-over-year basis, except for iPad, which we expect to decline year-over-year due to supply constraints. For services, we expect our growth rate to decelerate from the September quarter but to remain strong. We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $12.4 billion and $12.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.",1
"Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on November 11, 2021, to shareholders of record as of November 8, 2021.",1
Thank you. Our first question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research.,1
"Thank you very much. Tim, Iâm wondering, can you talk a bit more about specific supply chain issues you saw and how youâve seen improvements I think during the current quarter, and how we should think about what products do you expect to see most impacted going forward? Just any more color you can give us on whatâs going on out there because clearly, this is hitting everyone.",1
"Okay, great. So, youâll sort of push forward in the next quarter as well. Can you -- just a different question because Iâm curious, youâre starting to sell more and more things on a ratable basis. And how are you thinking about that? I mean, you have the new Macs and that we keep seeing. You can buy for a monthly charge in that. How do you think thatâs driving sales? And how should we think about percent maybe of the portfolio thatâs now available? And I donât know if you want to tell us how much revenue is now under a recurring nature, but it definitely seems as youâre shifting more and more to maybe sort of a bundled sale or offering from a consumer standpoint where you just pay one price every month and you get all of your Apple devices and Apple services. Thank you.",1
"Got it. And then, Luca, if I may ask you a question on gross margins for December, youâre essentially guiding gross margins to be flat to maybe down a little bit versus sort of September. Maybe just touch about it. So, I think historically, I would have expected gross margins to be up in December, given how much revenue leverage you end up with. So maybe, what are the puts and takes on gross margins that are resulting in a more flattish guide versus historical seasonality?",1
"Yes. The first product, Shannon, that really sold on a monthly basis was iPhone. And that began to happen in the U.S., as an example, shortly after the subsidy kind of world changed markedly. And so, I would say that predominantly, the mode of buying an iPhone in the United States is on a monthly kind of plan today. For the balance of the products, still the most popular would be buying them outright. But, we are seeing more and more demand for monthly payments. And so, we want to give the customer what they want. And so, you will see us do more and more things like that that will meet the customer where -- and provide the price that they want -- in a way that they want to pay for it. I donât know the percentage of products that are sold that way today, but it is increasing.",1
We will hear next from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.,1
"Perfect. Thanks a lot, and good afternoon, everyone. I have two as well. I guess, when I think about the supply chain headwinds, and youâre talking about $6 billion in September, getting bigger in December. Tim, I would love to understand how do you guys comfort that this is really a demand thatâs getting deferred versus potentially getting destroyed at least somewhere else. And if you think about the supply chain bottlenecks -- you were the COO. You managed a lot of the stuff. Do you feel comfortable that sort of peaks in December and alleviates it from there, or what does the trajectory look like for improvement?",1
"Yes. What I feel comfortable on is I feel like weâve made great progress on the COVID-related disruptions, and that happened across the month of October, and weâre in a materially better position today. It is difficult to predict COVID. And so, Iâm not going to predict where it goes. But I can just tell you that as of today, weâre in a materially better position than we were in September and in the first several weeks of October.",1
"In terms of the chip shortage, the chip shortage is happening on legacy nodes. Primarily, we buy leading edge nodes, and weâre not having issues on leading edge nodes. But on legacy nodes, we compete with many different companies for supply. And itâs difficult to forecast when those things will balance because youâd have to know how kind of -- how the economy is going to be in â22 and the accuracy of everyone elseâs demand projections.",1
"And so, I donât feel comfortable in making a prediction. I think, it would be subject to too much inaccuracy. But, I do feel very comfortable with our operational team. I think, weâve got a world-class one. And Iâm sure theyâre doing everything they can do to collapse cycle times and improve yields and do all the things that you can do in addition to fundamental capacity investment to remedy the situation.",1
"The feedback from customers is overwhelmingly positive. Customers appreciate having the option of whether they want to be tracked or not. And so, thereâs an outpouring of customer satisfaction there on the customer side. And the reason that we did this is that -- as you know, if you followed us for a while, we believe strongly that privacy is a basic human right and we believe that for decades, not just in the last year or so. And weâve historically rolled out more and more features over time for -- to place the decision of whether to share data and what data to share in the hands of the user where we believe that it belongs. We donât think thatâs Appleâs role to decide, and we donât think thatâs another companyâs role to decide but rather the individual who owns the data itself. And so, thatâs our motivation there. Thereâs no other motivation.",1
You mean limiting the time on games. Is that what youâre getting at?,1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $191 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $6.5 billion of new term debt, retired $1.3 billion of term debt and decreased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $125 billion. As a result, net cash was $66 billion at the end of the quarter as we continue to make progress towards our goal of net cash neutral over time.",1
Weâll hear next from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.,1
Weâll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.,1
"Yes. Hey, guys, first of all, a great job managing to the supply constraints. Itâs obviously affecting everybody. So congratulations. And then Tim, one for you, a strategic question. When Apple thinks about strategic areas that as a company that we own, for example, software is a high priority, but youâre also one of the largest semiconductor companies if the company would stand alone. So, curious about the kind of input that -- thinking that goes into owning some piece of technology. For example, when we survey people, they say batteries and screens are very important. So, why doesnât Apple -- for example, what causes Apple from looking at areas like that?",1
"We look at ones where we believe we can make a substantial difference and have a level of differentiation. And so, weâve put a lot of energy in the silicon space because we have felt that we could design and develop products that we could not if we were in the -- just buying whatâs available on the commercial market. And as you can see, more recently, we made that call on the Mac as well and have shifted to our own chips there. And so, it really depends on whether we see a way to do something thatâs differentiated or not. And I wouldnât want to rule anything out. Itâs more of whether or not we see our way clear to doing something that is materially better. We feel like weâve done that in the chip area.",1
"And then, Iâve got one for Luca. I want to go back to a question that Amit asked earlier in the call about the gross margin. So, when I look at the September quarter, services obviously grew much faster than the product business, margin was down and same thing for December. But I think youâre effectively saying that thereâs a lot of new product launches. Would that not go into OpEx, for example, marketing, et cetera, as opposed to COGS, or is there something that maybe needs to be clarified here?",1
"There is -- certainly, obviously, that we have launch expenses in marketing and advertising, of course, when we launch new products. But, the reality, what happens, we always make our products better and which means adding new technology and new features to the product. So, typically, when you move from one generation of products to the next one, the cost structures tend to be higher, particularly at the beginning of the cycle. And so, when you make that transition, there is always some level of margin compression from the transition to a new product.",1
"The other aspect that you need to think about is the fact that the December quarter is the holiday season, and so the percentage of products business that we have in the holiday quarter is higher than what we have in the September quarter, for example. And therefore, as you know, because the services margins are higher than the products margin. Thereâs also a mix between the products and services business that plays into the gross margins for the Company, right? And thatâs what you see as you move sequentially from September to December.",1
"I had a question about -- broadly about pricing of new products. This year, Apple launched the iPhone 13 at a slightly lower price than where the 12 was launched last year in China. Can you maybe help us think through what are some of the things that you look at in deciding that? And is that an action that you could take more broadly in other regions? And I have a follow-up.",1
"Okay. As a follow-up, could you speak to iPhone mix? And one of the things we noted is that the delivery time for all iPhones are a bit long because of the constraints. Theyâre a bit longer on the Pro and the Max. Is that a function of supply or demand or perhaps both? And again, I would imagine you have a little better handle on that this year, given that all the phones were launched at the same time.",1
"We look at a variety of things, including our costs, including competition, including local conditions and exchange rates and a number of different things. And so, thereâs not a -- thereâs no formula for determining it. Itâs done by a level of judgment looking at a number of different points -- data points. And we do that region by region.",1
"But, we shouldnât, as investors, think of that as something structural that you intend to use to flex demand curves more globally?",1
"Itâs something weâve always done. And so, itâs not something that is new to this year and this cycle.",1
"Okay. And as a follow-up, youâve introduced a lot of new services over the past few years, and these have become a much more important part of the Apple story. Can you maybe share either some metrics on some of the new Services like TV+ in terms of paid subs? And how are you measuring the success of these investments?",1
"Well, we look at a number of things internally that we donât share externally. And so, you can bet that weâre looking at subs and ARPUs and conversions and churn and all of the normal things you would look at with a subscription business. But, weâre not going to get into sharing those on an individual service basis. What weâre trying to do is give you visibility to the aggregate number of subscriptions that weâve had, which Luca covered earlier with the 745 million across both Apple branded and third party. And so, weâre giving you an aggregated view of it instead of the -- at the individual service level. But, you can bet that weâre managing it at the individual service level.",1
"Thank you, Wamsi. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcast as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. The numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. Please enter confirmation code 7141415. These replays will be available by approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.",1
"Yes. Itâs really too early to make comments on mix at this point because it has been -- we have been in a constrained environment. So, the mix becomes more obvious, once supply and demand are balanced.",1
"I think there are some products that people buy as gifts that if itâs not there that itâs perishable. But I think that we have a lot of products as well that people will wait for and would expect those to be captured in a different time period. So, itâs a combination for this certain quarter, the holiday quarter, I believe.",1
"Yes, exactly. Like youâre trying to decide to limit game time and things like that.",1
Weâll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup.,1
"Itâs very difficult to measure. Yes, with the policy that youâre talking about for those people that donât know is thereâs a policy to restrict kids below a certain age to -- I think itâs one hour on Friday, Saturday, Sunday each. And itâs very difficult to see the impact of it on the App Store at this point.",1
Weâll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.,1
"I guess, Tim, I wanted to first start off on your comment about strong demand across products. And just specific to iPhone 13, if you can give us a bit more insight about what are you seeing in terms of intent, in terms of either upgrades from the installed base or even switchers rate too, if you can compare to iPhone 12 because some of the feedback we are getting is, for example, like strong switching activity in China. So just wondering if you can get a bit more granular there in terms of the -- whatâs driving the demand and who is it coming from. And then, I have a follow-up, please.",1
"Itâs so early to talk about iPhone 13 because itâs only been on the market for less than 30 days now. What I can tell you is going into the cycle, if you look at our results from last quarter, we grew on upgraders and switchers in the double digits. And so, both were very meaningful for the iPhone results last quarter. And so, thereâs significant momentum in iPhone. And I would clearly characterize the demand that weâre seeing currently as robust, as you can tell from the -- some of the quotes that weâre quoting on the online store.",1
"Okay. And as a follow-up, I guess, back to the supply chain but I wanted to just ask more relative to cost implications there. And what weâre hearing is not only delays but also component cost going up. So, as we look through -- as I think about this upcoming cycle, how are you looking to manage component cost related headwinds? And is that something youâre seeing coming through the supply chain? Thank you.",1
"Weâve put our current thoughts in the gross margin guidance that we gave you, the 41.5% to 42.5%. I would tell you that we are seeing a significant increase in freight costs. And I would assume that that is pretty consistent across different companies. And so, weâre clearly seeing some inflation there.",1
"Thank you. And Iâll ask both my questions at the same time. Probably the first one is for Tim. On the services revenue, much better than expected. Can you give us some details about what drove that? Was it Apple Stores more open, so more AppleCare or more Apple One or Arcade or TV or Fitness?",1
"For my first question, itâs a question about your ability to recapture sales that you werenât able to fill in Q4, Q1 and Q2. And you have some experience in that from last year when the iPhone, not all the models launched at the same time and some are late, and you did recapture some of that as you went past the holidays. Do you think that we should expect similar behavior this year? And then, with that also is, will all product categories behave similarly? Meaning that are the some product categories where if you missed the holidays, you just missed the sale.",1
"And then, probably for Luca on supply chain, when you mentioned supply chain headwind is going to get worse and you mentioned $6 billion this quarter, thereâs two ways to think about your terminology of worse. Is it the delta from $2 billion that you identified three months ago that went to $6 billion, so therefore, the delta of $4 billion gets worse, or are you just saying -- and therefore, itâs above $10 billion for December quarter. Are you just saying it just gets higher than the $6 billion that you just identified earlier in the call?",1
"Jim, Iâm going to take the second question that you asked, and Luca could take the first one on services, just in the reverse of the way you coined it. On the supply constraints, what weâre saying is that the amount of -- the nominal amount of supply constraints for Q1, we estimate to be larger than $6 billion. And so, itâs important to know that weâre getting a lot more supply in Q1 than we had in Q4, obviously, because our sequential growth is significant. And we have very solid growth year-over-year. And so, the amount of supply is growing dramatically. Itâs just that the demand is so robust that we envision having supply constraints for the quarter.",1
"And Jim, on services, the 26% growth rate that we had was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. And it was really across the board. Itâs difficult to single out a specific area because we set all-time records on cloud. We set all-time records across the board, AppleCare, Music, video, advertising, payment services, the App Store was a September quarter, right? So, it was strong across the board.",1
"When we look at the services business, we always think about some fundamental factors that allow us to have good visibility over the sustainability of the business, right? The fact that the installed base continues to grow, thatâs obviously a positive. The fact that the number of people that are actually paying on the platform continues to grow double digits. And so, that obviously increases our opportunity. The number of subscriptions that we have on the platform, we mentioned during the call, 745 million paid subs right now. Itâs an increase of 160 million versus just 12 months ago, right?",1
"And obviously, the fact that we continue to launch new services, new offerings within the services that we already have, new features, that obviously gives us a lot of momentum going forward. Weâre very fortunate we have a very -- now itâs a very large business, $68 billion in the last 12 months and very diversified. We sell a lot of different services and our customers seem to really enjoy the experience that they have on the platform.",1
Weâll take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.,1
"As our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, we were also able to return $24 billion to shareholders during the September quarter. This included $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20 billion through open market repurchases of 137 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 5 million shares in the final settlement of our 17th ASR.",1
"Fiscal â21 was not only a big year for services but for our entire company. During the past 12 months, we grew our business by 33% or $91 billion, reaching nearly $366 billion of revenue with record level performance across the board. Every product category and every geographic segment set a new annual revenue record and was up at least 20% over fiscal 2020.",1
"Well, we're doing everything we can do. But we're prioritizing safety first, obviously. And so with our stores as an example, we've come up with a new concept that puts an essentially turns the store into an express storefront. And we've implemented that in a number of places where we believe that helps from the safety of our employee and the safety of the customer's point of view, but still allows for an interaction to take place. And so we've also put a lot more people on the phones because a lot more people are reaching out to us in that way. And of course, the online store has stayed up and running through the whole of this. I think if you take some of those, the channel is doing some similar things and then some different things as well.",1
"Thanks, Tejas, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today.",1
"And again, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for joining us today.",1
"Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q4 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Todayâs call is being recorded.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us.",1
"Speaking today first is Appleâs CEO, Tim Cook; and heâll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, weâll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information youâll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the Companyâs business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Appleâs most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.",1
Iâd like to now turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.,1
"A year ago, I spoke to you about the atmosphere of uncertainty in which we were living and the way it had come to define our daily experience, both as people and as a company. Today, much has changed, profoundly so. And while we are still living through unprecedented times, we are encouraged by progress around the world.",1
"I don't want to speak for our carrier partners that would be up to them to talk about their plans. Generally, I think it's to the vast, vast majority of carriers around the world to their interest to move customers to 5G. And I think it's in the customer's interest to move to 5G and obviously, we like that as well. And so I think you have a situation where everyone's whoring in the same direction. And that's a very different kind of situation than normally we would have. And so it is one of the things as I alluded to earlier that makes me very bullish, only one, the other things are very important to the size of the install base, the product lineup, these things are critically important as well.",1
"Iâm grateful to our teams who have stayed resolutely focused on our customers and the pursuit of innovation on their behalf. Weâve aimed to help our customers navigate the world as it is while empowering them to create the world as it can be. Whether itâs public health workers managing vaccination campaigns on iPhone or students returning to classrooms full of iPads or family staying connected over FaceTime, it is an honor to know that what we make matters and to see that reflected in the world and in our performance.",1
"This fiscal year, we reported $366 billion of revenue, which represents 33% annual growth. We also achieved more than 20% growth across all of our product categories and in every geographic segment. And today, Apple is reporting another very strong quarter. Demand was very robust, and we set a new September quarter record of $83.4 billion, up 29% from last year and in line with what we discussed on our last call, despite larger-than-expected supply constraints.",1
"We estimate these constraints had around a $6 billion revenue dollar impact, driven primarily by industry-wide silicon shortages and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions. Even so, we set an all-time record for Mac and quarterly records for iPhone, iPad, Wearables, Home and Accessories, representing 30% year-over-year growth in products. Our services business performed better than we expected, where we hit an all-time record of $18.3 billion and grew 26% year-over-year.",1
"And we set quarterly records in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth across the board. During fiscal 2021, we earned nearly one-third of our revenue from emerging markets and doubled our business in India and Vietnam. We are optimistic about the future, especially as we see strong demand for our new products.",1
"At the end of the September quarter, we introduced our iPhone 13 lineup as well as the Apple Watch Series 7, iPad and iPad mini, all of which represents significant advances. The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini, alongside the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, are setting a new standard with their superfast performance, advanced camera systems, longer battery life and brilliant Super Retina displays.",1
"Customers are loving the ninth generation iPad, which features a beautifully sharp display and twice the storage of the previous generation, as well as the new iPad mini, with its ultra portable design and impressive speed and performance. And weâve been thrilled with the reviews that Apple Watch Series 7 has earned for its larger display, faster charging and refined design.",1
"Thank you, Chris. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. The numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457- 0820, please enter confirmation code 9501153. These replays will be available by approximately 5 PM Pacific time today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414; financial analysts can contact me with additional questions at 669-227-2402. Thank you again for joining us.",1
"As a follow up you mentioned, some of the carrier incentives we've seen here in the US. And if you could provide some more color about that, about what you're seeing now. And obviously, as we went through, years ago, the incentive from carriers were a lot larger. Is this mark some shift in the approach of carriers as we're moving into 5G? What's the extent of the permanence of some of these incentives? And then, as 5G rolls out around the world and into other geographies, is this something we should expect that as either they try to protect from switchers or kind of promote the 5G networks will see a higher prevalence of incentives and carriers as we go forward?",1
"We also announced our all-new AirPods that feature spatial audio and industry-leading sound, longer battery life and an all-new design. For the home, we added three new colors to our HomePod mini lineup, which offers seamless integration across Appleâs products and services. We also announced a new subscription tier to Apple Music called Apple Music Voice, which offers subscribers access to the services catalog of 90 million songs all through the power of Siri.",1
That will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.,1
"And so I think everybody to the best of their ability is putting in contingency plans and finding a way to adapt to the environment. But it is difficult to call and there's a level of uncertainty in it, obviously. And that's what Luca was referring to earlier.",1
That will come from Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company.,1
"Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them, first on palooka. I understand you don't want to give color on gross margin by products or segments. But Luca you mentioned growth margin should be similar in December versus September. And so it should grow double digit, there's a general view that on the iPhone side, the bond cost would be headwind for gross margin, but carrier subsidies would be attainment. So I'm kind of curious, how should we think about the different, like gross margin levels into December quarter? And I have a follow up.",1
"Yes. And so typically during the December quarter, we have positive factors because we have the typical seasonal leverage, right, sequentially as we go from September to the holiday season. And we also have an improved mix between products, particularly this year, as we've launched the new iPhone, at the same time, we shouldn't forget that we have launched a lot of new products. During the last several weeks, we launched four new models of iPhone; we launch new models of Apple watch new, models of iPads. And so, clearly every time we launch a new product, the cost structure is higher. And so that is going to be the other side of the coin. So but we think that those two things should balance out and again, as I was saying earlier, and we are accomplishing this while delivering a lot of new technologies, a lot of new features to our customers. This time for an exchange is not a factor and that's something that is a bit different from the past. So but that those are the pluses and minuses.",1
"Got it. Definitely helpful, Luca. And then a follow up for Tim. Tim, I kind of surprised you didn't say a lot about the payments ecosystem in this prepared comments kind of curious to find out from your advantage point, how you think of your whole payments ecosystem including Apple Card, Apple Pay, Apple Cash; now you're disaggregating the whole FinTech environment.",1
"Thanks for the question. There's just a limited number of things I can talk about is kind of a reason I didn't talk about it. We continue to be very enthusiastic about the whole Payment Services area. Apple Card is doing well. And Apple Pay is doing exceptionally well. As you can imagine in this environment, people are less want to hand over a card. So this contactless payment has taken on a different level of adoption in it that I think will never go back. The US has been lagging a bit in contactless payment. And I think that the pandemic may well get put the US on a different trajectory there. And so we are very bullish about this area and view that there are there are more things that Apple can do in this space. And in so it's an area of great interest to us.",1
"Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about the supply chain. Given your latest start from manufacturing to the flagship phone line of this year, do you think that supply will be able to meet demand through the end of the calendar? Are there any component shortages that you're seeing? Or are there any actions that you can take to increase weekly output versus last year? Thanks.",1
"Well, I the iPhone 12 family start at $699. In many places, because you can get in the deals that people are really paying are very different than that, because a lot of people, particularly in this country, but also in several other countries in the world connect to a carrier plan. And of course, those offers are much more aggressive. And so the price that our customers paying is probably the most important one. The iPhone 12 is at $799. And so I think what you're saying is there's a $200 difference there. But I would guess that people are viewing it more as a $300 difference between the 12 Mini and the 12 Pro. And so we'll see what the mix turns out. Right now we have no data other than 12 and 12. Pro, we like the data on the 12 Mini and the Pro Max, because we're not taking orders yet. But what we try to always do in pricing is give the customer a great value. And I feel like we really did that this year. And that's despite, as was mentioned earlier, all of the extra features that we placed into the phones, including 5G.",1
"Yes, Kyle, I don't know what you're talking about iPhone in particular. But if you look at iPhone, we are constrained today. And that's not a surprise where at the front end of the ramp, if you will, and how long we will be supply constrained, it's hard to predict. I mean, we haven't taken orders yet for the iPhone 12 Mini or the Pro Max either. And so those are coming in. So we shall see. But right now we are supply constrained, we are also supply constrained for avoidance of any confusion where supply constrained on Mac, we are supply constrained on iPad. And we're supply constrained on some Apple watches as well. And so we have a fair number of areas right now of focus, and we're working really, really hard to remedy those as quickly as we can. But at this point, I can't estimate when we'll be out of that.",1
"Okay, great. Thanks a lot. And then switching to Mac and iPad. How do you think about the durability of the strength you've seen there with Mac and iPad? Is there any potential for stronger than seasonal pullback after the strong back to school season and holiday season? And these supply constraints make it feel like there's a good chance for continuation of the strong demand trends and in flow through of that. What do we think about the seasonality into December and March quarter being more positive in seasonal or less positive in seasonal? Thanks.",1
"Yes, we placed our thoughts in the color that Luca provided when he said that all products excluding iPhone, all products and services excluding iPhone or all products, rather excluding iPhone would grow in the double digits. And so we continue to be bullish on what Mac and iPad can do. I think the moves that have taken place to remote learning and remote work are not going to go back to normal, normal will become something different. Because I think people are learning that there are aspects of this that work well. And so I don't believe that we're going to go back to where we were. And I think that means that iPads and Macs are even more important in those environments. The growth in both of these last quarter were phenomenal as you can tell from your from datasheet with Mac at 29 and iPad at 46.",1
"These are tremendous numbers and as Luca said the September quarter was the all time high for Mac in the history of the company, and by not by little bit by $1.6 billion. And so it was a substantial difference that we did have aggressive promotion for college students that were going back to going back to school. And so that invariably part of it. But I think the other part of it during the remote work thing is not something that's going to snap back to the way it used to be anytime soon.",1
That will come from Chris Caso with Raymond James.,1
"Yes, thank you. I guess first question is on iPhone pricing. And there was some changes in the iPhone price back this year, the iPhone, the price point for iPhone 12 moves up a bit, I guess the difference the gap between 12 and 12 Pro is smaller. And I guess that's after you made some adjustments years prior where the price point came down a bit? Can you talk through the thought process behind that and the potential implications for either unit out elasticity or blended ASP as a result of the price changes?",1
"And just last week, we introduced the completely reimagined MacBook Pro powered by the extraordinary M1 PRO and M1 Max chips. These are our most powerful notebooks ever with game-changing performance and battery life, and the worldâs best notebook display. We think customers are going to love MacBook Pro, whether theyâre editing video in Final Cut Pro or making music in Logic Pro and so much more. Theyâll be able to do things never before possible on a notebook.",1
"Across the board, teams at Apple continue to drive unmatched innovation through the seamlessly integrated hardware, software experience weâve long prided ourselves on. iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 have created more ways than ever to stay productive, whether choosing Focus to avoid distractions or Quick Note to capture a thought. macOS Monterey offers new ways to connect with friends and family, get more done and work fluidly across Apple devices. And watchOS 8 has made Apple Watch even more powerful and more ways than ever to stay active and to track your health on the go.",1
"First, our installed base continues to grow and reached an all-time high across each geographic segment. Next, we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. The number of paid accounts on our digital content stores grew double digits and reached a new all-time high during the September quarter in each geographic segment. Also, paid subscriptions continued to show very strong growth. We now have more than 745 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 160 million from last year and nearly 5 times the number of paid subscriptions we had less than five years ago. And finally, as Tim mentioned earlier, weâre adding new services that we think our customers will love. And we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services offerings.",1
"We also grew double digits in each geographic segment, setting September quarter records in both, developed and emerging markets. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone, and our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high.",1
"We also reached new Q4 records in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth in each one of them. And it was a record September quarter for both, products and services. On the product side, revenue was $65.1 billion, up 30% over a year ago as we experienced better-than-expected demand for our products, despite supply constraints that we estimated at around $6 billion.",1
"We grew in each of our product categories with an all-time record for Mac and September quarter records for iPhone, for iPad and for Wearables, Home and Accessories. This level of sales performance, combined with the unmatched loyalty of our customers and the strength of our ecosystem, drove our installed base of active devices to a new all-time record.",1
"Our services set an all-time revenue record of $18.3 billion, up 26% over a year ago, with September quarter records in every geographic segment and in every services category.",1
"Company gross margin was 42.2%, down 110 basis points from last quarter, due to higher costs and a different mix of products, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 34.3%, down 170 basis points sequentially as higher cost structures were partially offset by leverage and mix. Services gross margin was 70.5%, up 70 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix.",1
"Net income of $20.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.24, both grew over 60% year-over-year and were September quarter records.",1
"Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 47% year-over-year and set a September quarter record of $38.9 billion, despite supply constraints as customer demand was very strong. The iPhone 12 family continued to perform very well, and we are seeing enthusiastic customer response to the launch of our iPhone 13 family.",1
"For Mac, we set an all-time revenue record of $9.2 billion, despite supply constraints, driven by strong demand for our M1-powered MacBook Air. In fact, our last five quarters for Mac have been the best five quarters ever for the category.",1
"With that, Iâll hand it over to Luca for a deeper dive on our performance this quarter. Luca?",1
"iPad performance was also strong with a September quarter revenue record of $8.3 billion, up 21%, in spite of significant supply constraints as customer demand for the iPad Pro also powered by M1 was very strong.",1
"For both, Mac and iPad, we continue to see a combination of high levels of customer satisfaction and first-time buyers. Around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product. And in the most recent surveys of U.S. consumers from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 97% for both, Mac and iPad.",1
"Our continued investment in iPad and Mac is taking computing to the next level. We have redesigned and reengineered both products to provide customers an unmatched experience, which resulted in record fiscal years for both categories. We are carrying this momentum also in the enterprise market. For example, SAP has already deployed Macs to tens of thousands of their employees to date. Following the launch of our new M1 MacBook Pro last week, SAP is planning to add it to the growing list of M1 Mac offerings available to their global workforce.",1
"Another example is Franceâs national railway company, SNCF, which equips all train drivers with iPads to manage their entire daily workflow and train operations, helping to lower energy and maintenance costs. In fact, the iPads have been so well received that 90% of the drivers choose to purchase them for personal use at the end of the corporate device refresh cycle.",1
"Next, Wearables, Home and Accessories set a new September quarter record of $8.8 billion. We continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category, which we believe improve the overall customer experience and showcase the integration between our products and services. Apple Watch, AirPods and HomePod mini are powerful devices in their own right, but paired with our other products, software and services, they create unique experiences, like switching audio seamlessly between devices on your AirPods.",1
"Turning to services. As I mentioned, we reached an all-time revenue record of $18.3 billion with all-time records for cloud services, music, video, advertising, AppleCare and payment services and a September quarter record for the App Store. Our continued investment and strong execution in services has helped us deliver a record $68 billion in revenue during fiscal 2021, nearly tripling this category in six years. These impressive results reflect the positive momentum we are seeing on many fronts.",1
"We are pleased to report very strong financial results for the September quarter, capping a record-setting fiscal year 2021. We set a September quarter revenue record of $83.4 billion, an increase of nearly $19 billion or 29% from a year ago, despite larger-than-expected supply constraints.",1
"We are incredibly proud of the product lineup we have going into the holiday season, and we are encouraged by the customer response weâve seen. And while we cannot know exactly which path the pandemic will take the world down in the months to come, we feel quite confident that this new year will be driven by the values that guide us and by the innovation that defines us.",1
"Weâve never had a more diverse range of services for our customers to choose from, and weâve been very encouraged by our performance, which reflects growing customer enthusiasm and satisfaction.",1
"All of our stores are now open worldwide and have been for 7 weeks. As we enter our busiest time of year, I particularly want to share my gratitude for our retail teams. Customers have never relied on our products more, and our retail teams have truly answered the call. We meet our customers where they are with many ways to shop through our online and retail stores and can help them choose the best product for them and get it up and running.",1
"In just its first two years, Apple TV+ has already proved itself to fans around the world. And I want to congratulate the incredible actors, writers, storytellers, producers and everyone else whose behind-the-scenes work has made that success possible.",1
"This quarter, Apple TV+ won 11 Emmys, including the Award for Outstanding Comedy Series for Ted Lasso. That show has continued to bring light and laughter to fans all over the world with its boundless optimism and beloved cast of characters. We couldnât be more proud of our entire lineup of content from the gripping second seasons of The Morning Show and Truth Be Told to our newest programs, Swagger, which is out tomorrow. The response has been incredible.",1
"This quarter also saw major updates to Fitness+, including the addition of new activities like meditation and pilates, and the announcement of group workouts, a feature that brings fitness and friends together. We also shared that Fitness+ will soon be available in 15 new countries, bringing workouts for every age and skill level to millions more people around the world.",1
"And those are just two of the services our customers are loving. This quarter, Apple Card won a J.D. Power award for customer satisfaction in its very first year of eligibility. The App Store continues to help people find the apps they depend on to stay productive, creative and entertained.",1
"And on Apple News, we launched a News Partner Program that expands Appleâs support for journalism while creating an even better business opportunity for publishers.",1
"As we continue to support our customers around the world, weâre glad to report weâve opened several new Apple Stores. This quarter, we opened a beautiful store in Changsha, which is our first store in the Hunan province of China. We also just opened our third store in Istanbul. And we recently added a store in the Bronx, which means we are now in all 5 boroughs of New York City.",1
"We are also excited about our education initiatives. This month, we introduced the Everyone Can Code Early Learners program, offering free resources, which helps students and elementary school learn coding. We see education not only as a fundamental good in its own right but is a great equalizing force. A world where all people can access a quality education isnât just a smarter world. Itâs a more equitable one. That desire to create a more just an equitable world is the guiding principle behind our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative. This quarter, Apple shared plans to expand our $100 million investment by an additional $30 million. Those funds will be used in a number of ways, including the creation of a new global Hispanic-serving institution equity and innovation hub. The hub will dramatically expand the technology and resources for students in the STEM fields.",1
"Weâve never viewed our environmental work as a side project. Teams across Apple are pushing this work forward in the same spirit of innovation we bring to our products and services. We are determined to be a ripple in the pond that drives a far greater change. From the pandemic to climate change to an equity and injustice, global challenges wonât abide solitary solutions, and we feel a deep sense of responsibility to help.",1
"Those programs join our ever-expanding work with historically black colleges and universities, including the now 45 community coding centers and regional hubs, serving underrepresented communities across the United States.",1
"This month, we were also happy to welcome the inaugural class of developers and entrepreneurs to the Apple Developer Academy in Detroit. The academy is Appleâs first in the United States and is designed to help prepare students for jobs in the thriving iOS app economy, which supports more than 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states.",1
"In August, we shared our impact accelerators first cohort of black, Latinx and indigenous-owned businesses whose pioneering work in green technology and clean energy serves many of the communities most impacted by climate change.",1
"More broadly, we are already carbon-neutral as a company. And this quarter, we made new strides towards reaching our goal of carbon neutrality across our entire supply chain and the life cycle of our devices by 2030. Weâve made significant product advances in this area. iPad and iPad mini now come with 100% recycled aluminum enclosure. The antenna on iPhone 13 is made up of upcycled plastic water bottles, which marks an industry-first. And as our customers are seeing when they purchase iPhone 13, weâve redesigned the packaging to eliminate that outer plastic wrap, which will allow us to avoid using 600 metric tons of plastic. This brings us closer to removing all plastic in our packaging by 2025.",1
"Weâve also made good progress toward our goal to one day make our products without taking anything from the earth. With Apple Watch Series 7, for example, 99% of the rare earth elements we use are recycled.",1
"Ahead of COP26, Iâm also pleased to report that we have more than doubled the number of our suppliers who have committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. Weâre very encouraged to see the growth in this area, and we will continue to drive those changes in the supply chain in the months and years to come.",1
"The other thing that is obviously happening is in many areas, the ARPU is increasing. And so, as there is more offers out there, I mean the one that is today getting the attention is on the streaming side.",1
"I think, we have opportunities, Amit, in both the growth of the installed base as Luca mentioned in his comments, we continue to grow across every category, hit new highs in the last quarter and we hit new highs in all of our top 20 markets.",1
Good afternoon and congrats on a strong quarter. Is there any information you can provide on how iPhone X pre-orders compared to what you saw with iPhone 8 pre-orders? And then I have a follow-up as well.,1
"Yes. Thanks a lot guys. I guess two questions from me as well. First one, Tim, if you think about the Services business, less than $2 billion away from the targets you had laid out a few years back. But I am wondering if you think about the growth rates you've had in the business over the last several years, the high-teens average, I think, how much of that do you think was driven by the installed base growing versus incremental monetization of the installed base. And do you see that ratio essentially flipping or changing as you go forward?",1
"Customer satisfaction with iPhone continues to be outstanding and is the highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone X, 8, and 8 Plus combined. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 80% plan to purchase iPhones.",1
"Turning to services, it was our best quarter ever in total and virtually in every market around the world, with revenue of $10 billion. A year ago, we had a one-time $640 million favorable impact to services revenue due to an accounting adjustment. And taking that into account, our services growth in Q4 this year was 27%. As Tim mentioned, we reached new all-time quarterly revenue records for many services categories, and we are well on our way to achieve our goal to double our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020.",1
"We now have over 330 million paid subscriptions on our platform, an increase of over 50% versus a year ago. We are very pleased not only with the growth but also with the breadth of our subscription business. In fact, 30,000 third-party subscription apps are available on the App Store today, and the largest of them all represents less than 0.3% of our total services revenue.",1
"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw great response to our new MacBook Pro models that we launched in July, with strong double-digit revenue growth driving an all time quarterly record for Mac revenue. We were especially pleased with Mac momentum in emerging markets, with strong growth in Latin America, in India, the Middle East and Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe.",1
"At over 100 million units, our active installed base of Macs is at an all-time high, and the majority of customers purchasing Macs in the September quarter were new to Mac.",1
"We sold 9.7 million iPads during the quarter, gaining share in nearly every market we track, based on the latest estimates from IDC. We generated iPad growth in a number of key regions around the world, including Latin America, Europe, Japan, India, and South Asia. Among customers around the world purchasing iPads during the quarter, nearly half were new to iPad, and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high.",1
"NPD indicates that iPad had 58% share of the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter, up from 54% share a year ago. And the most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 96% for both iPad and iPad Pro. And among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter, 74% plan to purchase iPads.",1
"Other products revenue grew 31% to a new September quarter record with an increase of over $1 billion compared to a year ago thanks to wearables growth of over 50% and the strong performance of Apple TV, in addition to the introduction of HomePod earlier this year.",1
"As we look back across fiscal 2018, we've made great progress in the enterprise market, where iOS is transforming how business gets done across multiple industries. In fact, over 450 airlines and 47 of the top 50 around the world have adopted iOS to help pilots fly saver, more efficient flights and many airlines are also using iOS to support better customer experiences and improve maintenance operations.",1
"We're also making great strides in the retail sector, where 9 of the top 10 global retailers use iOS devices to transform their customer and employee experiences. We're seeing industry-wide adoption of iOS at thousands of retailers from neighborhood boutiques to many of the best-known retailers in the world. Deployment of iOS devices is growing steadily as retailers replace their traditional point-of-sale systems and use custom iOS apps on iPhones and iPads to provide highly personalized shopping experiences.",1
"Our success in enterprise is supported by our key partnerships. Since launching our first strategic partnership with IBM, 240 large customers have signed MobileFirst for iOS deals. Additionally, earlier in the year we introduced two new technology offerings. IBM Watson services for Core ML, and the IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple that are enabling businesses to combine machine learning and cloud for a new generation of dynamic smart apps made for iOS. Over 60 new signings across numerous industries have been added since launching these new tools.",1
"In our new partnership with Salesforce, we're excited to bring together the number one customer relationship management platform and iOS. Together with Apple, Salesforce is redesigning its apps to embrace a native mobile platform with exclusive new features on iOS. The companies will also provide tools and resources for millions of Salesforce developers to build their own native apps with a new Salesforce mobile SDK for iOS.",1
"And finally, we recently announced Apple Business Manager, a new way for IT teams to deploy Apple devices at scale. The response from companies around the world has been tremendous with over 40,000 companies currently enrolled.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $102.5 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $122.6 billion. As explained earlier this year, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. As part of this plan, we returned over $23 billion to investors during quarter. We repurchased 92.5 million Apple shares for $19.4 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents.",1
"For our fiscal year 2018, revenue grew over $36 billion to $265.6 billion, an all-time record. Every geographic segment grew double digits with new records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia-Pacific. We also set new all-time records for net income, up 23% versus last year, and EPS up 29%. And we returned a total of almost $90 billion to our investors during the year, including almost $14 billion in dividends and equivalents and over $73 billion in share repurchases.",1
"We sold 46.9 million iPhones during the quarter, with growth of 20% or more in several markets, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, Chile, and Vietnam.",1
"iPhone revenue grew 29% with growth of more than 20% in every geographic segment. iPhone ASP was $793 compared to $618 a year ago, driven by strong performance of iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus, as well as the successful launch of iPhone XS and XS Max in the September quarter this year, while we launched iPhone X in the December quarter last year.",1
"We set new September quarter records for net income, EPS, and cash flow from operations. Net income was $14.1 billion, up $3.4 billion or 32% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.91, up 41%. Cash flow from operations was $19.5 billion, up $3.8 billion from a year ago.",1
"First education, more than 5,000 schools, community colleges, and technical colleges worldwide are now using Everyone Can Code, our free coding curriculum. Ideas, creativity, and passion for technology's potential aren't limited by zip code or country, and we don't think opportunity should be either.",1
"With revenue growth over 50%, it was another record quarter for wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products. With the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, Apple Watch has become an essential part of people's lives. The customer response to the Apple Watch Series 4 has been overwhelmingly positive, driven by its all-new design, larger display, faster performance, fall detection, enhanced cellular reception and electrical heart sensor.",1
"Later this year, the ECG App will be available to Apple Watch Series 4 customers in the U.S., giving them the ability to take an electrocardiogram any time, right from their wrist. And for U.S. customers with Apple Watch Series 1 and later, WatchOS will soon enable periodic checks for irregular heart rhythms that may be suggestive of AFib. These are unprecedented and potentially life-changing features, showing how Apple Watch is not only an indispensable communication and fitness companion but also an intelligent guardian for your health. More broadly, we see this as just one further example of the kind of contribution we can make in the health space and we look forward to making more in the future.",1
"We are proud to bring HomePod to new customers. I was in Spain last week as HomePod became available there and in Mexico. HomePod delivers the highest fidelity audio quality, working together with an Apple Music subscription to stream over 50 million songs into any room of your home.",1
"Our retail team posted record Q4 results to conclude their biggest year ever. They are transforming our stores into places where customers come to connect, learn, and be inspired together with people from their community. Our Today at Apple sessions are a terrific example of what that looks like in practice. We hosted over 250,000 Today at Apple sessions this quarter, connecting aspiring creators with local photographers, illustrators, and other experts who can help them get the most out of their devices. Apple Stores also hosted 74,000 kids at Apple Camp.",1
"The relationship Apple has with our customers is about more than just making a purchase. With the recent addition of beautiful new stores in Italy, Japan, China, and in just a few weeks, Thailand, we will have 506 stores where we can further those relationships, almost half of which are outside the United States.",1
"Before I turn the call over to Luca, I'd like to touch on two items that may not show up in our financial statement but are just as integral to Apple's mission and our commitment to making the world a better place.",1
"We're also excited that educators in more than 350 schools around the world have started working with Everyone Can Create, the free collection of tools and project guides we introduced this spring, designed to help unleash kids' creativity throughout their school day with the help of iPad.",1
"Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially, in line with our expectations, as leverage from higher revenue offset seasonal transition costs.",1
"Next is the environment. This was a milestone year for Apple's commitment to our planet. In April, we announced that 100% of our global operations are powered by renewable energy. We also made progress in doing the same in our supply chain. And just this week, we announced that the enclosures of new products like MacBook Air and iPad Pro will be made from 100% recycled aluminum, a strong, durable, and beautiful new alloy designed by Apple.",1
"This is a great example of how a commitment to do right on the issues that matter can drive once unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching old problems, and beautiful solutions that set us apart.",1
"I'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers, and business partners for helping us deliver outstanding results across our fiscal 2018. We are headed into the holidays with our strongest product lineup ever, and we could not be more bullish about Apple's future.",1
"And now, Luca has more details to share with you on the September quarter. Luca?",1
"We are extremely pleased to report record results for our September quarter, which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in which we saw double-digit revenue growth in every geographic segment and established new revenue and earnings records in every single quarter.",1
"Revenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and more than $10 billion over last year, with strong double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia-Pacific. In fact, we set new revenue records in almost every market we track, with especially strong growth in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, and Korea, all major markets where revenue growth was 25% or higher. We also set new fourth quarter revenue records for iPhone and wearables and new all-time records for services and Mac.",1
"Before we discuss our December quarter outlook, I'd like to describe a number of changes in our financial reporting that we're implementing as we enter our new fiscal year. First, given the increasing importance of our services business and in order to provide additional transparency to our financial results, we will start reporting revenue as well as cost of sales for both total products and total services beginning this December quarter.",1
"Second, also beginning in this December quarter, we're adopting the FASB's new standard for revenue recognition. This will not result in any change to our total revenue, but it will impact the way we report the classification of revenue between products and services. In particular, the revenue corresponding to the amortization of the deferred value of bundled services such as Maps, Siri, and free iCloud services was previously reported in product revenue. After adopting the new standard, this revenue will now be reported in services revenue. The change in classification between products and services will also apply to the costs that are associated with the delivery of such bundled services.",1
"After we file our 10-K, we will post a schedule to our Investor Relations website showing the reclassification of fiscal 2018 revenue from products to services in connection with the adoption of the new standard. The size of this reclassification amounts to less than 1% of total company revenue. And for clarity, this reclassification was not contemplated in our previously stated goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020. That goal remains unchanged and excludes the revenue that is now shifting from products to services over that timeframe.",1
"Yes, Shannon, I'll take this one. At the revenue level, we started from the fact that we are very, very excited about the lineup of products and services that we have getting into the holiday season. It's the strongest lineup that we've ever had. And our guidance range, by the way, represents a new all-time quarterly revenue record.",1
"And so the subscription business itself is nearly as broad as the App Store itself is, and so that's the value proposition. I think that the vast majority of people are very happy with it, including the most important people at all, which is the user.",1
"Thank you, Tim. I appreciate the response.",1
"If I could just ask you really quick on Apple's role in healthcare, it's been growing significantly since the early introduction in the Watch and then the various kits for developers, including HealthKit, CareKit, et cetera. And when you combine that with your very staunch advocacy for privacy, I see Apple could become a really large disintermediating force in all the friction in the healthcare industry today in the way medical information is shared and distributed. Is this the way that you see the future for Apple in healthcare? And do you see a means to also grow your services business through the healthcare offerings that could become subscriptions to your customers? Thank you.",1
"I think Apple has a huge opportunity in health. And you can see from our past several years that we have an intense interest in the space and are adding products and services, non-monetized services, so far to that. And I don't want to talk about the future because I don't want to give away what we're doing, but this is an area of major interest to us. Thank you.",1
Shannon Cross from Cross Research has the next question.,1
"Thank you very much for taking the question. Given the $4 billion range in revenue that you're giving for the quarter and all the things that are going on in the world right now, can you maybe give a little detail about the variables that you took into account when you were coming up with this? Geopolitical trade, macro, component costs, I don't know if you can just give us some ideas of what the puts and takes were. Thank you.",1
"As I explained in my prepared remarks, there are a number of things that need to be considered as part of this guidance range. The first one is the fact that the launch timing of the new iPhones this year is essentially in reverse order versus last year, and that has had an effect on Q4 and will have an effect on Q1.",1
"For the developer, we obviously provide the developers a tremendous amount of developer tools, programs, compilers, languages, of course the operating system, APIs, SDKs, and have a huge developer relations team. And we do a tremendous amount of marketing for developers, including the new Today Editorial that we just started in the past few months, personal recommendations, search tools, and so on and so forth.",1
"Last year, we launched the top end of our iPhone lineup, which was iPhone X, during Q1 and placed the entirety of the channel fill for iPhone X in Q1. This year, we launched the top end of the lineup, which is the XS and the XS Max during Q4. Obviously, this resulted in more pronounced ASP growth in Q4 of 2018 and obviously a tougher compare for Q1. So I think it's important to keep that in mind as you look at the revenue guidance that we provided.",1
"The second point that needs to be kept in mind, it is a fact of life and we dealt with it for a number of years now, is the fact that when I look at currencies around the world, virtually every foreign currency has depreciated against the U.S. dollar in the last 12 months. And when we look at the impact of foreign exchange on our revenue for the December quarter, we're looking at 200 basis points of headwinds which translates, given our the size of our business, to almost $2 billion of headwind to our revenue.",1
"The third point that I think it's important to keep in mind, and Tim has talked about this, we are launching, in the last six weeks, we've launched an unprecedented number of new products. They're all ramping right now. The ramps are going fairly well, but obviously we have some uncertainty around supply/demand balance for some of these products.",1
"And then finally, the last point that we've taken into account is what Tim's talked about in terms of some level of uncertainty at the macroeconomic level in some emerging markets where clearly consumer confidence is not as high as it was 12 months ago. So take that into account and that's how we got to the range.",1
"Okay. Thank you. And then, I just want to talk a little bit about the pullback in terms of guidance from a unit perspective. I understand you don't want to give guidance because of 90 days is a short period of time and it can fluctuate, but what kind of qualitative commentary do you think you'll be able to provide? Because it's obviously investors have spent the last however many years going P times Q. So, how should we think about what we can expect and sort of how are you going to manage this process as we go through? I know it's all our job to forecast, but.",1
"Yes. Let me walk you through the rationale that we've used and then I'll talk about this qualitative commentary that you were mentioning. As I said, right, our objective is to make great products, provide the best customer experience, and get our customer satisfied, engaged and loyal to our ecosystem.",1
"And so there will be â there's no doubt in my mind there have already been some large developers that concluded that they could do something on their own. We're fine with that. I think Luca mentioned in his comments that the largest â if I look at the largest developer, they make up less than 0.3% of the services revenue, so it's probably good to think about that in that context, and there are millions of apps on the store obviously, and 30,000 or so subscription apps.",1
"If you start with the user, what the App Store provides people is the best and safest place for users to get apps. And we have a tremendous process and infrastructure around achieving that. And where it is not perfect, we wind up reviewing over 100,000 apps per week between new apps and updates for existing apps, and then work with developers quickly to fix the issues. And we also provide the user a one-payment model for purchasing apps and subscriptions and in-app purchases, et cetera, so that they are not in a position that they have to share their private information across many companies. And so that's the proposition for the user.",1
"Third, starting with the December quarter, we will no longer be providing unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and Mac. As we have stated many times, our objective is to make great products and services that enrich people's lives, and to provide an unparalleled customer experience so that our users are highly satisfied, loyal and engaged.",1
"Thank you, Luca, and we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?",1
"As we accomplish these objectives, strong financial results follow. As demonstrated by our financial performance in recent years, the number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. Furthermore, a unit of sale is less relevant for us today than it was in the past, given the breadth of our portfolio and the wider sales price dispersion within any given product line.",1
"Fourth, starting with the December quarter, we will be renaming the other products category to wearables, home, and accessories to provide a more accurate description of the items that are included in this product category.",1
"As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We have the strongest lineup ever as we enter the holiday season and we expect revenue to be between $89 billion and $93 billion, a new all-time record.",1
"This range reflects a number of factors to be considered. First, we considered the effect on Q4 and Q1 of the launch timing of our new iPhones this year versus last year. Second, we expect almost $2 billion of foreign exchange headwinds. Third, we have an unprecedented number of products ramping, and while our ramps are going fairly well, we have uncertainty around supply and demand balance. And fourth, we also face some macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in emerging markets.",1
"We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5% before discrete items.",1
"Also today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock payable on November 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of November 12, 2018.",1
Certainly. Our first question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.,1
"In terms of larger developers, if you step back and look at the value proposition for people from the App Store, there are two key constituencies in that equation. There's the user and there's the developer.",1
"Yes. Thank you. Tim, there has been some real deceleration in some of these emerging markets, partly driven by some concerns around some of the rules the administration is contemplating and partly driven by things that are more specific to China, for instance, like some of the regulations around gaming. So can you talk about how you see the trajectory there for the business and what you think of the initiatives of some companies like Netflix and Fortnite trying to bypass the App Store around subscriptions and I have a follow-up.",1
"Sure. Great question. Starting with emerging markets. The emerging markets that we're seeing pressure in are markets like Turkey, India, Brazil, Russia. These are markets where currencies have weakened over the recent period. In some cases, that resulted in us raising prices and those markets are not growing the way we would like to see.",1
"To give you a perspective in of some detail, our business in India in Q4 was flat. Obviously, we would like to see that be a huge growth. Brazil was down somewhat compared to the previous year. And so I think, or at least the way that I see these, is each one of the emerging markets has a bit of a different story, and I don't see it as some sort of issue that is common between those for the most part.",1
"In relation to China specifically, I would not put China in that category. Our business in China was very strong last quarter. We grew 16%, which we're very happy with. iPhone in particular was very strong, very strong double-digit growth there. Our other products category was also stronger, in fact, a bit stronger than even the overall company number.",1
"The App Store in China, we have seen a slowdown or a moratorium, to be more accurate, on new game approvals. There is a new regulatory setup in China, and there things are not moving the way they were moving previously. We did see a few games approved recently, but it's very far below the historic pace. And as you've probably seen, some of the larger companies there that are public have talked about this as they've announced their earnings as well. We don't know exactly when this will â the approvals will return to a normal pace, so I would not want to predict that.",1
"I do not view â just for avoidance of doubt here, I don't view that that issue has anything to do with the trade-related discussions between the countries. I think that is strictly a domestic issue in China.",1
"We also unveiled the biggest update ever to Mac mini, the small yet muscular desktop that powers everything from the music and sound effects at Broadway shows to the developers who build some of the most popular apps in the App Store. The new Mac mini boasts an amazing 5 times faster performance than before.",1
"As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, earlier this week we announced exciting updates to the Mac lineup. The all-new MacBook Air brings a stunning Retina display, Touch ID, the latest processors and an even more portable design to the world's most beloved notebook.",1
"We set an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue, thanks to strong performance in MacBook Pro and the impact of the back-to-school season. In September, we delivered macOS Mojave, bringing powerful new features to Mac like Dark Mode, Stacks and a completely redesigned Mac App Store. Consider alongside the release of iOS 12, WatchOS 5 and a new tvOS, macOS Mojave tells a powerful story of the seamless integration of world-class hardware, software and services that define the Apple ecosystem.",1
"So it'd be really helpful. You have in the past commented on first 24-hour orders, for which there were 4 million plus for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. You have very often on this call talked about targeting when you think you could reach supply/demand balance. So it'd be really helpful if you could provide some context in terms of what you know, either about initial orders or about a supplies versus history that can help investors try and better understand the little data points that they're seeing in terms of availability of the device. Thank you.",1
"I think, Steve, we've been in a competitive position. And so I probably maybe have a different view than you do or the folks that you're quoting. There's always doubting Thomases out there. And I've been hearing those for the 20 years I've been here and suspect I'll hear about them until I retire, right. So I don't really listen to that too much. There's lots of fantastic people here and they're doing unbelievable things. And yes, I view AR as profound. Not today, not the app that you'll see on the App Store today, but what it will be, what it can be. I think it's profound and I think Apple is in a really unique position to lead in this area.",1
"Yes. Thank you. Just following up a little bit on that question, Tim. You talked a bit about providing a lot of value and that Apple sets its prices according to value. And I think given the uniqueness of the product you have with the iPhone X in particular, that makes a lot of sense. I guess the question is given the uniqueness of the value that you have in the marketplace, why shouldn't we â should we, or why shouldn't we expect gross margins to improve this cycle versus previous ones? And perhaps you can talk a little bit about how you think about pricing in the context of gross margin. And I have a follow-up, please.",1
"Toni, I'll take that one. When â you said we price our products for the value that we deliver. We also said that every time we launch new products, the cost structures of the new products tend to be higher than the products that they replace. It's inevitable. We are adding new technologies, new features, and therefore the cost structures go up. We have a very good track record of taking those cost structures and over the life cycle of the product, we are able to bring them down.",1
"There are a lot of elements in the gross margin line that we have good control over and there are also elements that we don't control. Take for example foreign exchange, which has been a significant headwind for the company for the last three years now. Also, the mix of products that we sell into the market tends to change over time, and that also has an impact on the overall gross margin for the company. There are situations where the commodities markets are in good shape. There are situations where commodity markets can be a bit out of balance.",1
"We have a case right now around memory pricing, which is a headwind for the time being. So there's many puts and takes. The fact that our Services business is growing, it should be a positive because our Services margins tend to be accretive to company margins. So there's many puts and takes. We tend to think about maximizing gross margin dollars because we think that's the most important thing for investors at the end of the day. When we look at our track record over years, I think we've found a good balance between unit grow and gross margins and revenue, and we will continue to do that as we go forward.",1
"Okay. Thank you for that. And then I wanted to revisit this notion of supply and demand, and I realize it's very early and you can't make predictions. I think a common investor question is, the iPhone X was made available for sale. It quickly had pushed out availability levels to unprecedented levels versus history. And so I think the really significant question is, is that initial push-out really a function of uniquely strong demand versus history or is that push-out in availability really a function of much weaker supply versus history?",1
"The truth is we don't know. We've put our best estimate into the guidance, and you can see from the guidance that we are very bullish. And so, and we feel really great about the product lineup. We just sold the first units minutes ago. And so we'll see how things go. Until you get all of them out there where customers have the ability to demo and support, I think any kind of mix discussion is very much estimating. And so we put our best estimates in, but grantedly, we've never done this before. So there's no comparison here, with either the three iPhones nor the staggered launch. So we're going to learn something.",1
"In terms of the way we price, we price to sort of the value that we're providing. We're not trying to charge the highest price we could get or anything like that. We're just trying to price it for what we're delivering. And iPhone X has a lot of great new technologies in there that are leading the industry, and it is a fabulous product and we can't wait for people to start getting it in their hands.",1
That is Jim Suva with Citigroup.,1
"Thanks very much. And I'll ask my original question and follow-up at the same time because they're slightly different topics. But you'd mentioned great success in India. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments you mentioned, I think, India doubled year over year. Based upon market analysis, it looks like Apple's still just a relatively small sliver of the pie there. So Tim, what would it take be even more successful in India? Is it a manufacturing footprint there? Is it partners? Is it more physical stores? Is it lower price points? Is it the bandwidth that has now caught up to many other countries, or how should we think about that?",1
"And then the follow-up question is on the AR/VR, where will it really show up in your income statement? Are you hoping more for hardware sales or services through the apps or where the excitement will then monetize it within Apple? Thank you.",1
"In terms of India, many of the things that you mentioned are correct. Growing a market like India is a result of all of those things and doing them all well. And so it's analogous to the many years that we put into China. It's building stores. It's building channels. It's building markets. It's building the developer ecosystem. It's having the right product lineup for the market. And I feel like we're making good progress there and are gaining understanding of the market, but we still have a long way to go, which I sort of see as an opportunity instead of a problem. And I do feel great about the growth rate. And so that's India. I think it's all of those things.",1
"As you know, as I think we talked about before, we started manufacturing the iPhone SE there six, nine months ago so. And the majority of the iPhone SEs that we sold in the domestic market last quarter were manufactured there. And so we also have that going and are hoping that that winds up saving some amount of money over time and avoiding some of the compounding of taxes, et cetera.",1
"The bandwidth issue has also been an issue, but as you point out, it is being addressed and between the large carriers there with Bharti and now Jio investing the way they are, the service in India is materially better than it was just 12 months ago. So there's been a sea change there in a short period of time. So I feel good about all that, but we have a long way to go.",1
"And then I wanted ask, the Street historically has been a little skeptical about continued innovation and you've suggested there is more to go. Historically, you weren't first to large screens, you weren't first to OLED. Now though, you're leading in AR, you're leading with face ID, which the all-in a year ago, as some of your guys have suggested, was kind of very reminiscent of the aggressive Apple. Is it possible going forward that you could accelerate share gains from Android because you're now in a stronger competitive position?",1
"The other thing to keep in mind is that many people are now trading in their current iPhone on the next iPhone. And the residual value for iPhone tends to be the highest in the industry and many people pick up $300, $350 or so for their iPhone and so that even reduces the monthly payment less. And then obviously, some carriers also have promotional things going on. And so I do think it's important to try to place it in that context.",1
Thank you so much for your details. Thank you.,1
"Thank you very much. A couple questions. The first, Tim, can you talk a bit about how you're thinking in terms of the lineup? You go from $340 â this is for iPhone â you go from $349 to above $1,000. And it appears that you probably sold a fair amount at the lower end. Perhaps that was just some of the switchers in China and maybe drove some of the growth in China in terms of market share. But how are you sort of thinking about what went into the guidance for the December quarter? Are you seeing really strong demand at the low end and obviously expected benefit from the X at the high end? I'm just trying to understand because you have such a broader lineup than you've had in prior years.",1
"Michael, we never go through mix, but I would share with you that the iPhone X orders are very strong for both direct customers and for our channel partners, which as you know, are lots of carriers throughout the world. And we couldn't be more excited to get underway. And I think as of a few minutes ago, the first sales started in Australia. And I'm told we had several hundred people waiting at the store in Sydney and I'm getting similar reports from across that region.",1
"All right. Thanks. And we're excited about augmented reality and from your perspective, and maybe from our perspective on the outside looking in, how do we gauge the success of AR and what are some of the applications of the technology that you're most excited about today? Thanks.",1
"Yes, it's a great question. The reason I'm so excited about AR is I view that it amplifies human performance instead of isolates humans. And so as you know, it's the mix of the virtual and the physical world and so it should be a help for humanity, not an isolation kind of thing for humanity.",1
"As I go through different countries as I've been traveling lately, and looking at some things in the market, other things that are coming, the very cool thing is they're all over the place. I see things that the consumer's going to love because it's going to change shopping. I see things that consumers will love on the gaming side and the entertainment side. I see business-related AR apps as well. They're going to be great for productivity and between small and large business. And I see apps that makes me want to go back to K-12 again and repeat my schooling because I think it changes the game in the classroom a lot.",1
"And so the real beauty here is that it's mainstream. And of course, Apple is the only company that could have brought this because it requires both hardware and software integration, and it requires sort of making a lot of â or giving the operating system update to many people at once. And the software team worked really hard to make that go back several versions of iPhone so that we sort of have hundreds of millions of enabled devices overnight. And so there's 1,000-plus in the App Store right now. I think this is very much like in 2008, when we fired the gun in the overall App Store. And so that's what it feels like to me, and I think it will just get bigger from here.",1
"Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"Yes. In terms of what we saw in Q4, you can probably tell from the ASP we had good success, I would say, through the different iPhones. And we've tried hard to have an iPhone that is as affordable as possible for people that really want an iPhone but may have a more limited budget. And we've got some iPhones that are really great for that market. And then we've got three new iPhones and people will look at these and decide which one they want. And this is the first time we've ever been in the position that we've had three new iPhones at once like this at the top end of the line. And it's the first time we've had a staggered launch. And so we're going to see what happens, but we put our absolutely best thinking that we have here in the guidance that Luca presented, and you can tell from that, that we're bullish.",1
"But in terms of price elasticity, I think it's important to remember that a large number of people pay for the phone by month. And so if you were to go out on just the U.S., since that tends to be more of the focus of this call, you look at the U.S. carriers, I think you would find you could buy an iPhone X for $33 a month. And so if you think about that, that's a few coffees a week. It's let's say less than a coffee a day at one of these nice coffee places.",1
"Great. Thank you. And then in terms of Services, $8.5 billion, up 34%, can you talk about some of the portions of that that outperformed, how sustainable? You mentioned China in terms of significant growth in Services, but I'm just curious. That's a pretty remarkable number, so I'm curious what the drivers were. Thank you.",1
"Yes, Shannon. It's Luca. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there was a $640 million adjustment and there was a one-off change. And it's important to call it out because of course it's a one-off. And so the underlying growth rate for service in the quarter was fantastic. It was 24%. It's the highest growth rate that we've had for services during fiscal 2017. So the business is going incredibly well. I would highlight maybe three of these businesses within Services at the App Store set a new all-time record. It's going incredibly well.",1
"The number of paying accounts continues to grow very strongly, and that's very, very important to us for the App Store business. Apple Music was up, subscriptions were up 75% year over year. We're getting the highest conversion rates that we've had since the launch of the service. And so we turned the corner in Music. You remember that a few years ago, we were actually declining in Music; now with the streaming service in addition to the download business, the business is growing again. And that really helps the growth rate for the entire Services business.",1
"iCloud is a service that continues to grow very strong double digits, and that's also helping. So we already become the size of a Fortune 100 company. We set a goal for ourselves to double what we did in fiscal 2016, and the trajectory is actually quite positive.",1
"Thank you. I wanted to try to push a little bit more on the mix. Could you comment whether the 8 Plus outsold the 8 in the quarter? There seems to be some data that suggests that. And the 451 Research survey that you're alluding to also finds that over the next 90 days, those buying an iPhone, 43% are planning on buying the X. Could you comment upon your expectations in terms of the mix going forward? And if you won't do that, perhaps you could comment a bit about your thinking in terms of pushing price elasticity. I think a couple years ago, nobody would've imagined selling a phone at this price and obviously, you're pretty confident that you can do it.",1
"Obviously, I'm not going to talk about mix. That's something that we've done in the past. If you look at the 8 and 8 Plus, when we launched them, they instantly became our top two selling products. If you look at 8 Plus in particular, to provide a little color there, 8 Plus for the period of time that we can measure to date, has gotten off to the fastest start of any Plus model. That for us was a bit of a surprise, and a positive surprise, obviously. And so we'll see what happens next. As I've mentioned before, we've never had three products and it's only today that the first customers can sort of look at all three of those and I'm sure there's been some people that wanted to do that before deciding even which one. And so we'll see what happens there.",1
"In terms of the monetization question on AR/VR, we tend to focus first and foremost on customer experience. And so we're all about making sure the experience is great. And we think that if we get the experience right, that revenues and profits will be a result of getting that right. And so we're very much focused on the experience right now.",1
"That will come from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets,",1
"We continue to invest in our strategy to replace the wallet with the recent launch of student ID passes at several major U.S. universities. And 10 months following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest-rated mobile peer-to-peer service by Consumer Reports, based on exceptional payment authentication and data privacy.",1
"iOS 12 has gotten off to an incredible start. It's been installed on more systems in its first month than any version of iOS ever. iOS 12 is delivering system-wide performance enhancements, Siri Shortcuts, and new tools to help people reduce interruptions and manage screen time for themselves and their kids.",1
"In fiscal year 2018, our revenue grew by $36.4 billion. That's the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company in a single year, and we're capping all that off with our best September quarter ever. Revenue was $62.9 billion, ahead of our expectations. That's an increase of 20% over last year and our highest growth rate in three years. We also generated record Q4 earnings with 41% year-over-year growth in EPS. Record results from iPhone, services, and wearables drove our momentum and we produced strong double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segments.",1
"It was a big year and a big quarter for iPhone. Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X, and the very successful launch of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max.",1
These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever with the industry's first 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple designed 8-core Neural Engine capable of executing an astounding 5 trillion operations per second. The A12 Bionic is many years in the making and a huge technological leap forward.,1
"It sets the iPhone experience far apart from the competition, using real-time machine learning to transform the way we experience photos, gaming, augmented reality and more. It makes full use of the dual camera system that shoots portrait mode photos with Smart HDR and dynamic depth of field and Face ID is even faster.",1
"The response has been powerful. As one reviewer put it, iPhone XS and XS Max are the perfect blend of design and craftsmanship, as well as seamlessly intuitive user experience. We're not done yet.",1
"Just last week, we began shipping iPhone XR, bringing the latest iPhone breakthroughs to even more users. With an all-screen glass and aluminum design and the most advanced LCD in a smartphone, the product reviews have been overwhelmingly positive.",1
"Siri Shortcuts in particular is already deeply integrated with some of the most popular apps out there. Whether you're tracking your workouts or rushing to catch a flight, you can be sure all of your most relevant apps are working together with Siri in the driver seat.",1
"For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the Associated Press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"iOS 12 also features ARKit 2, a major upgrade to our augmented reality engine. ARKit 2 makes possible simultaneous multi-user experiences and real-world object incorporation. Our developer community is really running with this technology. From gaming to shopping, we're seeing great new use cases emerge. iOS devices deliver the best AR experiences of any products in the market today and with the announcement of our new iPad Pro this week, we've made that gap even wider.",1
"More powerful than the vast majority of PC laptops, the new iPad Pro is unrivalled in its versatility and performance. When paired with the beautifully refined Apple Pencil and a new streamlined full-size Smart Keyboard, iPad Pro will extend its lead as the ultimate creativity and productivity device. And finally, just this week, we delivered the highly anticipated Group FaceTime functionality to all FaceTime-enabled devices.",1
"For services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue at $10 billion. Excluding the impact of a favorable one-time accounting adjustment of $640 million a year ago, our services growth was 27%.",1
"We set new Q4 records in all of our geographic segments and new all-time revenue records for the App Store, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Music and Apple Pay. We also continued to see strong growth in paid subscriptions reaching over 330 million in our ecosystem.",1
"I want to spotlight the exceptional performance at Apple Pay, which is by far the number one mobile contactless payment service worldwide. Transaction volume tripled year-over-year. And to put that into perspective, Apple Pay generated significantly more transactions than even PayPal Mobile with over 4 times the growth rate.",1
"As a testament to accelerating U.S. growth, Costco completed the rollout of Apple Pay to over 500 U.S. warehouses last quarter, while Neiman Marcus is now accepting Apple Pay at over 40 stores across the country. With these additions, 71 of the top 100 merchants and 60% of all U.S. retail locations support Apple Pay.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us. I just got back from Brooklyn, where we marked our fourth major launch event of the year. In addition to being a great time, it put an exclamation point at the end of a remarkable fiscal 2018. This year, we shipped our 2 billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store, and achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple's history.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consistent of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.",1
"Thanks a lot for taking my question, guys. I have two as well. I guess maybe to start with on gross margins. Luca, year over year revenues are going to be up high single digits at the midpoint, gross margin will be down a little. Could you just tell us what are the puts and takes on that? And are yield inefficiencies broadly much more severe this time versus what you've seen historically?",1
"Yeah, Tim, I'm wondering if we take a look at mainland China and we think about iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, they've been on sale for a while now. What has been the just general response to those two new iPhones and also preorders around the iPhone X in mainland China?",1
"Yes. Amit, so we're guiding 38% to 38.5%. That's up 35 bps sequentially. Obviously we're getting the leverage from the larger volumes. As I mentioned, I think to Toni, we have higher cost structures every time we launch new products. So that is going to be the offset, and I mentioned particularly the impact from the memory pricing environment which is a headwind at this point. Just to size it for you, the impact of memory on our gross margin is 40 bps sequentially and 110 bps on a year over year basis. So they are meaningful impacts, and I think that is what I think probably you're referring to.",1
"Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess if I could just follow up on the Services line. I mean you guys talked about it a fair amount earlier, but even if you exclude the one-time gain, it looks like the back half of 2017 accelerated by 500 basis points in fiscal 2017 versus the first half of 2017. Qualitatively or quantitatively, is there a way to think about how much of this is from expanding of the installed base, which is one of the three things you mentioned I think, versus more dollar per iOS device that you see?",1
"Yes. I think it's both. As I mentioned, particularly on the App Store, which is very important to us, the number of paying accounts has grown a lot. It's grown a lot because, as you said, the installed base has grown, but also because we have made a number of changes that have made it easier for our customers around the world to participate on the App Store and be able to transact on the App Store. We are accepting, for example, more forms of payment today than we were 12 months ago or even 6 months ago. So that's been very important.",1
"We also see that there is a typical spending curve for our customers. When they start transacting on the Store, they start at a certain level and they tend over time to get more familiar with the Store and they start to spend more. We're also now, very recently, made some changes, as you probably have seen, to the design of the App Store. And I was mentioning to you in the prepared remarks that these changes have been received very favorably. And so people now are spending more time on the Store, they download more apps, and that over time translates into monetization.",1
"But we also have other businesses that are growing very, very fast and actually accelerating. I mentioned Music. I mentioned iCloud, and so it all adds up. And as you correctly point out, our growth rate is accelerating.",1
"From Drexel Hamilton, Brian White.",1
"Brian, I hate to repeat this, but we don't really disclose mix. We view it as competitive information that we want to hold tightly ourselves. In terms of the way the preorder process works in China in the channel, so not in our direct channel, but in the broader carrier channel and channel, they generally take indications of interest versus something that I would label a preorder. And so I would hesitate to even quote a number for fear it could be misconstrued. And we'll find out what the demand and where the supply and demand meet sometime in the future. I don't know when yet, but we're really excited to get going to find out.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"And, Tim, it's interesting that sales grew 16% sequentially. If you look at the past five years, sales were up 7% in the September quarter, so that's an average. Yet you didn't have all your iPhones in the market. So if you had to, what would you attribute that to? It's a pretty big disconnect, 16% versus an average of 7%.",1
"Our emerging market performance during the quarter was very strong. And if you take China out, it's even stronger. But you can see that China rebounded. And as I'd indicated before, the China rebound was broad based across the products. And so we just had a phenomenal quarter on iPad, on the Mac, on Services, on Apple Watch, on iPhone. I mean we're literally, we're firing on all cylinders. And so that's what, that and our new products give us great confidence headed into this holiday season that this is going to be the best holiday season yet.",1
"And, Tim -",1
"A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820, and please enter confirmation code 2484260. These replays will be available by approximate 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.",1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414, and financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570, and I'm at 408-974-5420. Thank you again for joining us.",1
Good day and welcome to the Apple Incorporated fourth quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded.,1
"When you look at our financial performance in recent years, take the last three years, for example, the number of units sold during any quarter has not been necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. If you look at our revenue, given the last three years, if you look at our net income during the last three years, if you look at our stock price here in the last three years, there's no correlation to the units sold in any given period.",1
"As you know very well, in addition, our product ranges for all the major product categories have become wider over time and therefore, a unit of sale is less relevant for us at this point compared to the past, because we got this much wider sales price dispersion, so unit of sale per se becomes less relevant.",1
"As I know you're aware, by the way, our top competitors in smartphones, in tablets, in computers, do not provide quarterly unit sales information either. But of course we understand that this is something of interest and when we believe that providing qualitative commentary on unit sales offers additional relevant information to investors, we will do so.",1
"The new program complements our continued investment in our growing global network of over 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers the lead the industry for customer satisfaction and help millions of people with both in and out-of-warranty service for all Apple products.",1
"We also established new all-time records for the App Store, Apple Care, Music, Cloud Services, Payment Services and our App Store search ad business. In total, services accounted for 20% of our revenue mix and 33% of our gross margin mix.",1
Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high with double-digit growth in paid accounts in all our geographic segments.,1
"We now have 450 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform compared to over 330 million just a year ago, and we are well on our way to our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark during 2020.",1
"Absolute revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased almost 40% year-over-year.",1
"There are now more than 35,000 subscription apps on our platform, with the largest accounting for less than 0.25% of total services revenue. Among our many all-time services records, it was the best quarter ever for AppleCare. Thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and expanded distribution.",1
"And to better meet our customers' needs, we announced a new iPhone repair program making it easier for independent providers across the U.S. to tap into the same resources as our Apple Authorized Service Provider network and offering customers additional options for the most common out-of-warranty iPhone repairs.",1
"Next, I would like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $7 billion, down 5% from last year due to a different mix of products, given the strength of our MacBook Air line-up and a difficult comparison to last year's launch of MacBook Pro models.",1
"Our active installed base of iPhone continues to grow to a new all-time high in each of our geographic segments. And in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. Among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the December quarter 83% plan to purchase iPhones.",1
"Despite the tough compare, we generated an all-time revenue record for Mac in the US and in India and a fourth quarter revenue record in Japan. More than half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all-time high.",1
"We had great results for iPad with revenue of $4.7 billion, up 17% from a year ago. iPad revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments with a Q4 revenue record in Japan. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the September quarter were new to iPad, and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high.",1
The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 95% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and 97% from businesses. And among both consumers and businesses who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter more than 80% plan to purchase iPads.,1
"Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new fourth quarter record with revenue of $6.5 billion, up 54% year-over-year with growth accelerating from the third quarter across all five geographic segments.",1
"The performance was driven by tremendous growth across Apple Watch, AirPods, BIS products and accessories. And as Tim mentioned, we set Q4 records for our Wearables category in every single market we track around the world.",1
"Our retail and online stores produced fantastic results, generating record September quarter revenue in all five geographic segments, and strong double-digit growth across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and accessories. We also continue to see great results from our trade-in program with more than five times the iPhone trade-in volume we had a year ago.",1
"Turning to Services, we had a very strong quarter with all-time record performance and growth accelerating from the June quarter. All five geographic segments set new all-time Services revenue records and all grew double-digits.",1
"Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $33.4 billion a year-over-year decline of 9%. This was a meaningful improvement to the 12% decline in the third quarter and a 16% decline in the first half of the fiscal year. And we saw great customer response to the launch of iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro max at the end of the quarter.",1
"This iconic store is opened seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and provides an even better environment for customers to experience our latest products, meet with our geniuses, created pros and specialists, and attend our free daily Today at Apple sessions.",1
We're driving access to critical coding skills development to educators and students through programs such as our teaching coding academies and our free everyone can code curriculum. We continue to put user privacy at the center of everything that we do and we know that Apple is strongest when our commitment to diversity and inclusion brings all voices to the table.,1
"Pulling back the lens from a single quarter, we are incredibly proud of our accomplishments over the course of a remarkable fiscal 2019, a year where we crossed $100 billion in revenue in the United States for the first time.",1
"We introduce new services from Apple Card to Apple TV+ and generated over $46 billion in total services revenue, setting new yearly services records in all five of our geographic segments and driving our Services business to the size of a Fortune 70 company.",1
"We delivered incredible new hardware in all our device categories. Our Wearables business showed explosive growth and generated more annual revenue than two-thirds of the companies in the Fortune 500. And we set a yearly revenue record for Mac. All told, outside of iPhone, our revenue grew by $17 billion to almost a $118 billion.",1
"Our overall success was achieved widely across our markets with annual revenue records in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. And as we head into the holiday season, we have an enormous amount to look forward to. We believe that we lead in innovation because we lead with our values.",1
"At the time of urgency and action on climate change, we continue to drive breakthroughs in clean power sustainable materials and device recycling. By running a 100% of our global operations on renewable energy and challenging our entire network of suppliers do the same, we are driving a virtuous cycle of demand for clean sources of power. And we see the award Apple recently received from the United Nation's Global Climate Action program as a mandate to deepen this vital work.",1
"We continue to invent and improve on cutting edge renewable materials, including the 100% recycled aluminum alloy found in many of our products, and we've added rare earth elements to our list of recycled materials with the introduction of iPhone 11. We're disassembling, recycling or refurbishing millions of devices every year with the help of Daisy, our recycling robot, and we're pushing the entire global supply chain toward recycled or renewable materials.",1
"I'd like to thank our customers, our developers, our business partners and our employees for making fiscal 2019 such a success, and I look forward to another great year in 2020.",1
"Net income was $13.7 billion. Diluted EPS was a Q4 record at $3.03 and up 4% year-over-year, and operating cash flow of $19.9 billion was also a Q4 record, up almost $400 million from the previous record we set last year.",1
"Now for more details on our September quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was $64 billion, up 2% from a year ago to a new September quarter record as we had predicted foreign exchange negatively impacted our revenue by close to $1 billion, and in constant currency, our growth was 3%.",1
"Products revenue was $51.5 billion, down 1% from last year, mainly due to iPhone, but largely offset by very strong performance from Wearables and iPad. Services revenue grew 18% to $12.5 billion, up over $1.9 billion year-over-year and almost $1.1 billion sequentially to a new all-time record with broad-based growth around the world and across our portfolio.",1
"On a geographic basis, we set new fourth quarter revenue records in our Americas and rest of Asia-Pacific segments. We also saw continuous improvement in Greater China where year-over-year revenue comparisons became more favorable each quarter of fiscal 2019 from a 27% decline in the first quarter to a 2% decline in the fourth quarter.",1
"At a country level, we established new Q4 records in many major developed and emerging markets including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Korea, Singapore, Brazil, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.",1
"Company gross margin was 38%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue. Products gross margin was 31.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially due to leverage and favorable mix. Services gross margin was 64.1% even with the June quarter.",1
"Last month, we reopened the standing Apple Fifth Avenue store in New York with an even more welcoming layout beneath the landmark glass cube providing nearly twice the space of the original store.",1
"We also opened our newest and largest store in Japan, and fifth store in Tokyo, in the Marunouchi business district across from the historic Tokyo Station, and we opened a beautiful new store in the heart of Mexico City's vibrant Polanco district to welcome visitors to experience the best of Apple in Mexico.",1
"Earlier this month, we released macOS Catalina with all new entertainment apps, the innovative sidecar feature that uses iPad to expand the Mac workspace and new accessibility tools that enable users to control their Mac entirely with their voice. Catalina also brings the Apple Arcade experience to the Mac and we have already seen some amazing third-party developers bring their iPad apps to the Mac App Store with Mac Catalyst including Twitter, Post-it and more.",1
"Michael, it's Tim. The Wearables have done extremely well. It was acceleration further from the previous quarter. So we're thrilled with the results as to what's driving it it's the totality that's driving it. For some people it's about fitness; for some people, it's about health; for some other people, it's about communication; and for some people, it's all of the above. And I think the new feature of Always-On on Series 5 is a game changer for many of our users.",1
"Great. And Luca on margins guidance is consistent with September, but there is a lot going on under the covers; tariffs could expand in mid-December; there is some impact from the TV+ bundle; you have some big currency in commodity price move. So can you just talk about the gives and takes that land you at the December quarter gross margin guidance?",1
"Yes. Katy, of course. As you said, I mean at the midpoint of the range, we are essentially flat sequentially. On one side, we expect -- on the positive side, we expect leverage from higher revenue. On the other side, foreign exchange for us continues to be probably the biggest headwind that we've got right now is going to be negative 70 basis points on a sequential basis.",1
"Also keep in mind that during the holiday season, we have a higher mix of products revenue than we have in other quarters, and that obviously is dilutive to the company -- to the company margin.",1
"On a year-over-year basis, we are also about flat. And on one side, we've got better commodity pricing, the environment is better than it was a year ago, but foreign exchange is a negative impact of 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis.",1
Our next question will be from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.,1
"Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. So Wearables category has been strong, and it's hard to believe it's now essentially the same size as Mac. But related to Apple's initiatives in healthcare, do you think health-related features are a primary driver of Wearables growth and maybe conversely how important is a rising installed base of Wearables and the data that's associated with that to the ongoing innovation within Apple health? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"And in terms of other health-related things that we have going, we will be continuing to build out our health records connection into the health app, really democratizes the information about people's health, and so they can easily go from doctor to doctor.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations on the quarter. iPhone revenue trajectory did improve, but it's still declined 9%. So can you talk about the drivers that will allow you to get that category back to growth? And if you think that's something that's realistic to expect in fiscal '20?",1
"We've got the research going that I had mentioned earlier, there will be more of those through time, and obviously we've got things that we're not going to talk about just yet that we're working on. But as I've said before, my view is there will be a day in the future that we look back, and Apple's greatest contribution will be to people's health.",1
"Okay. Thanks. And then with the strong slate of content in Apple TV+, can you just talk about the strategy behind giving it away to those that are buying in applicable device versus charging for it? And my congrats to Nancy. And thank you.",1
"Yes, it's a gift to our users, and from a business point of view, we'd like to -- we're really proud of the content. We'd like as many people as possible to view it. And so this allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers, particularly in the early going. And so we are - we feel great about doing that.",1
"I think it's a bold move. And the price also for those people that are not buying a device in the period of time that we offer this, the price is very aggressive as well. You think - think about the quality of content that you get for 499, and it's amazing. It is amazing.",1
"Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question please?",1
That will come from Evercoreâs Amit Daryanani.,1
"Katy, it's Tim. We are very thrilled with what we're seeing in early going on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. It's early but the trends look very good. So I don't want to make a long-range forecast here. We've put our current thinking in the guidance and you can tell from the guidance we are bullish.",1
"Certainly, today that will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.",1
"We are seeing strong demand for our products in the enterprise market, with growth significantly ahead of our business overall, and we have great momentum transforming major industries.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $260 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $7 billion of new term debt, retired $3 billion of maturing debt and reduced commercial paper by $4 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $98 billion at the end of the quarter and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time.",1
One example is retail. 80 of the 100 largest retailers in the world are choosing Apple to modernize their customers and employee experiences across all functions of their business.,1
"Retailers are using iPhone, iPad and Mac to optimize their back of house operations, modernize point of sale, and deliver differentiated customer and employee experiences.",1
"Customer engagement and assisted selling have been areas of particular focus and we're seeing great results for iconic brands such as Burberry, Ralph Lauren, Sephora USA, Gap Inc., and many others.",1
"Weâre also having been government agencies around the world, use technologies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the way they deliver critical services to the public. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau is making fundamental changes to the design and implementation of next year's census with a goal of producing quality results, while reducing costs by leveraging the mobility user experience and privacy of iOS.",1
Hundreds of thousands of Apple devices will be deployed this fiscal year to support an innovative new model for the collection and management of Census data and we are proud that our products will play an important role in driving quality to this critical initiative while safeguarding the privacy and security of this data.,1
"CDW Apple's partner in this initiative will also utilize Apple Financial Services, our enterprise financing platform to help minimize the cost to the public by taking advantage of the uniquely strong residual value of Apple devices.",1
"We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the September quarter, including almost $18 billion through open market repurchases of 86 million Apple shares and $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. We also retired an additional 7 million shares in the final settlement of our 14th ASR.",1
"Thank you very much for the kind remarks, Luca. It's obviously been a great privilege for me to engage with so many investors and analysts on behalf of Apple over the last couple of decades, and of course it's been an extreme pleasure to work alongside with some of the brilliant people here at Apple on a day to day basis. But let's get to the business at hand for the 93rd time, and open the call to questions. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please.",1
"As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the type of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $85.5 billion and $89.5 billion. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of over $1 billion.",1
We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $9.6 billion and $9.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%.,1
"Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock, payable on November 14, 2019 to shareholders of record as of November 11, 2019.",1
"Before we open the call to questions, I also have a special announcement to make today. Nancy Paxton, our Head of Investor Relations for the last 23 years has decided to retire at the end of December after a wonderful 33 year career at Apple and 93 earnings calls. Nancy has been the face of Apple with analysts and investors over a period of incredible growth and success.",1
"Her passion for our company, her commitment and dedication to serve our entire investor base and her sense of humor will be missed greatly. Personally, I'm very grateful for the advice and support you have given me during this last six years. We all wish you the very best for the next and exciting phase of your life.",1
"With that, let us open the call to questions.",1
"And for our pro customers who push the limits of what Mac can do, we're very excited about the upcoming launch of our newly redesigned Mac Pro this fall, which we are proud to be manufacturing in Austin, Texas.",1
"For Mac, we generated $7 billion in revenue. We had a tough comparison to last year's fourth quarter when we updated both models of MacBook Pro, but for fiscal 2019 overall, we generated the highest annual revenue ever from our Mac business. In July, we updated our Mac portables with great pricing for students and MacBook Air in particular has been a hit in the back-to-school season.",1
"Looking at one additional point there just for clarity is, Shannon, our intention is to continue to give revenue guidance at the company level and gross margin guidance in the other categories that we've been providing and so that our guidance isn't changing. It's the actual report that changes.",1
"The currency weakness has been part of our challenge there, as you can tell from just looking at the currency trends, but I view these as speed bumps along a very long journey, though. And the long term I think is very, very strong there. There's a huge number of people that will move into the middle class. The government has really focused on reform in a major way and made some very bold moves. And I applaud them for doing that and I can't wait for the future there.",1
"On the other hand, as I mentioned before, currencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar, and the impact that we expect at the gross margin level from foreign exchange is a 90 basis points headwind sequentially. And of course, at this point in the cycle, we also have higher cost structures because, as I said, we've launched so many new products in the last six weeks. So those are the puts and takes, leverage and commodity savings on one side and FX and the new products on the other side.",1
"Next, we'll go to Jim Suva with Citigroup.",1
"Thank you very much, a question for Tim and a question for Luca, and I'll ask them at the same time, so you can decide who wants to go first or second. But operationally, Tim, I think your company is at a disadvantage relative to others in India, giving where items are produced versus shipped versus taxed versus installed as well as ability to own stores. So can you help us address that? Is India going to potentially be a big area, as I think you got about only about 1% market share, but it sounded like things may be softer there?",1
"And then for Luca, there will probably be a lot of pushback about not giving iPhone unit data. It sounds like you're still going to give revenue data, if I heard that correctly, but some people may fear that this now means that the iPhone units are going to start going negative year over year because it's easier to talk about great things and not show the details of things that aren't so great. So thank you very much, gentlemen.",1
"Okay, I'll start with India. We've had really great productive discussions with the Indian government, and I fully expect that at some point, they will agree to allow us to bring our stores into the country. We've been in discussions with them, and the discussions are going quite well.",1
"As you point out, there are import duties in some or most of the product categories that we're in. In some cases, they compound, and this is an area that we're giving lots of feedback on. We do manufacture some of the entry iPhones in India, and that project has gone well. I am a big believer in India. I am very bullish on the country and the people and our ability to do well there.",1
"And, Jim, let me take the question on units. First of all, as Tim said, our approach to guidance, providing guidance doesn't change at all. We continue to provide the same metrics that we were providing before.",1
"You're referring to the guidance that we provided for Q1, I imagine.",1
"In terms of reporting results, one of the things that we are doing, and it's new and it's in addition to the information that we provide to investors because we've heard some significant level of interest around this, is starting with the December quarter, for the first time we're going to be providing information on revenue and cost of sales, and therefore gross margins for both products and services. And this will be the first time that we're going to provide gross margin information for our services business, which we believe is an important metric for our investors to follow.",1
"Given the rationale on why we do not believe that providing unit sales is particularly relevant for our company at this point, I can reassure you that it is our objective to grow unit sales for every product category that we have. But as I said earlier, a unit of sale is less relevant today than it was in the past.",1
"To give you an example, the unit sales of iPhone at the top end of the line have been very strong during the September quarter, and that's very important because we're attracting customers to the most recent technologies and features and innovation that we bring into the lineup, but you don't necessarily see that in the number that is reported.",1
"And so therefore, we will, as I said, we'll provide qualitative commentary when it is important and relevant. But at the end of the day, we make our decisions from a financial standpoint to try and optimize our revenue and our gross margin dollars, and that we think is the focus that is in the best interest of our investors.",1
"Jim, let me just add a couple things to that for color. Our installed base is growing at double digit, and that's probably a much more significant metric for us from an ecosystem point of view and the customer loyalty, et cetera. The second thing is this is a little bit like if you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier and she says, or he says how many units you have in there? It doesn't matter a lot how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what's in the cart.",1
"Thank you, Jim. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcast, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone and the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and please enter confirmation code 3699080. These replays will be available by approximately 5:00 PM Pacific Time today.",1
"Let me give you the puts and takes, Katy. You're correct. We are going to be getting some benefits from commodities in general and memory in particular. Memory on a sequential basis is about 30 basis points favorable for us going into the December quarter. And obviously, we're going to be benefiting from the leverage, which is typical of our seasonality in the December quarter.",1
"That's helpful color. And, Luca, as a follow-up, NAND prices fell significantly during the September quarter. Why aren't we seeing that flow through to margin expansion for the overall company?",1
"Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Apple Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.",1
"Of course, we're also improving the quality of the services that we provide and if you look back during the last three years, we've added new services to our portfolio. We added Apple Pay, we added Apple Music. We added this advertising business on our App Store. And clearly, we will want to continue to offer new services over time, so there are a number of vectors that allow us to continue to grow the business over time.",1
Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.,1
"Thanks very much and good afternoon. With the staggered iPhone launch, were you able to discern any impact on the XS and XS Max from buyers potentially waiting for the XR, and what if anything can we take away from the December quarter guidance related to what you're seeing for early demand of the XR? And then I have a follow-up, thanks.",1
"Mike, it's Tim. The XS and XS Max got off to a really great start and we've only been selling for a few weeks. The XR, we've only had out there for I guess five days or so at this point, and so we have very, very little data there. Usually there is some amount of wait until another product shows up and look, but in looking at the data, on the sales data for XS and XS Max, there's not obvious evidence of that in the data, as I see it.",1
"Got it, and you mentioned record levels for various components of the services business. As we look forward, if growth of services is to maintain something close to the recent pace, what are the components of services that you're particularly excited about that could drive that and be the strongest drivers? And maybe an offshoot to that, it seems like the news flow around augmented reality has slowed a little bit in recent months. Is that potentially a materially contributor to services in the near future? Thanks.",1
"Mike, as we said, during the September quarter, we set new records for many, many services categories, right, from Apple Music to cloud services to the App Store to AppleCare and Apple Pay really has an exponential trajectory right now.",1
"When we look at our services business, we think about the fact that we have a very large and growing installed base. The installed base of all our major product categories is at an all-time high and has been growing over the last several quarters, so the opportunity for us to monetize our services business continues to grow over time.",1
"We have stated that we want to double the size of the services business from the level that we had in fiscal 2016 by 2020. We are well on pace to achieve that, and we feel very, very confident about the future and the opportunities that we have in the services space.",1
"And I'm still of the mindset that I feel very optimistic and positive that the discussions that are going will be fruitful. These relationships, these trade relationships are big and complex, and they clearly do need a level of focus and a level of updating and modernization. And so I'm optimistic that the countries, the U.S. and China and the U.S. and Europe and so forth, can work these things out and work for the benefit of everyone.",1
"Mike, in terms of your question on AR, I have a different view than you do on this one. Just a year ago, practically a year ago, we came out with ARKit 1. Six months or so after that we came out with 1.5. We then recently came out with ARKit 2. The number of things that you can do are growing significantly. The number of developers that either have done something, or even more the case, that are working on things that I've seen are growing tremendously.",1
"There's a lot of interest out there and the number of categories that I'm seeing from gaming to shopping, to I was in China a few weeks ago and saw AR in an art sense, in an art exhibit. I was in Berlin last week and saw it being used in a historical educational kind of sense. I'm seeing it sort of everywhere I go now, and so I think we are in the early days, and it'll keep getting better and better, but I'm really happy with where things are at the moment.",1
Next we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Thank you. Tim, given the current trade negotiations and broader geopolitical risk, do you have any plans to consider diversifying the supply chain? And if you were to do that, either on your own or sort of forced, do you think it would have significant impact on the business or profitability?",1
"Katy, if you look at the products that we have created and are manufacturing, they're really manufactured everywhere. We have significant content from the U.S. market. We have content from Japan to Korea to many countries, and we have great content from China as well, and so there are many hands in the products. The vast majority or almost all of the R&D is in the United States, as well as a lot of the support organizations.",1
"And so, I think that that basic model where you look around the world and find the best in different areas, I don't expect that model to go out of style, so to speak.

"We achieved revenue of $64 billion in the quarter at the high end of our expectations, even in spite of a predicted foreign exchange drag of almost $1 billion.

"iPhone revenue in the September quarter was $33 billion. This 9% decline over last year is a significant improvement over the 15% decline we saw across the first three quarters.

"I want to touch on a number of services in brief. We had all-time record revenues from payment services.

"For Services, revenue was $12.5 billion, that's up 18% over last year and it beats the previous record set in the June quarter by more than $1 billion. This isn't a local phenomenon. We saw double-digit services revenue growth and all-time records in all five of our geographic segments, and it wasn't a narrow success either.",1
"We established new all-time highs for multiple services categories including the App Store, AppleCare, Music, cloud services and our App Store search ad business. We are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal year '16 Services revenue during 2020.",1
We are off to a great start in fiscal year â14. We continue to be very confident in Appleâs future and we see significant opportunities ahead of us and both current product categories and new ones. We are participating in large and growing markets. Today smartphone penetration of the global handset market is only a little over 50%.,1
"We have solicited feedback on our capital return program from shareholders in the past. We greatly appreciated their suggestions and we will actively seek their input again this year. As weâve in the past, the Board and the Management team will consider a wide range of issues and be thoughtful and deliberate and we will announce any changes to our current program in the first part of the new calendar year.",1
"In fact, we returned over $36 billion to shareholders to dividend and share repurchases in the last five quarters alone. We remain firmly committed to our objective of delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both our business performance and a return of capital. We review our capital program regularly and our orders engaged in the discussion of capital allocation on an ongoing basis.",1
"In closing, we are extremely proud of our record-breakingfiscal 2007 results. We generated over $24 billion in revenue and $3.5 billionin net income. We sold 7 million Macs and 52 million iPods, each growing bymore than 30% over the prior year. We introduced the revolutionary iPhone andsold over 1 million in the first 74 days. Our retail stores hosted over 100million visitors and produced $4.1 billion in revenue.",1
"Thatâs correct. The payments on AT&T depend on beinglocked to AT&T, obviously.",1
"And then in terms of thinking about next quarter, the cellphone market is modestly seasonal. Typically your Mac business has been flat toslightly up and in Q1, your iPod business has been up 100% or more. The phonemarket tends to be up about 15% or so as a market. Is that how you areanticipating, all else being equal, obviously youâre entering three newcountries this quarter, but if we think about how you guys think aboutseasonality, do you think this might be more or less seasonal, given its pricepoint, than the typical phone market? And how do we think about that?",1
"Well, in the phone market for our phone estimate, we lookedat the three new markets that we are going into for the first time and so thathad a lot to do with our own internal estimate. And then we looked at theseasonality of the phone market as well in the U.S.",1
"Next weâll go to Rob Semple of Credit Suisse. Mr. Semple,your line is open.",1
"Rob, are you there? Could we move on to the next caller,please?",1
"Next weâll go Mike Abramsky from RBC Capital Markets. Hearingno response, weâll move to our next question. Weâll go to Keith Bachman fromBank of Montreal. Hearing no response, weâll move on to Bill Fearnley of FTNMidwest.",1
"Hi, at Apple, can you guys hear us? This is Bill Fearnley.Can you hear me? Because you missed Rob Semple, you missed some of the otherguys as well. Am I connected?",1
"Yes, we can hear you.",1
"Okay, we just skipped over three of my colleagues so thereâsa problem with the conference call bridge. A quick question for you, if Icould, on the iPhone; in terms of the iPhone, Tim, last call you had mentionedthat you had had a couple of corporate customers that were piloting the iPhonein the enterprise. Anything you can share there for an update?",1
"Also, any update on any cannibalization that you are seeingwith the iPhone versus the iPod? And then also, on pilots, if I missed it inthe preamble, I apologize, but are there any updates on the pilot with Circuit City? Thanks.",1
"On Circuit City, weâre not doing a pilot with Circuit City.We are focusing on expanding with Best Buy. I had mentioned the numbers on thatearlier. We ended with 230 Best Buy stores and expect to be north of 270 by theend of the quarter.",1
"All the iPhone customers are reporting incredible customersatisfaction and weâve achieved 95% of those whoâve said that they wouldrecommend the phone to others and so I -- you know, these numbers areunprecedented in our history.",1
But you had mentioned specifically enterprise test on theconference call last quarter. Any updates specifically on those enterprisetests that you were running now?,1
"No, I donât have any updates on those.",1
"Okay, and then in terms of cannibalization, any commentaryyou can give on cannibalization, iPhone, from the iPhone to the iPod, please?",1
"And then, you raised the issue of the unlock intention. Ipresume that phones that are sold that ultimately are not subscribed to theAT&T network are not eligible for any payments from AT&T, correct?",1
"The only thing that Iâll say, Toni, is we obviously saw anacceleration once we took the price cut. Weâre not going to get into disclosingour daily sales.",1
"And can you give me a sense of the daily sales rateimmediately following the price cut versus the daily sales rate, either at theend of the quarter or over the last week? Has it been maintained or have weseen -- have we seen an acceleration or a degradation in that daily sales rate?",1
"Just the handset amortized over 24 months, the accessoriesrecognized in the period, and the payments. Is it that same structure?",1
"Thanks. Peter, just sorry to keep coming back to this rebatequestion, but it sounds like you are going to recognize that rebate as a periodimpact on COGS, but I think you are recognizing the rest of COGS on the iPhoneover a 24-month amortization. Is that -- am I hearing that correctly?",1
"Yes, as regard the iPhone $100 credit. We will account forit when customers redeem their credit. We will charge it to the cost of theproduct to cost of goods sold, and we expect most of the redemptions to occurby the end of the December quarter.",1
"Just to clarify though, why are you doing the rebate as aperiod cost, whereas the rest of COGS for the iPhone is more amortized over the24 months?",1
"Sure. The credit was an additional but unspecified productdeliverable to iPhone customers, which is why we are not accounting for beforeit was redeemed but accounting for it at the point of redemption.",1
"Okay, and then on the European carrier revenue rec, is thatalso going to be structurally similar to the AT&T revenue rec in terms ofwhat the components that are period costs versus the components that are amortizationcosts?",1
In terms of payments that we may receive from Europeancarriers?,1
"We will recognize the revenue from handsets over 24 months,regardless of where they are sold. We will recognize revenue from iPhoneaccessories at the time of sale, and we will recognize payments from AT&Tand other carriers as revenue over time as earned.",1
"Weâre not going to project precise numbers, as I told Andybefore, in terms of as we go into Q1, but we remain very confident with hitting10 million units in calendar year 2008.",1
"Okay. Tim, real quickly, just a benchmark on the number ofMac distribution locations, the number of iPod locations?",1
"Weâre over 40,000 on iPod and within the last year, weâveadded about 2,000 Mac locations, to around 8,700 currently.",1
"Thanks, Harry. Could we have the next question, please?",1
Next weâll go to Toni Sacconaghi from Sanford Bernstein.,1
"Thank you. Iâm trying to get a better sense of howsignificant elasticity was around the price cut with the iPhone. My sense wasobviously in Q2, you did 135,000 phones a day. In -- excuse me, in Q3. In thispast quarter, you were probably doing 5,000 to 10,000 phones a day before youcut the price, and then you averaged about 18,500 phones after you cut theprice on the iPhone per day. Can you give us a sense of what the trajectory ofdaily sales volumes was from the iPhone immediately following the price cut andthen how that ended 22 days later at the end of the quarter? Was it relativelyconstant? Did it actually get better as the word leaked out? Can you give us asense of that? Because clearly when you initially announced the product, youhad a strong deceleration from enormous anticipation to when you cut the price.",1
"Toni, we were very happy with the elasticity that we saw. Itenabled us to far surpass our expectation of hitting around a million unitscumulatively by the end of the quarter. Some number of these were sold topeople that have an intention to unlock and where we donât know precisely howmany people are doing that, our current guess is there is probably 250,000 ofthe 1.4 million that we sold where people had bought them with the intention ofdoing that. Many of those happened after the price cut.",1
"We saw no obvious cannibalization prior to the new iPodannouncement. Post the new iPod announcement, we really donât have enough datato comment yet. We will report again in January.",1
"Okay, and then one last question, if I could shift gears tothe Macintosh, please. In the pro segment, any update on what youâve seen interms of uplift from CS3 or some of the other new products that have goneuniversal binary? Thank you.",1
"Weâve seen an incredible growth in our video business,driven by Final Cut Studio. Weâve seen an incredible growth in our audiobusiness, driven by the new Logic software that we just put out.",1
"Hi, guys. Can you hear me now?",1
"And finally, this was the most successful back-to-schoolseason we have ever had. And so all of those together have led to acontinuation of a huge momentum that now gives us, adds up to 11 quarters outof the last 12 where weâve grown faster than the market and specifically, thelast several at a multiple of the market.",1
"Are there any risks of your scale? Obviously youâve had someadvantages that youâve touted over some of the larger competitors, includingthe lack of viruses, for example, on your operating system and your hardware,your ability to maintain a far more high touch buying experiences. Do you feelcomfortable that as you scale, you will be able to sustain these advantages?",1
"We have been growing a lot of the -- our NPD share is up to16% in the U.S., which is a terrific increase for us. But there is still a lotof room left for growth and as you know, we scaled iPod from being a fairlysmall business to the last holiday quarter, we sold 21 million iPods and weâvesold over 120 million in total so far. We really have an experience at scalingthe product.",1
"Okay, and last question, you talked about the iPods shippingto Windows and that being a big driver obviously of Mac. In Europe, are youexpecting a similar halo effect due to iPhone sales there helping otherproducts further, like iPods and Macs?",1
"You know, weâll see. Weâre just launching in Europe onNovember 9th and so weâve got a lot to learn. However, I would point out thatour European business in the Mac area grew 47% year over year and this is overfour times IDC projection of growth for Western Europe, and so obviously thereis substantial evidence to say that the iPod has really helped us in Europe aswell.",1
Next weâll go to Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal.,1
"Okay, great. Related to the last comment, Tim, the othersegment in terms of unit growth had tremendous CPU unit growth, as did Europe.How do you think about expanding your channels in those categories, either onthe direct side or the indirect side, whether it be store openings or otherretail partnerships to continue to capture, or have the opportunity to capturesome of that growth?",1
"We attribute this to one, the fact that we are shipping thebest Macs in the history of the company; and secondly, an incredible receptionthat we received to the new iMac that launched in August; third, weâve nowshipped over 120 million iPods, and most of these were shipped to Windowscustomers who never owned a Mac, so we introduced the Apple brand to them throughthe iPod.",1
"Keith, the other segment for us in particular is Asia-Pacific.It did grow 52% year over year. It is our fastest growing region, and as Iâvementioned earlier, we have added 2,000 store fronts to Mac distribution overthe last year and we are continuing to asses quality partners and quality storefronts to continue increasing that.",1
"But of that amount of 2,000, I know on the direct side howmany youâve done, but can you give me any sense of what proportion are out ofthe U.S. geo of those 2,000?",1
There are many of those that are in Asia and Europe -- manyof those.,1
"Okay, let me ask two quickies, then; Tim, do you think --youâve obviously announced that you are going to do Asia-Pacific in terms ofthe iPhone. Do you think you can enter that market by having a 2.5G phone asopposed to a 3G phone?",1
We have nothing to announce today in terms of our entry intoAsia other than to reaffirm our plans to enter in 2008.,1
"Okay, the last one then, I just want to sneak one in; Peter,I was also one of the guys cut off at the beginning. Did you indicate what yourcash flow from ops or your free cash flow, either one, for the quarter was,please?",1
"Net, you can see this as a result, over 50% of the Macs thatwe sold in our retail stores were to customers who never owned a Mac before soweâve been very successful at expanding our customer base.",1
"We did have an incredible quarter on the Mac with breakingour previous Mac record by 400,000 units, and it was the end of an incredibleyear for the Mac because we did twice as many Macs as we did in 2004.",1
"In the D&P space, the D&P space is slow. I think asbuyers evaluate changing to both CS3 and Leopard.",1
"Okay, and I apologize from this because I was cut off at thebeginning of the presentation, but did you give the CapEx number for thequarter? And then, your outlook for the fiscal year?",1
Next weâll go to Rob Semple of Credit Suisse.,1
"Hey, itâs Rob. Can you hear me now?",1
We can hear you. Sorry about that.,1
"Thatâs okay. No problem. A question on the iPod Touch and Iguess the iPhone; I know the price cut came about the same time as you launchedthe Touch. Did you see any potential cannibalization I guess away from theiPhone for people that opted for the lower price point of the Touch? I knowthatâs difficult to quantify but just anecdotally, did any of your consumersurveys show that?",1
"Again, in terms of generically, we did -- we saw no obviousevidence of cannibalization from the iPhone to the iPod prior to the launch ofthe new product and since the launch of the new product, we really donât haveenough data.",1
"As you know, we were still in the early stages of rampingthe iPod Touch at the end of the quarter.",1
"Rob, I didnât give the outlook. Weâll do that when we fileour 10-K in a few weeks, but our capital in the quarter was $292 million and itwould have then been 822 for the year, for fiscal â07.",1
"Excellent. Thank you. More of a high level question; couldyou just talk a little bit about the drivers that you were experiencing on Macmomentum and market share shifts? Thereâs obviously several dimensions here --youâve got new buyers, new product lines, new distribution, new software. Canyou just give us a little color, perhaps, on which one of those are perhapsmost significant to some of the momentum that you are seeing, or perhaps theyall are, and some color on those that are being reflected into your guidance?",1
"Okay, and then just lastly, guys, what do you estimate thesize of the Mac installed base right now? And then, what percentage of thatinstalled base is on Tiger?",1
"Let me give you two numbers, which I think are the mostimportant to you. The vast majority of Macs shipped in the last four years areable to run Leopard. Specifically, this number is about 21 million. When weannounced Tiger, there were 15 million units that were eligible to run Tigerand we did $100 million of revenue on Tiger in the first quarter of launch.",1
"Okay. Thanks, Tim.",1
"Thanks, Rob. Could we have the next question, please?",1
Next weâll go to Mike Abramsky from RBC Capital Markets.,1
Thanks. Can you hear me now?,1
Next weâll go to Harry Blount from Lehman Brothers.,1
"Andy, I give you guidance each quarter that we believe wehave a reasonable chance of achieving, and Iâve talked to you about our view ofhow we are performing in our product areas and Tim has made some comments insome of our distribution areas as well. And we are very confident in ourstrategy and the team here at Apple has been working incredibly hard for anumber of years and things are just really coming together quite well for usand I couldnât be happier.",1
"Lastly, Peter, over the last I guess eight quarters, youâveexceeded guidance. And I know that you are trying to give us a good sense ofwhat is going to happen, but how should we interpret now you are looking at avery strong quarter, youâre a little above where the street is. How should wecalibrate your guidance at this point?",1
"You know, as we indicated a couple of quarters ago, it is amulti-year exclusive agreement.",1
"Gene, in terms of iPhone, we are recognizing revenue fromhandset sales over a 24-month period of time. We actually do do that on a dailybasis. Our revenue from iPhone, which includes amortization of handsets, accessorysales, and payments from AT&T was $118 million in the quarter.",1
"Okay, so for the AT&T contribution and the iPhonecontribution, itâs on a 24-month, it depends on the month that the phone issold, is that correct? Itâs not the quarter, itâs the month?",1
"No, for the handset, we are amortizing that revenue over 24months but as regards payments from AT&T, we will recognize those paymentsas revenue over time as earned, and Iâm not going to get into some more detailthan that.",1
"Okay, so that could be by the day, potentially?",1
"Gene, Iâm just not going to get into any more detail aboutour carrier agreements.",1
"Okay, and I guess this is probably another category of moredetails, but is the AT&T, is it generally a longer term kind of agreementor more near-term, or any thoughts along that --",1
"Okay, and then just one final question; from the Best Buystores, how many Best Buy stores were kind of up and running at the end of thequarter? How many do you expect by the end of the December quarter?",1
"Good afternoon and congratulations. Peter, if you could talka little bit about the line item, iPhone related products and services, interms of when Iâm doing the math here as far as revenue contribution perquarter for the iPhone, itâs the 1/8th or -- is it by the month or by thequarter? Can you give a little bit of clarity on that?",1
"Gene, we had 230 operating at the end of the Septemberquarter and we expect more than 270 at the end of the December quarter.",1
Has that had an impact on the business or do you still kindof see that --,1
Weâre very pleased with it. It had very good results and weare looking forward to expanding it in this quarter.,1
Next weâll go to Richard Gardner of Citigroup.,1
"Thank you. I had two questions. First of all, I thought itwas quite encouraging that your PC channel inventories were below your targetrange, despite the fact that you did expand the Best Buy agreement in thequarter, and I was hoping you could give us some detail on why that was thecase.",1
"And then secondly, I was also surprised to hear that highercomponent prices were one of the reasons that you cited for sequentially lowergross margin in the fourth calendar quarter because, based on our checks, mostcomponents seem to be coming down in price now, so I was hoping that Tim, youmight be able to reconcile that for us.",1
"Second is how does it work for the AT&T revenue share --is it also calculated by day, by month or by quarter?",1
Next weâll go to Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray.,1
"In terms of the channel inventory on the Mac, we primarilyhave low inventories at the end of the quarter because our sales were higherthan expected.",1
"More precisely on the guidance for iPods, it would seem thatlaunching in September, did you feel that a lot of iPod sales are pushed intothe December quarter and not necessarily pushed, but just naturally the fulllineup hasnât had a chance to be fully reflected and thatâs part of the reasonfor the guidance as well, or -- and how do we reconcile the sequential for Macsas well? It would seem the guidance implies Macs are up.",1
Weâve clearly accelerate the momentum for iPhone sales withour new pricing and we are very enthusiastic about our entry into the Europeanmobile phone market next month.,1
"We are looking forward to our best December quarter ever, aswe head into the holiday buying season with the strongest product lineup inApple history.",1
Question-and-AnswerSession,1
(Operator Instructions) Weâll take our first question from Ben Reitzesfrom UBS.,1
"I donât like to cheerlead, but nice quarter. The question isregarding the guidance. With regard to your usual pattern, Peter, you seem tobe more conservative usually. You guided up versus the street by quite a bit to$9.2 billion, maybe arguably $700 million better. What are you seeing thatallows you to be so confident in the face of some people being worried aboutthe economy at this time?",1
"Regarding the economy, weâll leave forecasting the globaleconomy to others. But as I commented at the end, Apple is shipping the bestproducts that we have ever made in our history. We just eclipsed the recordthat we set for Mac sales last quarter by 400,000. iPod sales accelerated afterthe transition and weâll shipping the best iPods that weâve ever made, and theiPhone is doing really, really well. So weâre quite confident in the businessand weâve exited the September quarter with a lot of momentum.",1
"Let me begin with Macs and maybe Iâll let Tim address youriPod question. For Macs, in the two most recent quarters, units have beenrelatively flat from the September quarter to the December quarter, as oureducation business falls off and is more or less offset by holiday consumerbuying.",1
"Well, as I commented in my prepared remarks, we are lookingforward to Leopard shipping this week. We are very excited about Leopard, butin terms of -- and I didnât think youâd forget about that, but I wanted to focusyou on some factors that I think on the net basis will cause more gross marginsto go down, and thatâs why I made the comment that I did.",1
"This year, itâs possible that Mac sales could besequentially a little lower, given the extraordinary success of theback-to-school promotion, which intensified the seasonality of the Septemberquarter.",1
"Okay, so youâre saying Macs could be lower due to thatpromotion? Okay.",1
It could be. We had just a fantastic September quarter butreally back to school and our higher ed results were an all-time high for thecompany.,1
"Ben, in terms of iPod, sales accelerated dramatically afterthe introduction of the new iPod and based on some early market share dataweâve seen from the U.K., France, and Germany, our share is up significantly inthe month of December, or September. The U.K.up 12 points, Japanup 12 points, and Franceup 6 points.",1
"Given these kinds of increases, we feel that we are verywell positioned going into the holiday quarter.",1
"Got it. And then lastly, with regard to gross margin, Peter,you talked about going from 33.6 to 31, and you mentioned that the iLife salesgo down but we have Leopard shipping on the 26th. I was surprised to hear younot mention that as a major offset on the gross margin line.",1
"Sure. On your component question, hereâs something we seegoing on in the quarter; as you know, Rich, DRAM and NAND Flash markets werefavorable last quarter and we believe that will continue during our Q1. Harddrive and LCDs were tight last quarter and they continue to be at the beginningof this quarter, but we do expect these to stabilize as the quarter unfolds.The other commodities are trading near or are declining near historical norms.",1
"Okay, and Tim, that channel inventory calculation is done ona forward sales basis, correct?",1
"In terms of revenue, the revenue that you see on the sheet,the iPod had a very difficult compare because we sold a very large number toone telecom company for promotional purposes a year ago, so that was the maindriver in the revenue decline.",1
Next weâll go to Andrew Neff of Bear Stearns.,1
"Okay, and then maybe if you could talk a little bit aboutthe ramp in iPhone through the quarter? Obviously a pick-up as you lowered theprice, Any more color you can give us there?",1
"Shannon, we certainly saw sales accelerate after the pricereduction and as Peter mentioned earlier, we were able to sell 1.1 million forthe quarter, giving us a cumulative number of 1.4, and so we were very happy tocheck that major checkpoint off our list.",1
"Okay, and then just one final question; maybe you could talka little bit about efforts you have to address the SMB channel, both with Macsand iPhone? Just curious if thatâs helping to ramp and if any specifics you cangive us.",1
"The SMB market is difficult to measure. However, in terms ofwhat we can see operating out of our online stores and out of our retailstores, we are doing well there and growing.",1
"In terms of iPhone, you know, weâve said many times that weare providing a solution in iPhone that many businesses love. It gives thepeople a desktop class e-mail, which is very unusual for a phone and is anunprecedented Internet device. And I think clearly there are some businessesbuying them and very much enjoying them.",1
Are you working with Salesforce.com on their initiative tomodify their software for iPhone?,1
"Thanks. Just a couple of things; one, if you could clarify,Peter, what you were saying about the tax rate this quarter. Is it anythingthat weâll see again next year? Maybe give us a sense of the guidance for nextyear?",1
"Good afternoon. Just going back to the revenue question,could you talk maybe, Peter, a little bit about the biggest drivers quarterover quarter? Because obviously thereâs a substantial ramp coming and is itmore Mac or iPod or anything you can give us? Because itâs a big increase.",1
"Second, I guess Tim, if youâd like, you told us when youthought you shipped the millionth iPod. Any sense of when you are going to shipthe three-millionth iPhone -- Iâm sorry, iPhone?",1
"Iâll start with that one. The answer is we are notpredicting, Andy. I would reiterate that we are very confident with shipping 10million in the calendar year of next year. We are very happy to ship ourone-millionth and by the end of the quarter, 1.4.",1
"I think itâs interesting to note that the 1.4 million, ittook us over 24 months, over two years to achieve a comparable number on iPodand so weâre thrilled here. Weâve very focused on going into the U.K. andGermany on early, in early November and then in France in late November andweâre on target to enter Asia in calendar 2008. A lot of focus on iPhone.",1
"Andy, to your tax rate question, the tax rate in theSeptember quarter was about 27%, which was lower than our anticipated 32%,primarily due to a benefit from prior year audits that we had. And as I gaveyou in my guidance, I expect the tax rate to return to 32% in the Decemberquarter.",1
"Also, could you just give a sense about Japan? Thatâs theone market that seems to be, on the Mac side, lagging and thatâs been laggingfor some time. Youâve talked about the market growth issues before. Anythingelse going on in Japanthat you could talk about?",1
"Andy, itâs fair to say that Japan continues to be our mostchallenging major market. It is the only market that we -- a major market thatweâre not growing significantly in. However, for this past quarter, we werevery encouraged with the Macintosh results. The iMac was very well-received andthe overall Macintosh had its best year-over-year performance in Japan in sevenquarters, with units up 14% year over year and that compared to an IDC estimateof the market in Japan contracting an additional 2%. So itâs a tough market.",1
"It is and as weâve said before, the holiday quarter isusually the big quarter for iPods and as I said, weâre shipping the best iPodsthat weâve ever made and are looking forward to the December quarter.",1
(Operator Instructions) Next weâll go to Shannon Cross ofCross Research.,1
Itâs done on a look-back basis.,1
"Sure. In the September quarter, our direct sales were 57% oftotal company revenue, and that was up from 53% in the year-ago quarter. Icanât give you a forecast for this December quarter, but last year in Q1,direct sales were 44% of total company revenue.",1
"Okay. All right, and then finally, I was hoping for clarificationon how your accounting for the iPhone rebate in the quarter? I know youmentioned it in the prepared remarks, but I --",1
"Sure. We are accounting for the credits as they are redeemedby customers and will charge the associated product costs to costs of goodssold. And as I indicate in my prepared remarks, we anticipate that most ofthese redemptions will occur by the end of the December quarter.",1
Next weâll go to David Bailey of Goldman Sachs.,1
"Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could help usunderstand your pricing strategy for iPhone in Europe,where the pricing is higher and effectively going up versus the U.S.price as the dollar weakens?",1
"We set our price in Europe, David, when we announced andthat price also includes VATs and other related duties.",1
"And then could you just follow-up and tell us what thepercentage of direct sales were in the quarter and maybe give us some idea ofwhat you are expecting for the December quarter, since this will be a drag ongross margin?",1
Next weâll go to Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.,1
"Well, Iâm not sure how to really answer the first part ofyour question, but in terms of the second part, generally for most U.S.companies, growth in foreign earnings is a benefit to your taxes, your U.S. taxrate.",1
KatyHuberty - Morgan Stanley,1
Thank you. Europe out grew the U.S. now for four quarters ina row. Is that sustainable or are there some currency factors that are showingup in the numbers?,1
"Europe did have excellent growth. In fact, year over year,we were up 37% in revenue and 47% in units, as you combine the retail storeswith the channel results.",1
"In terms of Mac units, this is over four times the IDCprojected gain for Western Europe, and so we are thrilled with the result.Europe did not have the typical lull in August that we have seen. The iMacannouncement and then followed by the iPod announcement early September wasenough to overcompensate for that.",1
We factored our view of the future into the guidance thatPeter provided earlier.,1
"And then just quickly, Peter, are there any nuances thatwill show up in the model as non-U.S. revenues become a larger percentage ofthe business, as it relates to either the margin profile or tax rate over time?",1
"Yes, cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion.",1
"Okay, thanks, guys.",1
"Thanks, Keith, and we have time for one final question.",1
Your next question will come from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.,1
"I think if you look at the Mac, there are two things that I believe impacted the Mac sales last quarter and possibly a third. The first is that U.S. K to 12 institutional sales were down 7% year-on-year to about 200,000 units, and this is due to state and local budget constraints. California in particular was down 28% year-on-year. That 7% contraction was a significant change from what we had seen in the first three quarters of the fiscal year which were up 29%. In particular, purchases of 1,000 units or more were down significantly, both sequentially and year over year.",1
"If the unit sales had grown last quarter in K to 12 at 29%, which is what we had been seeing going into the quarter instead of contracting by 7%, then Mac unit sales would have been 75,000 units higher and so this was a big issue for the quarter from a Mac perspective.",1
"The second thing that we believe was that customers were delaying purchases because of the portable transition. As you know, there were rampant rumors and lots of press reports about a potential portable transition and we saw some slowing towards particularly the final weeks of September and the initial weeks of October. However, once announcing last week, we saw a considerable rebound in sales and we are very, very optimistic about those results.",1
"Okay, and then just a final question for Steve -- any chance we can get you to make this a recurring event?",1
"Not likely, Iâm sorry.",1
Peter and Tim do such a good job that I donât think I could add much.,1
"Thanks for providing the non-GAAP results. Thatâs helpful and really points to the power that the iPhone is having and clearly you are off to a phenomenal start there but Steve, can you talk about the bigger picture for the iPhone in 2009 when the field is starting to get more cluttered with iPhone wanna-bes? And how do you just big picture think about your roadmap for â09 and the phone?",1
"In the Mac area, as Peter said in his opening comments, we began and ended the quarter between three and four weeks of inventory and thatâs below our target, as you know, of four to five weeks. In the iPod, we began and ended between four and six weeks, which is right in our target range and on the iPhone, we were shipping to carriers in 51 countries by the end of the quarter and we had over 30,000 points of distribution. With the 44 countries that we had launched prior to the end of August, the weeks of inventory that we had at the end of the quarter for those countries was less than six weeks. For the remaining seven countries where launches occurred in late September or early October, we donât have enough data yet to quantify the weeks of inventory. However, to be precise, at the end of the quarter I can tell you that we had about 2 million iPhones in total channel inventory across all of the 51 countries and we feel that this inventory is about right.",1
"Well, I think we have to be the best and I think we have to not leave a price umbrella underneath us, and we are working very hard to fulfill both of those goals. And I think we are way out ahead of anybody else right now and we are investing a lot with the most talented people in the world to stay that way.",1
"We have a great partner in AT&T and together I think we are both very committed to making the iPhone a great value for customers, so weâll be focused on all those things next year and beyond.",1
Okay. Can you give any sort of split in terms of phones sold in U.S. versus international?,1
"Not specifically, Gene, but I would tell you that there was a significant percentage international.",1
"Okay, and then just a final question -- Peter, last quarter you talked about the margin impact and the potential for these new products and it seems like margins once again were phenomenal and can you just help us understand, should we still be waiting for something or have we seen what happened and just the pricing environment was much more favorable than you had expected? How do we reconcile your comments last quarter versus what we are seeing right now?",1
"Gene, really the latter -- weâve introduced stunning new iPods and notebooks. They cost more and thatâs why our margin declined sequentially. As I told you 90 days ago, we donât talk about new products so it was hard to make the comments that I did and be clear, but youâve now seen what weâve done and I have provided guidance for 30% to 31% this quarter and we are going to continue to work to get down the cost curves over time on these great products.",1
"Okay, and Iâm curious -- any idea on how much the Mac refresh would have impacted sales last quarter as you sort of cleared the channel?",1
"A question with regard to channel inventory and what you are seeing in terms of -- I mean, iPod, iPhone, Macs, just comments from the retailers -- again, I know itâs October and as you said, itâs a bit foggy but any sort of thoughts on how things are positioned that you can give us, in more detail than maybe what you provided earlier?",1
"On the iPod side, iPod was up 8% for the full quarter, as Peter had mentioned earlier. In the final weeks of September and the early weeks of October, we were running flat year over year on a worldwide perspective and as we look forward, itâs very difficult to predict whether the usual seasonal holiday lift will exist in the same pattern as it has before. As we said, forecasting is very difficult.",1
"We would certainly sell our new MacBooks cheaper if we just delivered them with a block of aluminum but we have to machine that aluminum and itâs a fairly precision operation, so the cost of the aluminum matters some but is not a dominant cost.",1
"Thank you. Steve, thanks for being on the call. I would like to start off with a question regarding share repurchase and just ask your and the boardâs latest thoughts on share repurchase now. I understand that cash is a good thing to have in the current environment but you are using relatively little of that cash for things like retail store openings and for investments in the business. What are your thoughts on returning some to shareholders?",1
"You know, I think this economic downturn may present some extraordinary opportunities to companies that have cash. I think cash is already king and it may get more so that way, so we are very comfortable with our cash position in the bank and itâs not burning a hole in our pocket.",1
"Okay, thank you. And if I could follow-up, Peter, and maybe ask if you could give us a sense of how much of the gross margin outlook for the fourth quarter is related to the higher costs associated with the aluminum uni-body enclosures, and maybe some sense of how much more expensive that is then the way you were doing things previously?",1
"Well, the guidance that I provided, Rich, the sequential decline really is driven from the introductions of the notebooks and iPods, which we couldnât be more excited about. And thereâs many, many new technologies, new features in those besides the uni-body but that contributed.",1
"As I said on the last call, we were going to introduce these products. They were initially going to have higher costs and through volume manufacturing and cost engineering, weâre going to work down, work to get down the cost curve over time. But weâve made a big investment in these products and these are some of the best weâve ever shipped.",1
"Okay. Peter, could I ask one more -- and that is we have seen a 35% decline in aluminum pricing so far -- well, since you gave the guidance for fiscal â09 gross margin, aluminum is down 35%. How quickly can we expect that to start flowing through the P&L? Thank you.",1
"Your next question will come from Ben Reitzes, Barclays Capital.",1
Your next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"Thanks a lot. Steve, can you talk about the pricing of your Mac line right now and how you feel that is positioned going into this economy? And in particular as well, maybe your thoughts -- thereâs this new NetBook category thatâs getting a lot of hype and just where do you see that playing out in the marketplace and your position in the market there?",1
"Well, again this particular downturn is not creating a market of cheaper computers. That market has existed for some time and there are parts of that market that we choose not to play in.",1
"I think when people want a product of the class that we make, over and over again people have done the price comparisons and weâre actually quite competitive. So we choose to be in certain segments of the market and we choose not to be in certain segments of the market. And the question is is the downturn going to drive some of our customers to those lower segments of the marketplace and get to buy lesser products? And I will be surprised if that happens in large numbers and I actually think that there are still a tremendous number of customers that we donât have in the Windows world or in the other 99% of the phone market we donât have who would like to and can afford to buy Apple products. So weâll see what the ratio of those two things are but weâre not tremendously worried.",1
"As we look at the NetBook category, thatâs a nascent category. Thereâs as best as we can tell not a lot of them getting sold. You know, one of our entrants into that category, if you will, is the iPhone for browsing the Internet and doing e-mail and all the other things that a NetBook lets you do, and being connected via the cellular net wherever you are, an iPhone is a pretty good solution for that, and it fits in your pocket. But weâll wait and see how that nascent category evolves and weâve got some pretty interesting ideas if it does evolve.",1
"Okay, great, thanks and just a quick follow-up on the iPhone -- I mean, given itâs so new for you, Steve, do you have any view on how it will do in this economy, and in particular you still have some international expansion going on, so just given the iPhone is new, weâve been through downturns maybe with Macs before, although a long time ago, and maybe even consumer devices, this iPhone is so new, how do you see it doing in this economy?",1
Weâll be glad to tell you how it does.,1
Okay. I guess one final question is did you actually see a deceleration in your business? I know that there was some anticipation on the new Macs but did you see any sort of deceleration towards the end of September or is the guidance just purely trying to be as conservative as possible?,1
"On the Mac, I commented that we did see what we believe were purchasing delays due to last weekâs portable transition and also the K-12 institutional business was down year over year last quarter.",1
Weâre not economists and we read the same newspapers you do.,1
Your next question will come from Bill Fearnley with FTN Midwest.,1
"I just meant exactly what I said, which is I think thereâs going to be some significant opportunities. I think hiring every engineer is Silicon Valley is a good idea, though. Thanks.",1
"And then you had also mentioned the price umbrella statement and you said look, certainly to be successful on iPhone, we donât want to create a price umbrella. I think in response to another question, you also talked about extraordinary feature functionality in terms of your Mac products. Do you have the same philosophy around Mac as you do with iPhone, that you have to be careful not to create an umbrella in each? So I guess the simple question is should we continue to see more affordable price points across the Mac product family and across iPhone going forward?",1
"Well, I think what we want to do is deliver a lot, an increasing level of value to these customers. There are some customers which we choose not to serve. We donât know how to make a $500 computer thatâs not a piece of junk, and our DNA will not let us ship that. But we can continue to deliver greater and greater value to those customers that we choose to serve and thereâs a lot of them. And weâve seen great success by focusing on certain segments of the market and not trying to be everything to everybody. So I think you can expect us to stick with that winning strategy and continuing to try to add more and more value to those products in those customer bases we choose to serve. Does that make sense to you?",1
"Yes, it does. I mean, I guess, if I could follow-up, you did in this case add more value in terms of feature functionality with your notebook by actually lowering the price, so you retained the features but lowered the price. Certainly in terms of the new notebooks, you retained the price and added more features.",1
"Can we expect you to continue to attract more customers by doing both, both adding more features at the same price and lowering price and retaining the same features?",1
"Well, we like to attract new customers but you will just have to wait and see.",1
"If I could ask a question for Steve and then a quick follow-up to Peter and Tim -- Steve, how are you thinking about Apple TV now? Youâve had a heck of a year. For fiscal year, youâve upgrade the iPhone, the iPods, and certainly the Macintoshes as well. If you look at the digital living room category and you look at the upcoming year of 2009, how do you look at the digital living room opportunity and how it relates to Apple TV?",1
"Toni, I would point out, just to show the breadth of what weâve done, when we took Touch price down, we took it from $299 to $229 for the entry price and the units above it were moved $399 to $299 and $499 to $399, so significant price cuts on Touch. We also doubled the memory at the same price on Nano while providing an incredibly new design. Also on the notebooks, as you know from last week, the entry price went from $1099 to $999, and in addition, we brought MacBook Pro features down to the MacBook price range, which is essentially at $700 less than what we were offering before. And so weâve made an enormous round of cuts to provide more value to our customers.",1
"Well again, I think the whole category is still a hobby right now. I donât think anybody has succeeded at it and actually the experimentation has slowed down. A lot of the early companies that were trying things have faded away, so Iâd have to say that given the economic conditions, given the venture capital outlooks and stuff, I continue to believe it will be a hobby in 2009.",1
"And if I could switch quickly to tablet computing and touch screens, youâve made some comments about those in the past but when you look at tablet computing and you look at the new form factor for the Macs and those types of things, does that get to be a more attractive opportunity for you going forward here, now that the new Macs are out?",1
"I think we have such creative people that are looking at a lot of things but I really canât talk about any of the future products we are working on, Iâm sorry.",1
"Okay, and then -- thanks for that, and Peter, when you talk about your expectations for the upcoming quarter, whatâs your expectation for meeting or getting close to equilibrium from a demand and supply perspective here in the first quarter of â09, and are there any credit issues in the channel affecting your revenue projections for the upcoming quarter, either in the U.S. or other geos? So itâs a new product and itâs a credit issue question for the guidance in the first quarter.",1
"Bill, Iâll make a comment or two on the credit and Tim can speak about the first part of your question. You know, this is definitely a concerning environment from a credit perspective. Our treasury team has done just an amazing job with our cash. I was so proud to tell you in my opening comments that our mark-to-market, unrealized mark-to-market on the portfolio only increased $80 million sequentially on over $24 billion of cash, so theyâve done a great job.",1
"On the receivables side, weâve historically been very good in that area. Weâve got good people. We stay on top of collections and we monitor accounts, I think as any company does. But itâs a tough environment out there and we are being as careful as we can and hopefully we wonât have issues in the future.",1
"Thatâs a good segue for the two things I wanted to just clarify with Steve -- Steve, you mentioned a couple of times that you thought there were extraordinary opportunities for companies with cash. I think you could hire almost every engineer in Silicon Valley on a lifetime employment contract and not really dent that significant cash horde that you have. When you made that statement, are you suggesting that there are significant opportunities for Apple outside of Apple, specifically in terms of acquiring companies?",1
"We are going to continue with this strategy of delivering great products and making a reasonable margin but as Steve said, we are not going to leave an umbrella for competitors.",1
"Would it be safe to summarize your comments as that you have seen some sort of an impact, it looks like itâs more a slow-down ahead of the Mac cycle and so itâs less economy related and more just your general conservatism?",1
"Well, keep it up, Steve.",1
"Itâs difficult to separate how much was the purchase delay versus economy. It could have all been delay, it could be some part due to the economy. We just donât know. What we are very excited about is the rebound last week was great and -- however, forecasting that going forward with the visibility that we have is just very difficult.",1
Your next question will come from Charles Wolf with Needham.,1
"Yes, I have a question for Steve and for -- well, for anybody but the performance of the iPhone was absolutely astonishing, but it was probably more so in this respect that most of the phones sold in the quarter were probably net activations as opposed to re-upgrades from the first gen. I was wondering, do you have any percentages on how many of the iPhones went to new users and how many, what percentage went to the first gen people?",1
Thatâs confidential information to our carrier partners but I would point out that we expanded the number of countries that we sold in from six to 51 and so there was an extraordinary amount of iPhone being sold to people for the first time.,1
"Yes, well my point is simply that over half of RIMâs sales, BlackBerry sales, are upgrades, not to new users, so I would argue that Apple did better than it would appear, given the numbers.",1
Weâre happy just to -- weâre just happy to beat them on a number-to-number comparison.,1
Weâll try.,1
"In last quarterâs call, I said that we anticipated gross margin being about 30% in fiscal 2009 and our guidance for the December quarter is consistent with that at 30% to 31%. As we look forward, we continue to anticipate gross margins of about 30% in 2009. We are delivering state-of-the-art products at price points that our competitors canât match and thatâs resulting in market share gains in each of our product areas.",1
Your next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.,1
"Thank you. I have a question or two for Peter and Tim, and clarifications for Steve. For Peter and Tim, can you talk about the forces at work in terms of iPhone volumes for Q4? Typically, I mean, last year we saw iPhone volumes double in the calendar fourth quarter. You are also expanding distribution. Both of those are obviously forces that would suggest that the iPhone number could be considerably higher. Obviously on the flip side of that, you did have a stocking of your channel, which wonât be as significant in Q4, and we have economic uncertainty. Should investors be thinking about strong seasonal growth in the iPhone for calendar Q4? And if not, why?",1
"You know, we donât predict unit sales at a product level but what I would point out is that we did begin shipping in many more countries last quarter, from six to 51, as I had said, and we just launched the phone on July 11th, so we did have a channel build. That channel build was about 2 million units, as I had mentioned previously, and so thatâs something you would have to take into account in predicting our fiscal Q1 sales.",1
"We will expand into more countries. We are on target to be in over 70 by the end of the year. However, the countries that we are expanding in are clearly have -- thereâs less opportunity in those than the 50 that we have rolled out so far, and so youâd have to take that into consideration.",1
"We are confident that year over year that sales will be up significantly. What they do sequentially, our crystal ball is not working at the moment and so we would leave that for you to predict.",1
"And then on the gross margin side, you are guiding for 30% to 31% for Q1 and you said that you expect to be able to ride down the cost curve as volumes ramp going forward. How does that -- how should we think about your previously stated guidance of 30% gross margin for fiscal year 2009 in light of those two statements?",1
Your next question will come from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.,1
"Well, thereâs a lot of prudence in there but itâs also October and October has always been a little bit of a foggy month for us. You know, we are always biting our nails, wondering whether we ordered too many iPods or this or that for the holiday quarter because sales often donât really take off until November some time. So the months of October and April are our slowest during the year and we think we are doing the right things. We think we know what the results may be but October and April are foggy months for us in terms of predicting the whole quarter but thereâs a lot of prudence built in.",1
Weâll take our final question from Andy Hargreaves fromPacific Crest Securities.,1
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide added transparency to our business and hope they are helpful to you in your analysis and understanding of our performance during the September quarter.,1
"While our GAAP results provide significant insight into our performance, we are supplementing our analysis of the business internally by using non-GAAP financial measures that correspond to the total sales and product costs of iPhones and Apple TVs sold during the quarter. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide us with meaningful additional insight into the performance of our business, as well as provide information about iPhone and Apple TV that is similar to the information we use to analyze the performance of Macs and iPods.",1
"Beginning with this quarterâs earnings release, we plan to provide you quarterly with non-GAAP financial measures we use internally to help us evaluate our performance and make operating decisions. I encourage you to read the earnings press release as it provides a full description of these non-GAAP measures, including how we use them, how they are derived, and their limitations.",1
"I would now like to go through several of the non-GAAP measures. First, we use a non-GAAP measure that we call adjusted sales to provide more information regarding our underlying sales trends and to evaluate the sales dollars of products sold in the period. We calculated adjusted sales by backing out the September quarterâs amortization of deferred revenue from iPhone and Apple TV sales and adding back all amounts generally due at the time of sale for iPhones and Apple TVs shipped in the September quarter.",1
"Adjusted sales totaled $11.7 billion, which was about $3.8 billion higher than our reported revenue of $7.9 billion.",1
"Second, we use a non-GAAP measure we call adjusted cost of sales that corresponds to adjusted sales. We calculated adjusted cost of sales by backing out the September quarterâs amortization of deferred costs related to iPhone and Apple TV and adding back the total cost of the iPhones and Apple TVs shipped in the September quarter. We also used an estimate of the total future warranty expense related to the iPhones and Apple TVs sold in the September quarter rather than reflecting the actual iPhone and Apple TV warranty expenses incurred during the September quarter. We then calculated the non-GAAP measure of adjusted gross margin by subtracting adjusted cost of sales from adjusted sales. For the September quarter, adjusted gross margin was $4.6 billion, which was $1.8 billion higher than recorded gross margin.",1
"Third, we used the non-GAAP measure of adjusted net income to evaluate our performance based on the current period iPhone and Apple TV sales and to facilitate ongoing operating decisions. For the September quarter, adjusted net income was $2.4 billion, which was $1.3 billion higher than reported net income.",1
"Now turning to details of our results, I would like to begin with the iPhone, which had a breakout quarter, thanks to the July 11th launch of the iPhone 3G. We sold nearly 6.9 million iPhones during the September quarter, exceeding the 6.1 million units shipped over the entire lifetime of the first generation iPhone. And with more than two months to go in the calendar year, we have already surpassed our goal of 10 million iPhone sales in calendar 2008.",1
"In contrast, we generally recognize revenue and cost of sales for our other hardware products, such as Macs and iPods, at the time of sales as we do not provide new features or software applications for those products free of charge.",1
"Recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, iPhone accessories, and carrier payments totaled $806 million during the quarter. We dramatically expanded iPhone distribution in the last quarter. We increased the number of countries where we are selling iPhone from six to 51, and we expect to be in more than 70 countries by the end of the December quarter.",1
"With the addition of Best Buy, we have over 3,100 points of iPhone distribution in the U.S. and with our international expansion, we currently have over 30,000 points of distribution around the world.",1
"I would like to now talk about our Mac products and services. We are pleased to have shipped over 2.6 million Macs, which was a new company record for any quarter. This represents 21% year-over-year growth and is higher than the overall PC market rate of growth for the September quarter based on the latest estimate published by IDC.",1
"Although Mac sales grew faster than the market, we believe Mac growth was impacted by purchase delays based on speculation about the new launch of our portables and budgetary constraints affecting education institution purchases. We are unsure how the economy may have affected Mac sales in the quarter.",1
"And of course, we are very enthusiastic about the new notebooks introduced last week. The new MacBook and MacBook Pro redefined notebook design while dramatically lowering the entry price for advanced notebook features, including all metal enclosures, pro performance notebook graphics, brilliant instant on LED backlit displays, and new large glass multi-touch track-pads.",1
"Now Iâd like to discuss our music products and services. We sold 11 million iPods, a new record for a non-holiday quarter and an increase of 8% over the year-ago quarter. Last month we introduced our new line-up of iPods, including the fourth generation iPod Nano featuring a sleek new curved aluminum and glass design in nine great colors. We also introduced the second generation iPhone Touch, building on its groundbreaking original features while redefining the entry price of $229.",1
"As we reported in our press release, iPhone unit sales grew significantly in the September quarter, resulting in a material increase in the amount of iPhone revenue and product costs that had been deferred for recognition in future periods. Specifically, deferred revenue from iPhone and Apple TV sales grew to $5.8 billion at the end of the September quarter, an increase of nearly $3.8 billion from the end of the June quarter. If iPhone revenue was not deferred, iPhone would have represented 39% of Apple's revenue in the September quarter.",1
"As we have discussed in the past, because we may provide new features and software applications to iPhone and Apple TV customers in the future free of charge, in accordance with GAAP we use subscription accounting to recognize revenue and cost of sales for these products on a straight line basis over their two-year estimated economic lives. This results in the deferral of almost all revenue and cost of sales related to iPhone and Apple TV during the quarter in which these products are sold to customers.",1
"The iTunes store had a very good quarter thanks to the strong music and video sales and the tremendous success of the App Store. We now have over 65 million iTunes customer accounts and a music catalog of over 8.5 million titles, and we are very pleased with our fall 2008 TV lineup, which now includes primetime programming from all four major networks in stunning high definition.",1
That does conclude todayâs teleconference. We would like tothank you all for your participation and have a great day.,1
"Iâm just wondering if your strategy in terms of gettingvideo content on iTunes has changed, given the increase in available contentonline, and Iâm talking about different forms other than professional long-formcontent. Would you guys look to add new forms of content as we move forward?",1
"You know, Iâm not sure I completely understand yourquestion, but weâve got the largest library of content available in the worldfor sale to customers, more than 5 million songs, over 500 movies, and hundredsof TV shows. I think our store is unparalleled to anybody elseâs.",1
"Okay, and then on the rebates, if we could touch on thatreal quick; can you give us any qualitative or quantitative info on how much insales each $100 rebate has brought back? And then, what the percentage of thosethat have been redeemed are?",1
"Sorry, those are not details that we are going to get into.I think customers have really appreciated the $100 credit that weâve offeredthem and as Iâve said a couple of times this afternoon, we expect most people toredeem by the end of the December quarter.",1
"Thank you, Andy, and apologize for all the technicaldifficulties. A replay of todayâs call will be available as a podcast on theiTunes store, as a webcast on Apple.com/investor, and via telephone, and thenumber for the telephone replay is 719-457-0820, the confirmation code is4434584. And these replays will be available beginning at approximately 5:00p.m. Pacific Time today.",1
Members of the press with additional questions can contactSteve Dowling at 408-974-1896. Financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or mewith additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570 and Iâm at 408-974-5420.Thanks again for joining us.,1
"Good day and welcome to this Apple Incorporated Apple fourth quarter fiscal year 2008 conference call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.",1
"Net income was $1.14 billion, which was up 26% over the prior September quarterâs results and translated to earnings per share of $1.26.",1
Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us.,1
"Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, and earnings per share. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2007, the Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2008, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release.",1
"And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the our September quarter results, which were record-breaking on a number of fronts. First, we sold more Macs than we have in any other quarter in Apple's history. Second, we sold more iPhones in the September quarter than in all previous quarters combined. Third, we sold more iPods than in any prior non-holiday quarter and finally, we generated more revenue and earnings than in any previous September quarter in Apple's history.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $7.9 billion, representing 27% growth and an increase of $1.68 billion over the previous September quarterâs revenue of $6.22 billion.",1
"Operating margin for the quarter was better than expected at 18.3%, due to higher-than-anticipated gross margin.",1
"Both iPods incorporate the new iTunes 8 Genius technology, which automatically creates playlists from songs in usersâ libraries that go great together with just one click. We remain very pleased with iPod market share. Our share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the month of September based on the latest data published by NPD, and we continued to gain share year over year in most international markets, including the U.K., France, Germany, Japan, Canada, and Australia, based on the latest data published by GFK and BCN.",1
"I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which delivered strong results with revenue growing 37% year over year to $1.72 billion. The store sold 596,000 Macs during the quarter, an all-time quarterly record and an increase of 26% year over year. Over half the Macs sold through the retail stores during the quarter were to customers who have never owned a Mac before.",1
"Thank you. Steve, clearly your results and the guidance paint two very different pictures of the world and I was wondering, have you seen any new trends in recent business that would suggest such a disparity or is this really simply just prudence, given all the macro headlines we are all seeing right now?",1
"First, we have the best customers in the world. I wouldnât trade our customers for any other companyâs customers in the entire world. They are some of the smartest, most product aware customers in the market and they have chosen Apple's quality, hardware and software products. While they may postpone purchases in tough times, they are unlikely to abandon the quality and seamless integration which they have personally experienced and become accustomed to with Apple's products. So if the economic downturn does affect them, they are more likely to delay than switch.",1
"But even more remarkable is this -- measured by revenues, Apple has become the worldâs third-largest mobile phone supplier. I know this sounds crazy, but itâs true -- as measured in revenues, not units, Apple has become the third largest mobile phone supplier. Letâs look at the ranking -- Nokia is clearly number one at 12.7 billion; Samsung number two at 5.9 billion; Apple is number three at 4.6 billion; Sony Ericsson, number four at 4.2; LG, number five at 3.4 billion; Motorola, number six at 3.2; and RIM number seven at 2.1. Pretty amazing.",1
"Now, both of these things, beating RIM in units and becoming the third largest mobile supplier in revenues are amazing feats but part of this was the result of expanding into over 50 countries and thereâs no guarantee that sustained sales will equal initial sales. And who knows what the future results will be, given the worldwide economic slowdown but we actually outsold RIM last quarter and ranked as the third largest mobile phone supplier in revenues. Not bad for being in the market for only 15 months.",1
"I would now like to talk about the App Store for a few minutes. One area that where we have completely changed the value proposition for mobile devices is the App Store. Customers will download the 200 millionth application from the App Store tomorrow, only 102 days since its launch on July 11th -- the 200 millionth app. Weâve never seen anything like this in our careers. There are now over 5,500 applications offered on the App Store in 62 countries around the world and the rate of new applications being submitted is increasing every week. Competitors are scrambling to copy our App Store but itâs not as easy as it looks and we are far along in creating the virtuous cycle of cool applications begetting more iPhone sales, thereby creating an even larger market which will attract even more iPhone software development. It is clear that customers are now attracted to iPhone not only for its amazing functionality and revolutionary multi-touch user interface but also for its unique ability to let users easily purchase, download, and use thousands of different applications, ranging from free games to financial planning and health management -- all of this in only 102 days.",1
"And now Iâd like to touch on the notebooks that we just introduced. Last week we introduced our new MacBook and MacBook Pro line. These products are very important since notebooks comprise two-thirds or more of the Macs we sell. These new MacBooks are some of the best products weâve ever created and itâs already clear that our customers love them. Weâve had a very, very strong launch and we are anxiously awaiting to see the demand trajectory that will unfold during the quarter. The level of quality these products deliver to customers is mind-blowing for their price points. The unibody precision aluminum enclosures would normally cost hundreds of dollars by themselves. The electronics, especially the graphics, are state-of-the-art in mobile computing and features like the glass track pad are unique in the industry. With the introduction of LED backlit displays on these mainstream notebooks, over 90% of the notebooks Apple sells now use LED backlit displays.",1
Another thing worth noting is that these new notebooks are the greenest products Apple has ever offered. You will hear more and more about that from us in the future.,1
"So now letâs turn to the economy, to the broader market conditions resulting from the global economic slowdown and credit crisis. First, let me say that we are not economists. Your next-door neighbor can likely predict what is going to happen as accurately as we can, but we do know a few things.",1
"Two, we still have a minority market share of the PC market and a miniscule market share of the mobile phone market. While we may not appeal to every prospective customer, the percentage of prospective customers we need to attract in order to significantly increase our market share isn't that many and we have 250 Apple retail stores that already sell half their Macs to new-to-Mac customers.",1
"As you can see, the non-GAAP financial results are truly stunning. By eliminating subscription accounting, adjusted sales for the quarter were $11.68 billion, 48% higher than the reported revenue of $7.9 billion, while adjusted income was $2.44 billion, 115% higher than the reported net income of $1.14 billion. Adjusted net income that is more than double our reported income -- if this isn't stunning, I donât know what is, all due to the incredible success of the iPhone 3G.",1
"Three, we have the best product lineup in Apple's history. The new MacBooks in particular should trigger a serious upgrade cycle in our installed base. Weâll see. I feel very good about our product lineup as we head into the holidays and beyond.",1
"Four, we have the most talented and creative employees in the world -- just look at their results -- the new MacBooks, the iMac, the iPhone, the iPod Nano and Touch, Leopard, iLife, and on and on. None of our competitors can deliver products in this class.",1
"And five, we have almost $25 billion safely in the bank and zero debt. This provides us tremendous stability and the ability to invest our way through this downturn. This is what we did during the last downturn -- we increased R&D investments and created some of our best new products and businesses, like the Apple retail stores, for one. This downturn may also present some extraordinary opportunities for companies that have the cash to take advantage of them, like Apple does.",1
"In summary, we have the strongest product lineup in Apple's history, the most talented employees, and the best customers and $25 billion in the bank. We may get buffeted around by the waves a little bit but we will be fine and stronger than ever when the water is calm in the future.",1
"With that, Iâd like to open it up for questions for Peter, Tim, or myself.",1
(Operator Instructions) And your first question will come from Bill Shope with Credit Suisse.,1
"I would like to now highlight two remarkable milestones resulting from iPhoneâs outstanding performance last quarter. The first is that Apple beat RIM. In their most recent quarter, Research in Motion, or RIM, reported selling 6.1 million BlackBerry devices. Compared to our most recent quarter sales of 6.9 million iPhones, Apple outsold RIM last quarter and this is a milestone for us. RIM is a good company that makes good products and so it is surprising that after only 15 months in the market, we could outsell them in any quarter.",1
"Because by its nature subscription accounting spreads the impact of iPhoneâs contribution to Apple's overall sales, gross margin, and net income over two years, it can make it more difficult for the average Apple manager or the average investor to evaluate the companyâs overall performance. As long as our iPhone business was small relative to our Mac and music businesses, this didnât really matter much. But this past quarter, as you heard, our iPhone business has grown to about $4.6 billion, or 39% of Apple's total business, clearly too big for Apple management or investors to ignore. Hence our introduction today of non-GAAP financial results alongside our reported GAAP results.",1
"We opened 31 new stores during the quarter, including 13 stores outside the U.S. to end the quarter with 247 stores. With an average of 226 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $7.6 million, compared to $6.6 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 15%. Retail segment margin was $301 million, compared to $268 million in the year-ago quarter.",1
"We will continue our practice of providing guidance based on GAAP and will report our December non-GAAP measures to you in January when we release our results. We enter this holiday quarter with the best products weâve ever shipped, including the iPhone 3G and new notebooks and iPods, and we remain very confident in our business.",1
"Our stores hosted a new all-time high of 42.7 million visitors during the September quarter, or 14,500 visitors per store per week. We have continued to invest in our stores to accommodate this record-breaking traffic and to offer customers a great experience. We recently launched the fastest way to buy an iPhone, which customers are loving. After starting the process by answering a few questions online, customers can complete their iPhone purchase and activations in our stores in just about a minute longer than it takes to purchase an iPod.",1
"Total company gross margin was 34.7%, which was better than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, due primarily to a better component pricing environment. To a lesser degree, we also benefited from higher software sales and payments from carriers related to first generation iPhone and lower costs associated with the iPod product transition.",1
"Operating expenses were $1.3 billion, including $120 million in stock-based compensation expense. The OpEx total was about $30 million higher than our guidance, largely as a result of additional advertising and the operating costs of selling 6.9 million iPhones.",1
"OI&E was $140 million. The tax rate for the quarter was 28.2%, below our guidance of 30.5% due largely to a higher-than-anticipated mix of foreign earnings.",1
"We are very pleased to have generated $3.7 billion in cash during the quarter, ending with $24.5 billion. Cash flow from operations was $4.3 billion. Our investment priority has been preservation of capital, which has served us well in these difficult credit markets. At the end of the September quarter, our unrealized mark-to-market loss was $117 million on the total portfolio of $24.5 billion, which was only an $80 million sequential increase from the end of the June quarter. We plan to hold these investments and do not expect to realize any material losses on them.",1
"Looking ahead to the December quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"Our visibility is low and our forecasting is challenging and as a result, we are going to be prudent in predicting the December quarter. We are providing a wide range for our guidance for the quarter and we are targeting revenue between $9 billion and $10 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 30% and 31%, reflecting approximately $25 related to stock-based compensation expense, down from 34.7% gross margin in the September quarter. The sequential decline of our gross margin reflects the recent introductions of the new iPods and notebooks.",1
"I would like to go back and talk about the non-GAAP financial results because I think this is a pretty big deal. In addition to reporting an outstanding quarter, today we are also introducing non-GAAP financial results which eliminate the impact of subscription accounting. As you know, subscription accounting is the solution we adopted to let us provide free software updates to iPhone users under GAAP accounting rules. In accordance with the subscription accounting treatment required by GAAP, Apple recognizes the revenue and the cost of goods sold for the iPhone over its economic life of two years rather than upon sale as we do for Macs and iPods.",1
"We expect OpEx to be between $1.45 billion and $1.47 billion, including about $150 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $140 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 30.5%.",1
We are targeting EPS between $1.06 and $1.35.,1
"In closing, we are extremely pleased with the performance of our business during fiscal 2008. We generated nearly $32.5 billion in revenue, a 35% increase from 2007, and we gained market share globally in Macs, iPods, and iPhones. We are also pleased to have generated $9.1 billion in cash during the fiscal year.",1
"We are headed into the holiday season with our best product lineup ever and we are very enthusiastic about our expanding geographic reach with iPhone 3G. We remain very focused on developing the industryâs most innovative products, managing our business, and gaining share in each of our markets.",1
"Before we open the call to questions, we have a special guest here today who would like to say a few words and answer some of your questions -- our CEO, Steve Jobs.",1
"Hi, everyone. Some remarkable things are happening at Apple but everything is now set against the backdrop of this global economic slowdown, so it seemed like a good time for me to make a few remarks and help answer some of your questions.",1
"We exited the September quarter with great momentum. Macshipments exceeded our previous quarterly record by 400,000 systems and weârevery excited about the arrival of Leopard later this week. We introduced anentirely new lineup of iPods last month and customer reaction has been verystrong.",1
"We expect to generate EPS of about $1.42, including ananticipated $0.07 per share related to stock-based compensation.",1
"We more than doubled the size of our capital return program to a $100 billion, including the largest share repurchase authorization in history and we become one of the largest dividend payers in the world.",1
"We expect op-ex to be about $1.165 billion, including about$80 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about$195 million and we expect the tax rate to return to about 32%.",1
"Based on our latest survey, over 50% of the customers buying Macs in our stores were new to the Mac. Applying that rate to the quarter's results, we estimate that the average store added about 1,000 new Mac customers during the quarter.",1
"Over 20 million people visited the stores during the quarter, and customers attended over 125,000 personal training sessions.",1
"Our education channel had an outstanding quarter, selling a record number of Macs, driving 20% year-over-year growth. We are particularly pleased with this growth, which is significantly greater than IDC's most recently published forecast for the U.S. education market for the quarter. It was the most successful back-to-school quarter ever for our higher ed business, where shipments of Mac portables increased 49% year over year. This result was due in large part to the popularity of the MacBook in higher ed, as well as our very successful back-to-school promotion.",1
"In terms of geographic results, including sales from our retail stores, quarterly revenue in the Americas, Europe, and Japan was up 33%, 27%, and 26% respectively.",1
"Preliminary gross margin was 29.2% on a GAAP basis, about 80 basis points higher than our guidance, primarily due to product mix. Included in GAAP cost of goods sold was $5 million of stock-based compensation expense.",1
"Preliminary GAAP operating expenses were $803 million, including $34 million in expense related to stock-based compensation. Op-ex was about $17 million higher than guidance, primarily due to higher-than-expected revenue.",1
"OI&E was $113 million, about $13 million higher than guidance, largely due to higher-than-expected cash balances and higher-than-expected yields on cash investments.",1
"The tax rate for the quarter was about 24%, below our guidance of 32%, due to a one-time credit resulting from the settlement of prior-year tax audits in the United States, and proportionately higher-than-anticipated operating income from foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.",1
"We had a very strong cash generation during the quarter, increasing our cash balance by $934 million, to end with over $10.1 billion. This was primarily a function of strong earnings and working capital management.",1
"Looking ahead to the December quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which excludes the impact of any restatement and includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"For the quarter, we are targeting revenue between $6 billion and $6.2 billion.",1
"We expect total quarterly costs of non-cash, stock-based compensation to be approximately $45 million.",1
"We expect GAAP gross margin to be about 28.25%, reflecting approximately $6 million related to stock-based compensation expense.",1
"We expect GAAP op-ex to be about $905 million to $920 million, including about $39 million related to stock-based compensation expense.",1
"We expect OI&E to be about $120 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 32%.",1
"The stores sold a record 323,000 Macs during the quarter, representing 60% year-over-year growth.",1
"We opened 10 new stores during the September quarter, ending with 165. With an average of 158 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $5.9 million.",1
"The Apple retail stores posted very strong results. Revenue for the quarter was $936 million, up 41% year over year, and segment operating profit was $50 million. For the full year, revenue from the stores increased by over $1 billion, and average revenue per store grew to almost $24 million.",1
"The strong growth in Mac sales was largely due to unprecedented demand for our portable products, with sales of nearly 1 million units, representing 61% of all Macs sold during the quarter.",1
"Actual results and trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2005, the Form 10-Q for the first and second fiscal quarters of 2006, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report very strong preliminary results for the fourth quarter, and the best Mac shipments by far in any quarter in Apple's history.",1
"The quarter's revenue was $4.84 billion, representing 32% year-over-year growth. The strong revenue was fueled by robust sales of our Mac portable products, a successful back-to-school season, and the continued popularity of our music products.",1
"Preliminary operating margin for the quarter was 12.6%, and preliminary net income was $546 million, or $0.62 per diluted share on a GAAP basis.",1
"I would like to talk first about our Mac products, which represented 58% of our total quarterly revenue. We shipped a total of 1.61 million Macs, significantly greater than the previous quarterly record of 1.38 million Macs sold in the first quarter of Apple's fiscal 2000.",1
"Our September quarter Mac shipments grew 30% over the prior year, which is more than three times IBC's latest published market growth projections for the quarter. We believe this growth rate is particularly remarkable, given the tough comparison to the prior year's September quarter, which was up 48% year over year.",1
Ending channel inventory of Macs was below our target range of four to five weeks.,1
"The iPod ecosystem continues to thrive, with over 3,000 accessory products currently available. We estimate that over 70% of the 2007 model year cars sold in the U.S. will offer direct iPod integration as an option.",1
"With our Mac Pro launch in August, we have transitioned all of our Macs to the Intel architecture in nine months. We are extremely pleased with our team's speed and skill in executing this complex transition, and our developers continue to make great progress as well.",1
"There are over 4,000 universal applications available today and we estimate that by the end of December, 80% of the 500 Mac applications we consider most important to our customers will be available in universal versions.",1
"Our music products generated another quarter of strong results, representing 42% of total company revenue and increasing 36% year over year. iPod shipments grew 35% year over year, to $8.73 million, bolstered by the announcement of our new iPods on September 12th, and our very popular back-to-school promotion.",1
"Reviews of the new iPods have been very positive, and we are very confident in our new line-up, despite increased competition this holiday season.",1
Channel inventory of iPods as of the end of the quarter was within our target range of four to six weeks on a look-back basis.,1
"The iTunes store continues to be the world's leading online music store, and now offers movies in addition to over 3.5 million songs, 220 television programs, 9,000 music videos, and 20,000 audiobooks. Based on the latest data available from Nielsen SoundScan, iTunes accounts for 85% of songs purchased and downloaded in the U.S.",1
"We expect to generate GAAP EPS of about $0.70 to $0.73, including an anticipated $0.03 per share related to non-cash, share-based compensation expense.",1
"In closing, we are very proud of our accomplishments of the company in fiscal 2006. We sold over 5.3 million Macs, representing our best year ever, and we reached new heights with iPod shipments, selling more than 39 million.",1
"We generated $19.3 billion in revenue, representing 39% year-over-year growth, and we have added $11 billion in top-line growth in the last two years. We skillfully executed an incredibly complex architecture transition, converting our entire Mac line to Intel microprocessors in nine months.",1
"Andy, on the Japan side, when you combine the channel results with our retail store results, Macintosh units on a year-over-year basis declined by 10%. The market in Japan is among the weakest in the world and IBC was also expecting a contraction during the quarter.",1
"Lastly, inventory and receivables went up. Was that in line with your expectations? Looks like channel inventory is okay, but what about those two lines? What are you preparing for the on the inventory line, or what does it say about the linearity of the quarter on the AR side?",1
"In terms of inventory, it was up about $100 million year-over-year. We've opened 41 stores this year. Virtually all of the increase in inventory is in the retail stores to serve customers. As it relates to accounts receivables, they were up a little over $350 million, but as I said in my prepared remarks, in the last two years, we've added $11 billion in top line growth. The DSO performance was very strong in the quarter at 24 days.",1
All right. So the inventory was due to increased stores and getting ready for the holidays?,1
Your next question comes from Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns.,1
"Two things. Just a point of clarification. Japan, the CPUs were down. Can you give us background on what's going on in Japan? Second, to the extent you can talk about with the ongoing investigation, can you give us some sense about the role that you've clarified that Steve Jobs may have in this options investigation?",1
"As we reported about two weeks ago in our release, the special committee of Apple's board with its independent advisors reported their key findings. One of which was that the investigation found no misconduct by any member of Apple's current management team, and that includes Steve.",1
"However, having said that, we're not pleased with our performance there and we've got a number of activities underway to attempt to improve them. I would point out that despite the reduction in the Macintosh area that from a year-over-year point of view, revenue was up 26% in Japan on strong iPod sales.",1
"So you would expect that to pick up quite a bit into the holidays, normal seasonality? Nothing special to --",1
"That's what I was trying to understand, because the CPUs were down, but the revenues were up strongly so I was trying to clarify that.",1
"Yes, and that's due to strong iPod sales.",1
"Okay, Tim. Thanks very much.",1
That will come from Bill Shope - JP Morgan.,1
"Great, thanks. Can you guys give us an update on the progress you're seeing in the international markets with the iPod as you did last quarter? Then on the iTunes side, do the video sales have similar economics to music sales, as you've said in the past, or is this changing as U.S. scales the video business?",1
"Bill, we don't report individual product gross margins, but we're running the music store at above breakeven levels. Our view continues to be that selling music and TV shows and now movies helps us to sell iPod and accessories.",1
"Not providing a quantitative forecast, but qualitatively, seasonally, and with album releases, we have seen that in the past.",1
"Ben, in the quarter, it was relatively flat sequentially, but up over 70% year-over-year. In the quarter, we reduced our channel inventory on the Apple-branded iPod accessories in advance of our announcements on September 12th, so that played into it. Also, the summer is usually not the best quarter for music sales. People are on vacation and it generally is not the strongest quarter for new album releases either.",1
We remain committed to innovation and we are very enthusiastic about our product pipeline.,1
"Rich, as I said in my prepared remarks, the gross margin declined by about 110 basis points in the September quarter from the June quarter, which was actually less than what we had guided down. We had guided down closer to 200 basis points. The reason for this difference was primarily a better mix of higher margin products.",1
(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from David Bailey - Goldman Sachs.,1
"Great, thank you very much. Two short questions, please. Can you help us understand the impact of the lower price points associated with the new iPods are going to have on your blended ASP and gross margin for the December quarter? Just a follow-up, the component environment has been very favorable the past few quarters, can you give us your outlook on the remainder of the year for your component prices?",1
"David, I'll start with the iPod questions and Tim can discuss the component environment. As a result of the price reductions that we took on September 12th and the introduction of the new $79 Shuffle, we believe that our ASPs and iPods will be down in the December quarter from what they were in September, but we are very excited about the line that we just announced and are looking forward to the holiday season and confident.",1
"David, in the notebook hard drive area, we expect that since supply exceeds demand in this area, there'll be favorable pricing. For DRAM, NAND Flash, and LCD panels, demand trailer exceeds supply due to the usual seasonal demands. We expect other commodities to decline consistent with historical trends.",1
That will come from Richard Gardner - Citigroup.,1
"Thank you very much. I had two questions. One, I was hoping, Peter, you could give us the typical walkthrough on the pluses and minuses for gross margins in the fourth quarter. Secondly, was hoping you could give us a status update on your retail pilots with incremental retail customers?",1
"Actually, Peter, could you give us the same walkthrough for the December quarter?",1
"I guess with regard to a couple of other things. With regard to other music, that line was a little below expectations while virtually every other line was much better than expected. Is there something going on with download habits, Peter or Tim, and can you elaborate there? Should that line pick up with the addition of movies?",1
For the December quarter? Sure. Guiding margin down about a point as a result of the quarter having much higher iPod and other music product sales and also having a full quarter of the lower iPod pricing.,1
"Rich, in terms of expanding distribution on the Macintosh, as you know, we've had a pilot going by in seven stores. We've just concluded this week to expand that during this quarter to over 50. The stores are located around the country, and they will be selling both desktops and notebooks as well as some Mac software and accessories. We'll continue to evaluate how the program is going over the next several months to conclude what the next step should be. We're also running a small pilot with Circuit City which we really just started and there's no data available. But we will obviously monitor that and conclude what to do with that in the future.",1
All right. Thanks a lot.,1
That will come from Bill Richards - UBS.,1
"Good afternoon, thanks. So Steve says in this release that 2007 will be one of the most exciting product years in the history of Apple. Does that mean we should all show up for MacWorld? What does that mean versus 2006? Any other comments?",1
"Ben, as you know, we don't comment on our product road map in terms of specifics, but we are very confident of what we have in the pipeline and very excited that our customers will be pleased with it.",1
"Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today may consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, earnings per share, future products, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and the likely restatement of historical financial results pending the determination of appropriate accounting treatment for Apple's historical stock option granting practices.",1
"Though preliminary, we are providing this information today as we believe it is in investor's best interests that we present current results and the related trends of the business.",1
"Today, we are releasing preliminary results of Apple's fourth fiscal quarter. As our press release indicates, these results may be subject to significant adjustment due to the likely restatement of historical results that we have previously disclosed.",1
"Tim, you cited growth in Apple apps in the past, and clearly, the privacy policies you've taken have really reshaped the mobile ad market. Can you give us a sense of how you see Apple's role as an ad network and perhaps helping developers to monetize not just app sales but also growing ad monetization over time?",1
"And we continue to execute across some significant geographies where there's a very low penetration of iPhone. Some of those were called out in the opening remarks between Indonesia and Vietnam and India, where we did quite well, and iPhone tends to be the engine for those markets, particularly at the beginning of creating the market there for Apple products. And so we're really looking at all of these things from the installed base to the number of switchers to the geographic distribution.",1
"Of course, the most important thing for us is to maintain an incredible customer satisfaction and loyalty from the customers. And we're really pleased that it's currently at 98% for the latest iPhones. And so those are the things that underpin it. 5G has been an accelerant. And the 5G penetration, particularly if you look at it globally, is still quite low. In some geographies, it's obviously higher, but around the world, 5G penetration is still low. And so I think there's reason to be optimistic.",1
"Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe, Luca, for you. As we move from the June to the September quarter, maybe can you dig a level deeper and kind of help us understand some of the moving pieces in the Services business? Meaning where do you think we could see an acceleration or maybe a deceleration? And should we still expect double-digit growth? If you could just frame that for us, that would be great.",1
"Yes, Erik. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we expect some deceleration from the 12% that we've had in the June quarter. Keep in mind, we're going to see, on a year-over-year basis, 600 basis points, 6% impact from foreign exchange so that is a big element for us. Also keep in mind that we're still lapping the impact of our business in Russia in these numbers.",1
"And Tim mentioned that there are some pockets of weakness, primarily in digital advertising that we will need to work through. But at the same time, our Services business a year ago grew a lot and so also the compare is a bit challenging. So we don't have a very specific number to give out today. Of course, we expect to grow. We will see how the quarter develops.",1
We'll take our next question from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.,1
"Yes. Richard, we view privacy as a fundamental human right. And so what we try to do with all of our features on privacy is put the decision back at the user where we believe it belongs as to whether they want to share their data or not. And so that was what was behind application tracking transparency and a number of other features. We're trying to empower the user to own their data and make their own choices.",1
"I have two as well. Maybe Tim, if I start with you, I think there's a debate in the market that if you look back over time, there's been a 3-year cadence to iPhone cycles. We're 2 years into your 5G iPhone evolution. You're on track to grow units in '21 and '22. That implies there could be some pressure next year as upgrade rates slow. But your comments really suggest no slowdown. You're seeing double-digit growth in customers new to iPhone. So can you just walk us through some of the various factors you believe are driving this continued iPhone strength? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"In terms of us selling ads, we have a search ad business across the App Store that we believe represents a great way for discovery for small and large developers. And so I see that we play a role in that.",1
"And then maybe my follow-up for Luca. Can you give us a sense, especially now that you're launching Pay Later, what steps you might be taking to improve affordability of Apple products? We know that it's going to be a tight time economically for people around the world. And how do you see the evolution of various payment plans out of the -- you see in the U.S. now into other markets, especially emerging markets?",1
"Yes. I mean, obviously, affordability is a very important topic for us. It's been for many years. Buy now, pay later is the latest that we are doing on this front. Fundamentally, we are working on 2 major initiatives for affordability. One is installment plans and installment plans have become more widespread around the world, not only here in the United States but in most markets, particularly in emerging markets. Incredibly important in terms of reducing the affordability threshold.",1
"And trading programs. Trading programs are available in a number of markets. We can do better in other markets. They're incredibly important because the residual value of our products is a huge differentiator for our users. After they use our devices, they can bring them back and they retain much more value than other platforms. And therefore, it's important for us to raise that awareness. And so we will continue to expand those programs around the world. So installments and trade-ins, very, very important on affordability.",1
We'll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS.,1
I just wanted to circle back on sort of the macro and sort of the demand signals that you're seeing versus sort of the supply chains that you're facing. I know that there's been a couple of U.S. carriers that have talked about some of their customers having some difficulty paying bills. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you saw sort of the record number of switchers in the quarter. So just wanted to kind of get a sense for what you're seeing in that particular channel without naming a specific customer. And are you seeing any sort of issues from a spin-down effect maybe because customers are having some difficulty because of inflation? And then I have a follow-up on Macs.,1
"Today, the product and the innovation within the product that is driving it. And of course, the other key variables are some things that Luca mentioned earlier where the size of the installed base has been growing significantly. We also, just in this quarter, the June quarter, set a June quarter record for switchers with strong double-digit growth. And so this is fueling the additional installed base even more.",1
We'll take our next question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Great. And then on the Mac business, I know that you are severely supply chain constrained. But is there a way to kind of think about the impact of the market overall on the Mac business versus the supply chain? It sounds like -- I guess, it sounds like it's almost effectively 100% supply chain constrained, but we're obviously hearing, like I'm sure you guys are seeing, anecdotal evidence and some quantifiable evidence that the broader PC market is slowing.",1
"When you then look at Services, there were some Services that were impacted, for example, like digital advertising was clearly impacted by the macroeconomic environment. And so it's a mixed bag in terms of what we believe that we saw. Overall, we are very happy with the results. And when you think about the number of challenges in the quarter, we feel really good about the growth that we put up for the quarter.",1
"I guess two from my side. Maybe to start on the gross margin discussion, Luca. You said that implying gross margin will be down I think, 130, 140 basis points sequentially and down a bit year-over-year as well in September. Maybe just what are the puts and takes here. And then very specifically, can you actually just call what the FX headwinds are embedded in the September quarter gross margin, that would be helpful.",1
"Yes, Amit. We're guiding 41.5% to 42.5%. On a sequential basis, the decline is expected to be driven by, as you mentioned, foreign exchange but also mix, which will be partially offset by better leverage. We expect foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis to be 50 basis points.",1
"If you look at it from a year-over-year standpoint, we are in the ballpark of a year ago in spite of the fact that foreign exchange is going to be 130 basis points negative to a year ago. So clearly, foreign exchange is something that is affecting us but we think we're navigating that fairly well.",1
"Fair enough. And then if I could just ask Tim the question. There's a lot of macro worries and high inflation impacting consumer demand. Certainly doesn't seem to be very visible in your performance and your expectations. So I'm wondering if you talk about, are you seeing any implications from recession fears or inflation fears to your end demand? And really just related to that, wearables decline was notable. Is that where you would typically see initial signs of consumer softening perhaps?",1
"Thanks for the question. If you -- I'm not an economist and so I'll sort of narrow my comments to what we saw in the business. And if you look at the June quarter, we do believe that we saw macroeconomic headwinds that impacted our business and our results. And so one of those is clearly the FX, which Luca has mentioned, that was over 300 basis points on year-over-year growth rates.",1
"When you look at the product categories, on iPhone, there was no obvious evidence of macroeconomic impact during the June quarter besides FX, obviously. Mac and iPad were so gated by supply that we didn't have enough product to test the demand. And Wearables, Home and Accessories, as you mentioned and as Luca mentioned, we did see some impact there that we would attribute to a macroeconomic environment.",1
"Yes. First of all, congratulations. As these are tough times, you guys are putting up tremendous results so we appreciate that as investors. My question is, when I look at your Services business, I see a $20 billion business on a quarterly basis. And you keep adding -- as a company, you keep adding very interesting and transformative features such as payments, something like that every year.",1
"We always look and we ask ourselves if it's -- how strategic it is, and we never buy just to buy or buy just for revenue purposes. But we would buy something that is strategic for us. To date, we have concentrated on smaller IP and people acquisitions. But I wouldn't rule anything out for the future, and obviously, we are constantly surveilling the market.",1
"So I'm struggling to find a good way to think about how to model the growth of this business, considering that you add innovative features. So now that it's fairly matured as a business, what would be a good way for us to think about as investors to model the Services business? And I do have a follow-up.",1
"Well, as you know, we don't provide guidance past the current quarter. But I think the way to think about it, certainly the way we think about it is that there's a number of levers in our Services business to take into account. The first one is installed base. Installed base is the engine for our company and it continues to grow. As I mentioned, it has reached an all-time high across every geographic segment, across every product category. And so that's very important.",1
"Then the second lever is the customer engagement. And we know that our customers are getting more and more engaged over time. Transacting accounts, paid accounts, paid subscriptions are growing, so the level of engagement continues to grow.",1
"And then as you mentioned, the breadth and the quality of the services that we offer tends to grow over time. So these are all things that tend to help us over the long term. If you go back and you look at our growth rates over a number of quarters now, they've always been very good. Of course, the macro environment can have an impact on this business. Tim has mentioned, for example, digital advertising can be affected at times.",1
"During COVID, some of the compares have been a bit lumpy because there have been lockdowns and reopenings and so on. So it's very difficult to talk about a steady state growth rate for our Services business. But when we look at the entirety of what we are doing in the Services space, we feel very good about the future of the business.",1
"Luca, very helpful. And for my follow-up, valuations have come down in the last 18 months or so for things and companies and targets that you might look at. I guess, particularly in the Services area, would there be an appetite on behalf of Apple to accelerate the growth of its Services business by looking at external products to acquire?",1
"On the -- from an aggregate point of view, looking at it worldwide, looking at the data on iPhone for the June quarter, there's not obvious evidence in there that there's a macroeconomic headwind. I'm not saying that there's not one. I'm saying that the data doesn't show it where we can clearly see that in the Wearables, Home and Accessories area. And so I would differentiate those 2.",1
"And I think about 90 days ago, you were pretty confident with the new M2 chip that you could continue to grow throughout a potential drawdown in that particular market. Do you still feel that way? And if you can kind of share how you're thinking about the different sort of components of your growth versus the market.",1
"Thank you and good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, and he will be joined by Apple COO, Tim Cook, and Apple Treasurer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&A session with analysts.",1
Congratulations to you and all your team members.,1
"While I'm calling you on my iPhone 13 Max Pro and loving it, I just wanted to ask you, though, with replacement cycles, have you noticed any change now that we've been through like 2.5 years of COVID where people upgrading at a different rate and kind of post COVID, hopefully, upgrade cycles or replacement cycles, how we should kind of think about that? Obviously, when I drop and break my phone, I replace it immediately. But a normal replacement, have they changed at all? Any insights from that would be great.",1
"It's challenging to measure the replacement cycle at any point in time with exact precision, and so I'm going to punt on the question a bit. However, our key task is to make a product that everybody loves and that they want to trade in their current phone to get. And so that's what we are focused on is innovating like crazy and giving somebody something that they really want and see themselves using.",1
"Okay, that makes sense. Well, then maybe I can ask Luca a question more on the gross margins. As you look ahead, the supply chain issues, expedited shipping and all of that, do you think probably the September quarter is kind of the worst of FX and all those headwinds and things? Or is there a little bit of timing delays due to your contractual purchase commitments that you do, that maybe your suppliers are looking at higher costs and you're benefiting from some lower contracts or maybe that has already caught up? If you could give us some insights on the kind of longer-term nature of the directions or the gross margin impacts.",1
"Jim, I would say we provide guidance for the current quarter. But if we look ahead, there's always a couple of elements in gross margin that are a bit outside of our control and we need to be mindful of that. One of them is the foreign exchange environment. That is having an impact already for the September quarter, had an impact on June. And obviously, strong dollar tends to be a headwind for us. As you know, we have a hedging program and so we mitigate that impact. But over time, those hedges roll off and so it becomes more challenging for us. We'll see what happens with foreign exchange rates over time. That is going to be a variable that we need to track.",1
"The other one that has an impact on the aggregate gross margin is our mix of products and services. As you know, they have different margin profiles for very different reasons, different businesses, even different accounting treatment at times. And so that is also something that we will need to track over time. What matters to us, I think it goes back to Tim was saying earlier, is we want to make sure that people love our products and services, and we want all of them to be equally successful in the marketplace.",1
"Certainly, as you've seen over the last year, we've had a significant expansion in gross margins in spite of very difficult economic circumstances from COVID to inflation, interest rates going up and our margins have expanded. From a commodity standpoint, I think you were asking a question around components. Commodities are behaving okay. We're seeing some price pressure on some silicon components. But other than that, we've -- actually commodities are behaving well.",1
"And Tim, I apologize, it's also macro-related. You mentioned that it impacted digital advertising within Services. I'm just kind of curious, if the macro does worsen, do you worry about subscriber growth, App Store purchases, et cetera? And conversely, are there any parts of the Service business that you consider recession-proof, like maybe a buy now, pay later or something else? And then I have a quick follow-up for Luca.",1
"Okay. And for my follow-up, I know you said you don't want to sort of predict the macro here or be an economist. But if I go back and look at the sort of OpEx for the last few years, you've been increasing that by a double-digit percentage. And just given the uncertainty that you've talked about in the macro further on this call a lot, how are you thinking about sort of that investment base going forward? Are you trying to look at areas that where you can sort of pull back? I mean, just in terms of how you're preparing for the uncertainty is I guess the question.",1
"We have incorporated all of our thoughts in the guidance that Luca gave, which says that we think in the aggregate, we're going to accelerate revenues in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter and will decelerate on the Services side. And so we see the digital advertising cloud, if you will, continuing in the current quarter.",1
"Got it, got it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on the lockdown in China during the June quarter. Do you actually see any noticeable negative effects on your App Store revenue for the region or any positive effects like maybe more gaming downloads?",1
"China had very good results on Services last quarter. And so they grew strong double digit better than the company average, and they set a new June quarter revenue record during the quarter.",1
Thank you. A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. The numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. Please enter confirmation code 8820355. These replays will be available by approximately 5 p.m. Pacific Time today.,1
"Good day, and welcome to this Apple Computer fourth quarter financial results conference call. Today's call is being recorded.",1
"At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.",1
"We believe in investing through the downturn. And so we'll continue to hire people and invest in areas, but we are being more deliberate in doing so in recognition of the realities of the environment.",1
"Yes, both things are true. We did see a lower demand based on the COVID lockdowns in the cities the COVID lockdowns affected. And we did see a rebound in those same cities toward the end of the quarter in the June time frame. And in particular, in the run-up to June 18, which as you know, is a major shopping holiday in China. We think that the net of that was still a negative, but some of it did rebound by June time frame. The restrictions begin to come off toward the beginning of June, if my memory is correct.",1
"Yes, I wouldn't want to project into this quarter. But for last quarter, what we saw was the -- when the COVID restrictions hit in the Shanghai corridor, we lost the primary source of supply for Mac units. And that was either running at a reduced rate or down completely for the majority of the quarter. And so it was a very big impact to the Mac business.",1
"We're thrilled right now to have over 14,000 ARKit apps in the App Store. And they're providing incredible AR experiences for millions of people. And that's utilizing iPhone and iPad. And of course, we are in the business of innovation so we're always exploring new and emerging technologies. But I wouldn't want to say anything beyond that.",1
"We felt good, frankly, that we were able to, by the end of the quarter, get this back to where we were down 10 points. But the negative 10 I would classify as being driven by supply. And of course, FX feeds into this as well because of the translation issues around the world. There's also some impact because of the business in Russia. But those are the 3 kind of reasons that I would tell you.",1
"In terms of testing the demand, you can't really test the demand unless you have the supply. And we were so far from that last quarter that we have an estimate of what we believe demand was. But it is an estimate. We recognize how the industry is doing. We think that we've got a great story with the Mac with getting M1 out and now M2 out. We have a very, very strong offering for the back-to-school season and we'll see how we do this quarter. We'll report back in October.",1
"Tim, I was hoping you could share a little bit more about how you're thinking about the supply headwinds. You said less severe or less worse supply challenges into September. I'm interested when you think you find balance across products. And also, any thoughts on how or when that might influence replenishment of supply into your retail channels?",1
"To give you a little more color on what we saw in the June quarter, we came in slightly below, from a constraint point of view, the $4 billion number that we had put, at the 4 to 8 are the low end of that range. And the majority of that constraint last quarter was coming out of the COVID restrictions that occurred, that resulted in plant closures and plants running at less than full utilization for some amount of the quarter, in some cases, the majority of the quarter.",1
"And then the other component that is the minority part of it is the silicon shortage that has affected our results for several quarters now. If you look into the future, the silicon shortage, we're not forecasting when that will end. We think that in the aggregate, our constraint numbers for the September quarter will be less than they were in the June quarter. But of the 2 -- there are these 2 components, and of course, we're optimistic about the COVID restriction piece of this.",1
"Okay. The other item. Tim, any thoughts on how you're thinking strategy is evolving with respect to progress in AR, VR in your existing products? Anything you're learning about content or how you're thinking about that opportunity?",1
"Luca, you mentioned revenues to accelerate year-over-year overall in September versus your June growth rate. Would you say that it would be reasonable to assume normal quarter-on-quarter seasonality of about $7 billion or so? Or would you say there are additional puts and takes this time around that could drive upside and downside to that? I know you noted 600 bps year-over-year on FX as potentially one of those. But maybe help us think through, on a sequential basis, how much of a normal versus abnormal seasonality we should expect? And I have a follow-up.",1
"Great. And congrats on the results in this tough macro. I guess I wanted to start with China smartphone market here a bit. Tim, I thought you said in response to earlier question that you haven't really seen a material impact from the macro on iPhone yet. But wondering, did you see an impact of the COVID lockdowns there on demand itself? Or was there a snapback fall in that? If you can comment about the sort of exit run rate that you saw in that market, following the COVID shutdowns ending there. And I have a follow-up.",1
"Yes, Wamsi, as you know, as we said earlier, we're not providing guidance because of all the uncertainty out there. But we have given a few data points. So one of them, which you've mentioned, approximately 600 basis points of negative foreign exchange. I mean, you do a rough math, it's around $5 billion. That's a big number right there that is going to affect us, that we are having some impact from the situation in Russia and that is obviously different from normal seasonality as well.",1
"Our supply constraints, as Tim just said, are going to be lower than what we've seen in the June quarter but they're still going to be there. So when you look at those 3 headwinds and you combine them with the acceleration that we talked about, we feel that, that is pretty remarkable.",1
"Okay, Luca. And Tim, I wanted to follow up on your comment about the macro impact that you've seen on wearables. Your wearables portfolio is probably at the lowest ASP range across your product portfolio. As you're giving this guidance or directional guidance here, how much of an impact are you assuming in potentially any macro-related slowdowns across the rest of the portfolio? Why would investors not think that it would be prudent to assume some sort of creep-up of some of these -- some of the hesitation maybe that the macro environment is driving, particularly as it pertains to your higher ASP products?",1
"Yes. Let me expand a little bit on Wearables, Home and Accessories so that I clearly communicate what we saw. We saw sort of a cocktail of headwinds on Wearables, Home and Accessories. We saw FX, which we've talked about. We saw supply constraints, which we've talked about. Of course, there was an impact from the business in Russia.",1
"But in addition to those things, which -- those things affected all the products to some degree, we also had a different launch timing for certain home and accessory products. Like in the year-ago quarter, I think, had AirTag in it. That's just 1 example of something that announced last year that didn't announce this -- that we didn't have a comparable announcement this year.",1
"And in -- so in addition to those 4 items, we believe, based on the data, that there was also a macroeconomic environment hit. And whether or not that is because they're lower ASPs versus the higher ASPs of a phone, I can't tell you that. I can just tell you that looking at the numbers, there does appear to be headwinds in addition to the 4 items that we can articulate and we believe those to be macroeconomic headwinds.",1
"As it relates to international iPod results, we continue to be happy with our progress. In the U.K., Canada, Japan, and Australia, our market share ranges from 40 to 50% and in many western European countries, we've picked up market share year-over-year, typically 6 to 7 points in place like France and Germany and Italy and Spain.",1
"We're always looking and we continue to look. But we would only acquire something that were strategic. We acquire a lot of smaller companies today and we'll continue to do that for IP and for great talent. And -- but we don't discount doing something larger either if the opportunity presents itself. And so -- but I don't want to go through my list with you on the phone, but we're always looking.",1
"Just going back to inventory and channel inventories for Macs, do you feel you can get that back to normal levels ahead of the holiday season?",1
"Thank you very much. Three questions on the retail. Peter, could you tell us how many retail store employees you had?",1
"Thanks, Bill. Next question, please.",1
Your next question comes from Steve Lidberg - Pacific Crest Securities.,1
"Good afternoon. Peter, I was hoping you could provide some thoughts with regards to your ability to attract additional major studio content into the feature film category for iTunes. If there is hesitation or hurdles, what are you facing there? Thanks.",1
Last October we announced TV shows with just five programs and within a year have over 220 today from over 40 networks. We've just launched movie downloads with one studio and have 75 titles and we plan to add more over time.,1
"Thanks, Steve. Next question, please.",1
"Your next question comes from Jonathan Hoopes, ThinkEquity Partners.",1
"Yes. We have about 5,800 people in our retail stores.",1
"Then one last question on iTunes, if I could. Could you give any more color on profitability of movies versus music? Any update on that since you're getting further down the road here with videos?",1
"Okay, thank you. Also on retail, did you mention what the CapEx was for the retail segment?",1
"I didn't, but I would be happy to. Our CapEx in the quarter was $134 million and the retail portion of that was $50 million.",1
"Great, thanks. One last one. Did you mention what the manufacturing margin was for retail?",1
I didn't. It was $188 million.,1
"Thank you, Jonathan. We have time for one final question.",1
Our final question will come from Jesse Tortora from Prudential.,1
"Bill, we don't give products' specific gross margins; our philosophy is to run the store a little bit over breakeven.",1
We typically air freight portables and we would continue to do that this quarter. Last quarter we also air freighted iMacs because of their popularity in September and we would continue to do so for a portion of those in the current quarter.,1
I'll make a few comments and Tim can chime in. Certainly the level of sales and the mix within the products would be big levers and direct versus indirect sales would be another lever.,1
"Hi, Peter. I seem to recall last year in the December quarter you had an extra week. I was wondering if you could give us any additional metrics in terms of how that may have affected iPods or Mac units, just to get our arms around forecasting that for this upcoming quarter?",1
"Your next question comes from Shaw Wu, American Technology Research.",1
"Just one quick one on iTV, any initial feedback you can provide us on that product? Second, any comment on what type of units this product could be? Is it a couple hundred thousand units, or a multimillion type of product.",1
We announced that product before shipping it to give customers a total view of the solution that we're bringing to market as we announced the down loading of movies. We are not projecting the sales of it in the future. We will be shipping it in the first calendar quarter of next year.,1
"Thank you, Shaw. Next question, please.",1
Your next question comes from John Jarvis - Boston Company.,1
John Jarvis - Boston Company,1
"Sure. Last year it was a 14-week quarter for us as we realign our calendar every six or seven years. The iPod shipments in the year ago quarter were certainly benefited by that 14th week, which fell between Christmas and New Year's and as we told you last January, we increased our channel inventories in the quarter by about 550,000 units. So you're thinking through iPods, you should account for the 14th week and an increase in inventory and if you're thinking through Mac sales, certainly contemplate a 14th week.",1
"Do you think you'll have to air freight anything in, or do you think the recovery is going to be manageable here, or do you really have to hustle to get stuff in here into the states to catch up?",1
"Your next question comes from Bill Fearnley, FTN Midwest.",1
"Thanks, two questions on the guidance. When you look at the economic environment and the consumer in particular, could you give us a view of what you're seeing there as we approach the holiday season? How does that affect guidance? And I have a follow-up.",1
Gary will take your first question.,1
"Again, this would be generally speaking, it's from a macro point of view, but the economy is slowing because the Fed has hiked 17 times over the last two or three years. But what most of us are hearing from economists out there is that economists think that the economy is headed for a soft landing and the consumer appears resilient in that, especially as energy prices have eased. We intend to agree with this outlook, barring any surprises.",1
"Thanks. When you look at availability for the upcoming quarter, you come into the quarter having channel inventory that's below expectations. Do you expect being below target inventory here for Macintoshes for a good chunk of the fourth quarter, or do you expect to see some recovery in the beginning of the quarter?",1
Channel inventory is a function of both supply and demand. We've factored our thinking on both of those into our guidance that Peter has already laid out.,1
"Thanks for taking my call. Pete, what do you see the key levers that could provide upside or downside for this quarter?",1
"Obviously, commodity costs are another one, although I believe we have a reasonable handle on those. So I think the greatest ones are the top line.",1
"We today have the iTunes music store in 21 countries, which is covering off close to 90% of where music is legally purchased. We look forward to bringing movies international in 2007.",1
"We delivered over 300,000 personal training sessions andended the quarter with 387,000 members in our one-to-one and pro-care programs.Over 31 million people visited our stores during the quarter, representing over12,500 customers per store per week.",1
"We are recognizing revenue from iPhone handset sales usingsubscription accounting over a 24-month estimated economic life. Total revenuerecognized during the quarter from sales of iPhones, iPhone accessories, andpayments from AT&T was $118 million. Total deferred revenue from iPhone andApple TV was $636 million at the end of the September quarter compared to $180million at the end of the June quarter.",1
"As you know, after lowering the price of iPhone to $399 lastmonth, we offered $100 credit to customers who had purchased an iPhone prior tothe price reduction. We are accounting for the credits as they are redeemed bycharging the associated product cost to cost of goods sold. We anticipate mostof these redemptions to occur by the end of the December quarter.",1
"We are on track to begin selling iPhones in Europe onNovember 9th, partnering with O2 in the U.K. and with T-Mobile in Germany. Aswe announced last week, we will begin selling the iPhones in France beginningon November 29th, partnering with Orange.",1
"I would like to now turn to the Apple retail stores, whichposted record quarterly revenue and traffic, driven by very strong interest inMacs, our new iPods, and the iPhone.",1
"Revenue was $1.25 billion, representing 42% year-over-yeargrowth. The stores generated $268 million in segment margin compared to $156million in the year-ago quarter. We opened 12 new stores during the quarter,ending with 197 stores. With an average of 190 stores open during the quarter,average revenue per store was $6.6 million compared to the $5.6 million in the year-agoquarter.",1
"The stores sold 473,000 Macs during the quarter,representing 46% year-over-year growth. Once again, over 50% of the customersbuying Macs in our stores during the quarter were new to Mac.",1
"We will continue to invest in new stores in the U.S. andinternationally, with approximately 40 stores scheduled to open in the comingyear, including previously announced high-profile stores in New York andBoston. We are also pleased to announce plans for our first store in China,which will open in Beijing next summer.",1
"Based on the latest data from NPD, iTunes continues to bethe third largest distributor of music in the United States, having surpassedboth Target and Amazon.",1
"Our U.S. education channel also posted an outstandingquarter, with record revenue and Mac shipments. Our new account initiative inthe K12 market was very successful and our extremely popular back-to-schoolpromotion drove strong Macbook and Macbook Pro sales, contributing to our best,higher ed quarter ever, with 36% year-over-year growth in total Mac sales.",1
"Total company gross margin was 33.6%, which was lowersequentially but higher than expected, due to a number of factors. We benefitedfrom a higher margin product mix, a weakening U.S. dollar, abetter-than-expected commodity environment, and a higher mix of directbusiness.",1
"Operating expenses were $1.03 billion, including $58 millionin stock-based compensation expense. We capitalized $22 million of softwaredevelopment expense related to Leopard during the quarter.",1
"OI&E was $170 million. The tax rate for the quarter wasabout 27%, lower than our anticipated rate of 32%, primarily due to a benefitfrom the settlement of prior year audits. We had very strong cash generationduring the quarter, increasing our cash balance to end with $15.4 billion. Cashflow from operations was $1.7 billion.",1
"Looking ahead to the December quarter, I would like toreview our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking informationthat Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. For the quarter, we aretargeting revenue of about $9.2 billion. We expect the total quarterly costs ofnon-cash, stock-based compensation to be approximately $92 million.",1
"We expect gross margin to be about 31%, reflectingapproximately $12 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We areguiding gross margin down sequentially as a result of several factors,including the full quarter impact of our recent product transitions and reducedpricing, lower sales of iLife and iWork in their second quarter, seasonallyhigher component costs, and a higher mix of indirect sales.",1
"We are thrilled to have sold 1.1 million iPhones during thequarter and customers are really loving the product. Our research shows that anamazing 95% of iPhone customers would recommend the iPhone to others.Additionally, the research firm Strategy Analytics, estimates that iPhone wasthe fourth highest selling handset in the U.S. market in the September quarter.",1
"Based on the latest data from ISPI market research, 17% ofglobal music sales in the first half of calendar 2007 were digital, up from 11%in all of 2006. We believe that the popularity of iTunes has been instrumentalto the growth in this trend.",1
"Great. And lastly, have you seen a pickup in either iMac or iPod following the September price moves?",1
"Please note that some of the information youâll hear duringour call may consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, grossmargin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensationexpense, taxes, and earnings. Actual results or trends could differ materiallyfrom our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the risk factorsdiscussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2006, the Forms 10-Q for the first, second,and third quarters of 2007, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and theattached press release.",1
"The post-launch in iPod, we saw an acceleration of demand and it was that acceleration that allowed us to exceed our expectations for iPod in the quarter. The announcement of the new iMac lineup in early September was extremely well received. We air freighted units to market in order to cut transit times and get them to our customers as quickly as we could. It was partly the iMac that led to a stalling below the four to five week target on the channel inventory.",1
"Thanks, Jesse. A recording of today's call will be available for replay via telephone for seven days beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific time today. The number for the replay is 719-457-0820 and the confirmation code is 4134501. A replay of the audio webcast of this call will be available beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific time today at www.apple.com/investor.",1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896. Financial analysts can contact John Hoover or me with additional questions, John is at 408-974-4570, and I'm at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
Thank you. That will conclude today's conference.,1
"Good day, everyone and welcome to this Apple Incorporatedfourth quarter 2007 quarterly results conference call. Todayâs call is beingrecorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like toturn the conference over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director InvestorRelations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joiningus. Speaking today is Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer, and heâll be joined by AppleCOO Tim Cook and Treasurer Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with analysts.",1
"Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-lookingstatements or information which speak as of their respected dates. With that, Iwould like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.",1
"Other music revenue grew 33% year over year, once againfueled by strong iTunes store sales. We are very pleased with initial reactionto the iTunes WiFi music store and our new relationship with Starbucks. iTunescontinued to account for over 85% of songs purchased and downloaded in the U.S.,according to the latest data available from Nielsen Soundscan, and iTunescustomers have now purchased over 3 billion songs and 100 million TV shows.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are pleasedto report record results, including the highest September quarter revenue andearnings in Apple's history. Revenue of $6.22 billion increased 29% over theprior September quarter. The revenue was driven by record Mac sales andcontinued strong demand for iPods.",1
"Operating margin for the quarter was stronger than expectedat 17.1%, resulting primarily from higher revenue and gross margin than we hadanticipated. Net income was $904 million, which was up 67% over the priorSeptember quarterâs results and translated to earnings per share of $1.01.",1
"I would like to first talk about our Mac products andservices, which represented 62% of our total quarterly revenue. We areextremely pleased to have shipped 2.16 million Macs, 400,000 above the Junequarterâs all-time record for Apple and representing 34% growth over theyear-ago quarter.",1
"On a worldwide basis, Apple's growth rate was over two timesIDCâs most recently published market growth rates for the September quarter.Customers responded very favorably to the new iMacs we announced in August,driving 31% year-over-year growth in desktop systems. Demand for Apple's Macbooksand Macbook Pros continued to be very strong. Sales of portables increased 37%over the prior September quarter and accounted for 62% of Macs sold. We endedthe quarter with slightly less than three weeks of Mac channel inventory.",1
"Now I would like to discuss our music products and services,which accounted for 36% of total revenue during the quarter. We sold 10.2million iPods, representing 17% growth over the year-ago quarter. We began andended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channelinventory.",1
Reaction to the new iPods announced last month has been verypositive and we are shipping the best iPod lineup ever as we head into theholiday buying season. Apple executed a very smooth transition to an all-newiPod lineup without a hitch.,1
"Thank you, Brian. Next question, please.",1
"Okay, great. Are there any updates on any of the iTunes stores launching in international markets? It seems like in a number of countries, like Japan, the iPod sales really preceeded iTunes stores for whatever reason. Any update you can give on iTunes as it progresses in international markets, movie downloads in international markets, et cetera?",1
"We did drop below the four to five weeks, as Peter said in his opening remarks. That was due primarily to very, very strong demand on the MacBook and a great reception to the iMac that we announced in early September, the new lineup of iMac. I do anticipate being able to get the channel back to reasonable levels during the quarter, but I'm not forecasting what will happen at the end of the quarter.",1
That will come from Shannon Cross - Cross Research.,1
"Good afternoon. The 1.5 or 1.6 Mac number is obviously impressive. As you look at that number, is there any way for us to think about what potentially could be pent-up demand in that number versus the pure demand? I guess it's a difficult question, but how do you think about this kind of tradeoff?",1
"Gene, I think the Mac results were a combination of us completing the Intel transition. The exceptional customer response to the innovative products that included those that were transitioned and very, very strong back to school and education sales including two large K-12 deals that totaled 50,000 units during the quarter.",1
"As you look at the December quarter, can you remind us last year, I know that the iMac was pretty successful in the December quarter. Does the baton get shifted for the holiday quarter to the iMac from the notebooks? Is that one way to look at it, or is there any differentiation there?",1
"In the holiday quarter, typically the consumer side of the house does extremely well and consumers are buying both notebooks and desktops.",1
"Lastly on the Shuffle, any idea on when that's going to be shipping?",1
We will ship by the end of October.,1
"Just a couple questions. Can you give us any color on boot camp downloads? What are your surveys saying, people are coming, over 50% in the store are switchers, are they looking running OSX or Windows?",1
"It was a bit above 20 million. The performance in the stores was just outstanding. The revenue was $934 million. We were up year-over-year 41%. Mac sales were up 60%. Our new to Mac for Mac sales actually went over 50% this quarter. And it's amazing, given that we've sold 323,000 Macs in the quarter, that a little more than half of the people had never owned a Mac before. We were thrilled by that.",1
"On boot camp, Shannon, we're over 1 million downloads, which we are very, very pleased with. We continue to have a plan to integrate boot camp in Leopard next spring.",1
"Regarding the performance in the stores, again, this quarter we went over 50% new to Mac and I think customers are coming in looking at Macs based upon just our great hardware, the stability of OSX, the great iLife software and the great experience they're having in the stores.",1
"Can you give any metrics in terms of iTunes stores, games were just launched, videos. What kind of take rates? At one point, I heard a goal of 1 million videos, or movies per week, by the end of the year. Is that still a goal?",1
"We will likely re-release game and movie sales at a future date. I don't want to comment specifically, but we are very happy with the performance of the iTunes store with everything that it's selling, and as I said, we think it's a big reason why people are buying iPods and accessories and certainly think it's helping us in the Mac business.",1
"Okay, Peter, just a clarification on tax rate, you said 32% going forward, but are any of the foreign tax benefits in terms of the mix shift of revenue ongoing, in which case maybe we'll see a lower tax rate?",1
We contemplated that in the guidance that I've given you for the first quarter.,1
That will come from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffrey.,1
"Last question is, you mentioned traffic in the stores greater than 20 million, can you be a bit more specific?",1
That will come from Richard Farmer - Merrill Lynch.,1
"We don't forecast out the portable and desktop area, but as you mentioned, there is a widespread movement to portables, and our portables grew 56% year-over-year. So we're incredibly pleased with what is a blowout quarter.",1
How should we think about any potential stalls in the Mac business ahead of the Leopard launch next year? Has that typically happened in the past?,1
"We have all of our thinking embedded in our guidance, but as Steve announced at the developer's conference, the Leopard will be shipping in the spring of next year.",1
That will come from Robert Semple of Credit Suisse.,1
"Yes, thanks. Guys, can you characterize the demand for the new Nano launch? I guess in the context of last year, Tim, last year you found the demand staggering and you could only get a million units out the door in the final three-four weeks of September. How did the rollout go this year relative to last?",1
"The customer reception was excellent, the analyst reviews have been very, very favorable. If you look at the quarter in the months, iPod demand really accelerated significantly post the launch and it was that acceleration that allowed us to exceed our expectations for the quarter.",1
"Switching gears to the desktop, growth was about 4% year on year, on a unit basis and probably not that surprising given the cannibalization trends we're seeing in the overall market. But as you look at that business going forward, is that a reasonable growth rate you should be looking for or can it improve with new product introductions and things like that?",1
"Thanks, Rob. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"I don't want to comment quite that specifically. I will say that the iPods' gross margin was above 20% in the September quarter, but the gross margin was down a bit from the June quarter as a result of the price reductions that we took in September and our transition.",1
"That will come from Harry Blount, Lehman Brothers.",1
"Hi, guys. Thank you very much. A couple of quick questions. One is, Peter, could you give a little bit of a sense on direct and indirect trends? Specifically, you guys highlighted last quarter the focus on improving the international penetration. I was wondering if you are in fact seeing a significant increase in the indirect percentage of the iPods? Also, if you could make some directional comments on the PC side?",1
"Harry, our direct percent in Q4 of the September quarter was 54% in total, and that was up from 50% in the June quarter and the year-ago quarter was 52%. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, our Americas and Europe and Japan revenues were up reasonably closely and I would say that we're very happy with both the performance of our indirect channel and our growth overseas.",1
"So the change you're seeing, Peter, is that similar then within product categories as well, the iPods versus the PCs?",1
"As you know, the iPod has a much broader distribution. It's a little less than 40,000 points around the world, direct and indirect. And Mac distribution is a little over 7,000 points.",1
Okay. You guys have made significant improvements in the bill of materials on the iPod. Would it be fair to say that the iPods have now achieved similar gross margins as the PC product line?,1
"Thanks, Shannon. Next question, please.",1
"Thank you. I understand you don't want to give specific gross margin numbers by products, but maybe in the same spirit as what you said qualitatively and directionally about the iPod gross margins, are you able to give a similar color on the Mac gross margin in the September quarter, how that changed sequentially?",1
"Sure. We have some work that we're doing with Coke in Europe, specifically in the U.K. and Germany. They are going to put a specific web site out that is linked directly into iTunes and they will be giving away 70 million free songs over the next month or two.",1
A very small increase.,1
Your next question comes from Keith Bachman - Banc of America.,1
"Peter, in the iPod shipments for the quartercan you give us any color on how much will be ship-in or channel fill?",1
"As we indicated, we ended the quarter within our four to six-week range.",1
"Peter, maybe a different way to phrase the question is what is the inventory levels at the end of last quarter?I don't recall in the iPod range. Was there an extra week that may have been put out there in the September quarter?",1
"Keith, we both began and ended the quarter within this target range. On an absolute number of unit basis, we had a small increase that was due to the transition that we made in September in order to get enough new products into the channel.",1
Less than a few hundred thousand units?,1
"Okay, fair enough. Thank you. On the same-store sales, Peter, can you give us any color there on the retail side? I know you added some stores, what was the same-stores sales growth?",1
"Charlie, as you know, we don't comment on specifics, but as we said in August, we'll be shipping Leopard in the spring.",1
"It was up a couple of percent. The Mac sales, as you can see, were up very strong year-over-year. They were up 60% in units. iPod sales in total were up, but impacted on a per-store basis because we've got a much wider distribution capability this year than we did last. And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we've got a little under 40,000 points of sale for the iPod around the world.",1
"I'm not sure I followed that. If you had same-store sales, you're saying it would be marginally positive on year-over-year basis?",1
"No, total iPod sales were up in total, but on a per-store basis, they were down a little bit as a result of the increase in the channel distribution.",1
"Thanks, Keith. Next question, please?",1
Your next question comes from Brian Blair - Wedge Partners.,1
"Hi, thank you. I was wondering if you could comment at all on any iPod or marketing promotions you're doing in the international markets right now that are different from what we're seeing in the U.S.? If there's anything special going on to try to drive demand in some of the international markets?",1
"Thanks, Charlie. Next question, please.",1
"Yes. My second question is, at the developer's conference, Steve said there would be some new, surprising features in Leopard. My first question is, are there new features that haven't been shown yet? Secondly, could virtualization capabilities be one of them?",1
"Yes, I don't want to be that specific. The Mac margins, we are quite happy within the September quarter and that was one of the reasons why our gross margin exceeded the guidance that we gave and part of the product mix that we saw.",1
"Okay. Can you provide, maybe quantify the number of iPods that were shipped in conjunction with the back to school promotion. How much did that help iPod units in the quarter?",1
"Another one, a little off the beaten path, but I just wonder what you think of Googleâs purchase of YouTube? As you think longer term about the evolution of the video distribution market, outside the mainstream content providers, how do you think the landscape is changing and does any of that affect your business? What do you think of that?",1
"Well, I think I'll let the people at Google comment on YouTube, but we continue to believe that video will be big in the portable space, not only in PCs but in iPods and we certainly look forward to participating in that going forward.",1
"Thanks, Richard. Next question, please.",1
"Chris Whitmore from Deutsche, bank.",1
Question on channel inventories for iPod. Can you give any color to the recently released products versus previous generation products?,1
"We don't give the specific breakout, but I see no issue in clearing the remaining inventory on the products we're shipping previous to the launch.",1
The back to school promotion was a key factor in having excellent education results. We don't disclose the exact number.,1
"We've been taking orders, obviously, Charlie, from our online store and our channels and we're very excited to get shipments underway in a couple of weeks to really test it.",1
"Okay. Lastly on the MacPro uptake. Any color on customer reception for that upgrade and to what extent is demand still pent up as we're waiting for key applications, like Creative Suite to become universal before we see better shipments for that product?",1
"Both customer and analyst reaction has been very, very positive on the Mac Pro announcement that we made in August. We are still seeing what we believe is a delay in purchasing that we think primarily is associated with applications, in particular, the Creative Suite.",1
Thanks a bunch.,1
"Thanks, Chris. Next question, please.",1
Your next question comes from Charles Wolf with Needham.,1
"Hi, guys, I've got a couple of questions. Do you have any preliminary indication of demand for the Shuffle? I've been hearing it could be huge.",1
"Bill, let me take the three product areas and briefly comment on your question. In the iPod space at the end of the quarter, we were still filling the channel to get the new product at the right level in the channel. Weâve now completed that but were not at the end of last quarter.",1
"And the iPhone, as Iâve alluded to before, we felt we ended with the right level of channel inventory and itâs difficult to predict demand for the quarter but today I know of no issues in providing the right level of supply.",1
"On the Mac side, we have significant backlogs on the new product and we are working very, very hard around the clock to fill those just as fast as we can and weâll see what the trajectory of demand is but Iâm confident that we can produce a lot. Whether itâs enough, I donât know because itâs hard to forecast the demand.",1
"Well, if the fog lifts on October and your demand visibility gets better at the beginning of November, do you still have time to ramp your builds to affect the first quarter number then, from a supply chain perspective?",1
"We had an outstanding quarter last quarter with setting a record with doing over 11 million, and at the same time we were setting a Mac record, which is I think very phenomenal in and of itself. But we've seen several competitors come to market to try to compete with the iPad over time. They've had -- some had different form factors, different price points. And I think it's reasonable to say that none of these have gained any traction thus far. And in fact, as all of those competitors were coming to market, our share actually went up such that in the June quarter IDC -- according to IDC, we were responsible for 3 out of every 4 tablets sold. And I think when you really assess this thing and look at iOS 5, iCloud, the ecosystem with iTunes and the App Store and books and movies and the fact that we have over 140,000 native apps for iPad versus a number in the hundreds for the other guys, I feel very, very confident about our ability to compete and extremely confident in our product pipeline.",1
"And Peter, did I hear that right that you mentioned the deferral of iPhone for new carriers and new country additions? Wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on what that was and the potential impact on the numbers?",1
"Gene, that's in my prepared remarks. We opted to defer adding new carriers or countries during the September quarter knowing that we would launch the iPhone 4S very early in the October month, and we wanted to launch our new carriers with our latest products so we waited. I think that did have some impact on the September quarter. I think the biggest impact were the rumors that were just very pervasive, particularly in the second half of the quarter. There just seemed to be the rumor of the day. But that's behind us. We have just started selling the iPhone 4S and it's off to a fantastic start, and we're thrilled to be including Sprint and KDDI in our carrier lineup. And we're heading into this holiday season with the best product lineup Apple has ever shipped and tremendous momentum.",1
"And Tim, I realized the Amazon Fire question is out of the way here, but do you have any just high-level thoughts on the size of the tablet market? I mean, it's not netbooks. It's computers. I mean, how do you think about, internally thinking about, how big this market could be in the next 2 years?",1
"We thought, Gene, from the beginning of this that it would be a huge market, and it has been even greater than we thought. And we've now sold 40 million on a cumulative basis. And it's pretty clear to me that if you forecast out in time that the tablet market -- I still believe it will be larger than the PC market. That's not a guidance number. That's just something that I very much believe. There will be many, many more people that can access it, and the ease of use is so phenomenal and off the charts that I think it's a huge opportunity for Apple across time.",1
"From Barclays Capital, we will hear from Ben Reitzes.",1
"I was actually wondering if we could talk a little bit more about the iPhone. Just do you have any idea of what -- how many units do you feel were pushed out and deferred into the next quarter? And in general, what do you think -- how should we be thinking about the 4S launch given the pent-up demand from the quarter? And anything else with regard to the velocity and how it worked into your guidance of $37 billion?",1
"Ben, I think the number -- you can't run the experiment twice. So we can't tell you with precision how many units we would have sold if there had not been rumors and people weren't expecting a new iPhone. But I certainly believe it was a substantial, and that's the reason that we called it out. And I think anybody monitoring the press would probably come to the same conclusion. You could go out and talk to a group of customers and probably get the same kind of answer. On the 4S, I think it's off the charts. If you do a comparison of the 3 days after launch of last year on iPhone 4, we came in at 1.7 million. This year, we were over 4 million in the same time frame, and so that's the mother of all uplifts. And so we're thrilled with how we've gotten started, and the feedback that we're getting from customers is just fantastic. And so I couldn't be more pleased with where we are.",1
"And just my follow-up is with regard to the iPad category, now that it's, I wouldn't call it maturing, but a few more quarters of experience, do you -- generally in Macs, you're up a little sequentially lately in the fourth quarter. You have an extra week now. Any thoughts on how the iPad seasonality may be working in the iPad over the next quarter or 2, just in terms of more experience or gut feel for how that product progresses?",1
"Ben, it's Peter. I'll give you some thoughts on the December quarter but we're not going to provide our thoughts yet for the March quarter. We would expect to establish new company records for both the iPhone and the iPad in the December quarter. These are fantastic products, and the momentum here is tremendous. And for Macs, we would expect to outgrow the market on a year-over-year basis and report to you our 23rd consecutive quarter of outgrowing the market.",1
Shannon Cross with Cross Research Financial.,1
"My first question. Tim, can you talk a little bit more on how you see Siri and how you see Siri in the future? I mean, is this a feature or do you see it more as a key way that consumers are going to interact with their devices? Just any color you could give would be great.",1
"The number of people using it already is amazing, and the questions and so forth and the personality that it has is also incredible. And so we see this as a profound innovation. And I think over time, many, many people will use it in a substantial way. And what percentage of their input will be by that, I don't know. And what percentage of their searches, I don't know. But our guts have been since the beginning of this is that it is substantial and it's an incredible innovation, and that's the feedback that we're getting from customers.",1
Okay. Great. And then can you make a comment just on the supply chain given the HDD issues in Thailand? What are your thoughts -- any clarity you've gotten from the people on the ground there?,1
"It's a very good question. Our hearts go out to all the people in Thailand who have experienced these devastating losses of life and property as a result of the monsoons and the flooding. Like many others, we source many components from Thailand and have multiple factories that supply these components. There are several factories that are currently not operable, and the recovery timeline for these factories is not known at this point. As you can appreciate, the weather really hasn't allowed an ability to assess those. From the work that we have done, we would say that our primary exposure is on the Mac because as you point out, of the number of drives or drive components that are sourced in or -- Thailand is a significant portion of the total of worldwide supply of drives. And so I can't give you a precise accounting. It is something that I'm concerned about. We do expect -- I'm virtually certain there will be an overall industry shortage of disk drives as a result of the disaster. How it affects Apple? I'm not sure, but we placed our assessment to the degree that we can make one in the guidance that Peter has already given you in the $37 billion number.",1
"And then the second question is around the iPad. Recently, Amazon with the Kindle Fire is trying to make the tablet market more of a soapbox derby in terms of lower price points but maybe limited feature sets. Can you kind of weigh in on what your view is? Is this making more of a hybrid market where it's not really a tablet but kind of a hybrid and Apple has not really seen any effects from a demand perspective at this point?",1
"Yes. Mark, I think we have an outstanding team in this area and a track record that's unparalleled in the industry. Although we keep trying to improve it all the time, we've also used our balance sheet in a favorable way here to do some strategic deals on different parts that we felt were very, very important to Apple across a series of products. As we get larger, there are some areas where we've elected to diversify some. However, our approach has been and I think will always be to do business with as few people as we can so we can be very deep with them and do great innovative stuff together, and you can't tend to do that when you go out to many, many different people. And I think they give us great quality and also reasonable prices, and so that winds up helping our margin.",1
"Two questions. First for Tim. If you weigh in a little more on Apple's historic strength in terms of manufacturing and supply chain strategies, I know we talked about this before, Tim. But can you give us an update in terms of your margin flexibility as you start to use more than one source for certain parts of your supply chain manufacturing chain? And I have a question for Peter after that.",1
"I have a few iPhone questions if I could. Given that the 4S was launched so close to the holiday selling season, can you give us an idea of your confidence in the production ramp and the distribution ramp and how you've mitigated the risk of a shortage during peak consumer demand?",1
"Turning to cash. Our cash and short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $81.6 billion at the end of the September quarter, compared to $76.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, a sequential increase of $5.4 billion. This increase was net of cash paid for the acquisition of Nortel patents and the Nokia settlement during the September quarter. Cash flow from operations was $10.4 billion, an increase of 84% year-over-year.",1
"As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. I'd also like to remind you that approximately once every 6 years, we add a week to the December quarter to align our fiscal periods with the December calendar. So this December quarter will span 14 weeks rather than 13 and will end on December 31.",1
"We expect revenues to be about $37 billion compared to $26.7 billion in the December quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 40%, reflecting approximately $60 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.25 billion, including about $350 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $85 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 24.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $9.30.",1
"In closing, we're extremely pleased with the strong conclusion to our record-breaking fiscal 2011. Over the course of the year, we generated revenue of over $108 billion, an increase of $43 billion or 66% over our fiscal 2010 results. We blew past historical records by selling over 72 million iPhones, 32 million iPads and almost 17 million Macs in fiscal 2011.",1
"We expanded our reach by opening 40 new retail stores, adding scores of new carrier and leaseholder relationships and broadened our online presence through Apple stores and App Stores around the world. And last but not the least, we generated almost $26 billion in net income during the year, an increase of 85% year-over-year, which was even faster than our revenue growth. We're thrilled to begin selling iPhone 4S and to bring iOS 5 and iCloud to our customers this month, and we remain very enthusiastic about our new product pipeline.",1
"From Goldman Sachs, we'll go to Bill Shope.",1
"Bill, it's Tim. We've gotten off to a great start with the 4S. We've sold over 4 million in just 3 days after launch, and so we're thrilled with the start that we have. We're confident that we will have a large supply, but I don't want to predict when supply and demand might balance because the demand is obviously extremely high right now. But I'm confident that we will set an all-time record for iPhone this quarter.",1
"Yes, thanks for the question. Should the China progress has been amazing, if you look at our Greater China revenue, it represented just 2% of Apple in our fiscal year '09. And in the fiscal year we just ended, it accounted for 12%, and if you just look at the quarter that we just ended, it accounted for 16%. So it's our fastest growing major region by far. It delivered $4.5 billion of our revenue for the current quarter, and that's up almost 4x or about 270% year-over-year. That brought the total revenue for the fiscal year to over $13 billion. And to further put that in context, a year ago in fiscal year '10, we were just right above $3 billion. So it is growing at a feverish pace. We have placed new retail stores there as you know. We now have 6 in Greater China. Our online store opened at the end of last year, and so we have still -- we haven't hit our one-year anniversary there yet. We have over 200 Mono-branded stores that we call APRs, which are resellers on there. That's a very premium shopping experience, and we are now up to over 7,000 point of sales on the iPhone in Greater China. And so we're continuing to make investments in this. How far can it go? Certainly in my lifetime, I've never seen a country with as many people rising into the middle class that aspire to buy products that Apple makes. And so I think it's an area of enormous opportunity, and it has quickly become #2 on our list of top revenue countries very, very quickly and we're obviously placing additional investment. We're building more stores there as well as doing quite a few other things to continue to deliver our great products to the people of China. We're also placing additional focus on some other areas that have shown great promise over this fiscal year such as Brazil. Brazil was up 118% year-over-year and went over the $900 million mark. Russia is also beginning to look more and more promising. As I've mentioned on the last call, the Middle East we believe has significant opportunities. So there's several of these markets that historically Apple has not been strong and that the iPhone has really opened up and introduced Apple to a whole set of customers that didn't get excited about looking at other products that we have. And I think certainly, the iPad will be doing the same. And so I think China, the sky is the limit there, and I wouldn't discount some of these other places that I've mentioned as well.",1
Now and just a question on the September quarter iPhone dynamic. So it sounds like the primary negative impact on shipments was purely from a sell-through pause. You didn't have any real channel inventory drawdown issues affect shipments. Is that correct?,1
"Not entirely. If you look at on the sell-through basis, the sequential comparison is down 2.4 million units. That's 19.7 million from the previous quarter, which had an inventory build in it to bring it to a sell-in of over 20 million and to 17.3 million this quarter, which had an inventory reduction of a little less than 200,000, which Peter talked about in his opening remarks. That 2.4 million was much less of a reduction than what we were expecting and was a large factor in our revenue exceeding our guidance by over $3 billion. We expected it to be greater than 2.4 million because we knew that there was great anticipation of the June or July new iPhone because that was the pace that we have been on for the last several years. And as we had predicted, that sell-through decline did occur in the quarter, but not nearly to the extent that we fought and therefore, we significantly beat our guidance. The reduction happened largely in the back half of the quarter as the speculation hit extreme highs. However, we're thrilled to be shipping the new iPhone 4S and iOS 5 and iCloud, and we're very confident that we will set an all-time record in the December quarter for iPhone sales. We -- in our wildest dreams, we couldn't have gotten off to a start as great as we have on the 4S.",1
"From Morgan Stanley, we'll hear from Katy Huberty.",1
"Peter, this quarter you were able to print north of a 40% gross margin despite the mix shift away from your high-margin product and towards lower margin products. So just curious why you don't think you can do better than 40% in December given how well the iPhone 4S is already doing and the favorable component cost environment, and then I have a follow-up for Tim.",1
"Sure. I understand your question, Katy. We expect the gross margin to be relatively flat on a sequential basis. And we expect this because as you pointed out, we do think a favorable component cost environment will continue, and we certainly expect a very strong mix of iPhones, both of which are positive for gross margins. However, we expect both of these to be basically fully offset by the impact of higher cost structures and reduced price points for the recently introduced iPhones and iPods as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. It's really strengthened in the last couple of weeks from where we were across the summer. So that's why.",1
"Okay. And then Tim, over the course of the last year, you've provided great insight into Apple's traction in China. So I wonder if you could update us on how you're tracking in that region, but also provide some insight into how substantial China could be to Apple over time. For instance, is there any reason that China couldn't be as big as the U.S. market once you open more stores and optimize the product set there?",1
"Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your ongoing patent disputes most notably versus Samsung and other Android OEMs? Specifically, I'm wondering if you can characterize what your ultimate objectives are from litigation. Is it to get injunctions on violating products? Is it to capture royalty fees? Or what is it?",1
"Toni, I don't want to comment on any particular litigation. It's our policy not to do that. But basically as you know, we spend a lot of time and money and resource in coming up with incredible innovations, and we don't like it when someone else takes those. And so that's why we -- unfortunately, we've been pushed into the court system as a remedy to that, but I don't want to comment about any particular lawsuit.",1
"Just, I mean, generally speaking, you said as a remedy. What kinds of remedies do you see coming from the court system?",1
I'm sorry?,1
"Okay. And then the original goal for the iPhone, at the time it was obviously classed as audacious, with 1% of the market in the first fiscal year after launch. And you achieved 5x that, Tim. In the recent presentation when you highlighted that, there's 95% of the market to go. I'm wondering if in your minds you have established a similarly audacious goal for the next couple of years for market penetration.",1
"Not one that I published, but we want the iPhone to be in as many customers' hands as possible because we think it's the greatest phone by far. And that's why we live to do that. And so yes, we aspire to much larger volumes than where we are. And we think the smartphone market will eventually absorb the handset market. As I made a point in that presentation, the handset market is this huge market. It's 1.5 billion handsets. And the smartphone market, depending upon which service you believe, is a bit over 400 million or so. And so there's a huge growth in the smartphone market, and then we think that we can also grow within the sector at all. But the big win is to eat into the 1.5 billion and not just for us but I think for others as well, and we are very focused on doing that. You can tell that with the moves that we've made recently.",1
We'll go to Keith Bachman with the Bank of MontrÃ©al.,1
"I have 2. Peter, first for you. Is the extra week for the quarter truly linear on both the revenues and the expenses? And included, the reason I'm asking is just trying to set up, if you will, for the March quarter, the potential impact of that extra week on the March quarter.",1
"Sure, Keith. The 14th week will conclude on New Year's Eve day, which has traditionally been a good sell-through week for us but not typically as strong as the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas day. We'll provide further details on our January call about what we actually saw. That's some indication in terms of what we would see for sell-through. For our expenses, we certainly will have variable expenses and payroll expenses for that 14th week. But some of our fixed cost such as leases and rents and such are fixed, so there will be a benefit there as well.",1
"Okay. And my follow-up is on Japan. In terms of the year-over-year and sequential changes, there was a bigger disparity on units versus revenues, CPU units versus total revenues in Japan. I was just wondering if you could speak to that if you could.",1
"In terms of the revenue performance in Japan, it looked to be a bigger disparity between the units and the revenues than was true in the other regions. I was just wondering why the bigger disparity in Japan. Was it FX, or was it other reasons?",1
"Sorry, Tim. I didn't mean to convey that you were doing that. I meant to say that would that be holding you back philosophically from buying back shares?",1
"A huge percentage of Japan's total revenue in the year-ago quarter was from the iPhone 4 launch. It was iPhone 4's first quarter as you know. And so when you do a year-over-year compare, that adversely affects the revenue compare. The Mac, however, had an incredible quarter growing at 48% in a market that is barely growing at all. And so we gained significant share on the Mac side of the business. The iPhone was a negative year-over-year compare, but we have gotten off to an unbelievable start in Japan. It was one of the first 7 countries, and it's very clear that Japan is yet another example of the delay that we were speaking about earlier.",1
Okay. So the sequential was then there was perhaps a larger delay in Japan for the iPhone 4S than other regions. Is that the way to think about it?,1
Think about it that iPhone is a bigger portion of the revenue [indiscernible].,1
"Tim, I wanted to ask about the medium to longer term iPad opportunity as you see it from an ASP standpoint or segmentation standpoint. And by that, I mean, do you see more opportunity to move that product downmarket to drive elasticity, or upmarket to take on more of the -- or greater percentage on the PC market?",1
"I don't want to get into what we might do, which that answer might do. But let me just go back to -- we see the tablet market as a huge market, and we could not be happier with our position in it. And we've got some fantastic things in the pipeline. And after selling 40 million in the first 18 months, which is more than our wildest dreams were and selling 3 out of every 4, I think we've got a fairly good handle on what to do next.",1
Okay. Perhaps I can ask an initial feedback or expectations around the lower price points of the iPhone business into emerging markets. Can you comment at all or give some color on carrier receptivity of that pricing change and any acceleration in carrier engagements on the back of that?,1
"No, I view those to be totally separate and distinct things. So no, I don't believe it sends that -- it certainly doesn't send that signal from my point of view. The cash is always a topic, and we'll always conclude to do what we think is in Apple's best interest. And I think we've done that so far, and if you look at where we've spent it, I think it's -- I think you would agree.",1
"Mike, I think anyone looking at us and the track record that we've got would not come to any conclusion that we're waving a white flag on innovation. We've had a series of unbelievable products that we believe the best products in the world and our customers tell us that, which is more importantly than us saying it, and we've got a pipeline that's unbelievable.",1
That's one of the things I particularly don't want to comment on.,1
"Rich, it's Peter. Let me make some comments about the December quarter, and then I'll give you more of our philosophy beyond. We're not providing future quarter or future year guidance. For the December quarter, we anticipate our gross margin being about 40% and having nice leverage on OpEx yielding an operating margin of just over 31%, which would be quite strong. As we look forward, we are going to continue to offer the very best products to customers that we can. We are going to be extremely innovative. We're very confident and excited about what's in the product pipeline. You'll see us be aggressive in the future. And where customers want to buy, that's fine with us. We just want them to buy our products. As I look back over the last couple of years, I think we've done a very good job gaining market share and growing our top and bottom lines and running a great business, and we're just going to keep coming to work every day to do that in the future.",1
Okay. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the price reductions on the 3GS offering. You've gone to free on postpaid and dramatically reduced the price $160 to $200 in most countries on the prepaid offering. Do you -- how are you thinking about this price reduction in terms of its potential elasticity? Do you see it as targeting a new segment of consumers? And how are you thinking about whether this will largely resonate with prepaid customers or with postpaid customers?,1
"We did it because we wanted to make the iPhone more accessible to a broader market. And so not only did we take the 3GS to free on a postpaid basis and that's the U.S., but it's free on postpaid in many, many other markets as well. But we also lowered the price of the iPhone 4 to $99. And so we've done both of those because as we looked at it, these are still fantastic products, and we think that we can do reasonably well selling those in the postpaid markets. It also has the advantage of having a lower price in the prepaid markets. Obviously not free and $99, but lower than where those entry points were previously. And so we did it for both markets, Toni, both the postpay and the prepay markets. Both of those are very, very important to us, and it has been our thinking for a while to do that.",1
"From Citi, we'll hear from Richard Gardner.",1
"Tim, as a follow-up to Shannon's question, I was hoping that you might be willing to give us a more general view of how you view component supply demand and pricing going into the fourth quarter. And then also, particularly unibody casings given the issues that you've had with one of your suppliers in that area as well, do you expect that to have any significant impact on MacBook Pro or MacBook Air supply in the fourth quarter?",1
"On the second question first, we treat every concern that we hear about our suppliers very, very seriously, and we're currently investigating and assessing the situation. And we factored our supply outlook as we currently see it into the numbers that Peter has given earlier. In terms of the general market for components, NAND and DRAM, which really declined last quarter and LCDs, we see all 3 of these generally in a very positive supply situation and therefore, we expect the pricing to continue at favorable levels. Most of the other components we expect to fall at or above historical trends. And so generally speaking, it's a very positive market from a supply point of view. Now that is with the asterisk of the disaster that just happened in Thailand aside, and I'm not sure how that will play out. But I do believe that the risk there is more focused on the Mac portion of our product line.",1
"Okay. And if I could ask a follow-up, I guess, for Peter and Tim. I know you don't give operating margin guidance or gross margin guidance. But it does seem like we could be moving it to a new phase for the company where potentially, several of the fastest growing products in the product line, whether it be iPad or these lower priced iPhones that could see some good price elasticity at the low end, could be the fastest growing products for the company next year and could start to put some pressure on gross margins. I'm just wondering if you, a, agree with that assertion. And b, if that is the case, is it still reasonable to think that the company can maintain or expand operating margins next year if gross margins come under pressure due to product mix?",1
We'll go to,1
"Tim, just following up on your last question, maybe I'll just ask this just absolutely directly. Is buying back shares with your cash, which seems to be sort of the thing that everybody wants you to do, at least certain investors want you to do it, is that perhaps kind of a philosophical white flag that you're not able to create value through product innovation?",1
"I've got just one clarification, one question. On the iPad side, could you just speak about where we are on the distribution rollout of that product, in particular, where we are on countries and carriers and point of sales? And was there any pause around that in the September quarter? And then a question for Tim. Tim, you mentioned just the growth not only in China but also the potential that may exist in Brazil and Middle East and Russia, and I guess you could throw India in there as well. What do you practically need to do to actually realize the potential there? Is that a case of local manufacturing in some of those countries? Is it a case of carrier distribution? And how long might it take to realize that? Because I understand the focus now is on China, but I'm trying to understand what Apple needs to do to realize the potential of the emerging middle class in those countries as well.",1
"Yes, we are in 90 countries on iPad. We have about 40,000 points of sale around the world. To put that in some context, we have about 50,000 on iPod and about 120,000 on iPhone. So you can get a feel for the extent of the rollout there. There are still countries left to do, but we are in the main countries with iPad. Do I think there was a slowdown on iPad? Where the iPhone numbers, it's crystal clear in looking at the numbers that there was a slowdown. That is not the case on iPad. And so where I believe we are from a supply-demand point of view on iPad is that we, somewhere during the quarter, entered a supply-demand balance and stayed there for the balance of the quarter. If you recall on the last call, I said that we were coming in balance in a few countries. And then sometime thereafter, I think that we went into a supply-demand balance around the world. And you can look at the share numbers that third parties have reported, and we're doing extremely well there. We feel -- we couldn't feel better honestly. And the extent of the usage, the comScore group said that 97% of the web usage of tablets in the U.S. is from the iPad, so it's just mind-boggling. So we feel very, very good about that. In terms of the other countries outside of China, we have already started placing efforts in the places that I mentioned. It's not something that we are going to start next week or so. It's something we've already done or I wouldn't have brought it up, frankly. Obviously, we wouldn't have done over $900 million in Brazil with no effort. There are some countries in the world that have protectionalist type of structures where the prices of the goods are extremely high if there's not local content involved. And so we'll assess each of those and decide what's in our best interest. But today, I don't have anything to report there. The basic approach in all of the countries are the same as the game plan that we used in China, and it's just a matter of the course, the rate and pace of the rollout and whether to involve every one of the things that we did in China. In China, we picked everything that we knew to do. We are building retail. We went in with an online store. We're building an APR channel. We're building a third-party channel. We're doing significant advertising. We're really doing everything basically that we're doing in the United States, we're doing in China. We would not be doing that in each of the other countries I named, but we would be doing portions of that and have already started to achieve the numbers that we did last year.",1
"Tim, I was wondering first call as CEO, any thoughts on, any different strategy as far as cash allocation goes? And by that, I mean, dividend and a possible share buyback and maybe talk about these supplier investments also. And then the second question is, you mentioned the tablet market potentially being even bigger than the PC market at some point. Can you discuss the cannibalization levels that you think you're seeing right now versus the PC market?",1
"Let me start with the second question first. I do believe that we're seeing cannibalization. I think that it's showing up in 2 ways. I think that some people are electing to buy an iPad rather than a Mac. However, I believe a materially larger number of people are electing to buy an iPad instead of a Windows-based PC. And so I think we are overwhelmingly coming out very, very well in that cannibalization question. And I would point out that despite that, the Mac had its best quarter by far ever last quarter. And so even with having the best quarter on iPad with some cannibalizations in Mac, the Mac has its best quarter ever, which is almost unbelievable. And so with cannibalization like this, I hope it continues. On your cash question, to date as you know, we've wanted to maintain flexibility. I think everyone that knows us knows that the cash isn't burning a hole in our pocket and we're not the type of people to do silly things with it. We invest it conservatively. If you look at Gary and his team's track record, they've done a phenomenal job in a extremely difficult market for the last few years. We've also taken money and done things with it that are in Apple's best interest. For example, we've acquired several companies. We've acquired some IP as you know. We've invested in the supply chain, and we used money to build out our stores and provide for a lot of new product tooling and the like. And so I believe what we're doing with cash, the way we're -- this cash that we do spend we're doing an extremely good job of it and we're very frugal about using it and using it in the right places. That said, I'm not religious about holding cash or not holding it. I'm religious about a lot of things but not that one. And so we will continually ask ourselves what's in Apple's best interest and always do what we believe is in Apple's best interest. And so it's a topic for the board on an ongoing basis, and we'll continue to discuss it.",1
"Scott, I'd like to add to Tim's answer, just to remind everybody that of the little over $81 billion of cash that we ended in the September quarter with, a bit more than $54 billion or 2/3 of that was offshore.",1
"From RBC Capital Markets, we'll hear from Mike Abramsky.",1
"Total company gross margin was 40.3%, which was 230 basis points higher than our guidance. This difference was almost entirely due to lower component and other product costs. Operating expenses were $2.67 billion and included $253 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $81 million. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%.",1
"Retail segment margin was $679 million compared to $917 million in the year-ago quarter. Store traffic continues to be very strong. We hosted a record 77.5 million visitors in the September quarter. As we look ahead to fiscal 2012, we will continue to focus on international expansion. In total, we expect to open about 40 stores with approximately 3/4 of them outside United States. We will also be expanding or replacing higher volume stores primarily in the U.S. that are simply too constrained to deliver our desired customer experience.",1
"We opened 30 new stores in the quarter, 21 of which were outside United States. On the last weekend of the quarter, we opened 7 stores in 6 countries, including our first store in Hong Kong. With our highest opening day for Mac sales ever, our Hong Kong store joins our 5 other China stores as the highest traffic and among our highest revenue stores in the world. We ended the quarter with a total of 357 stores. With an average of 336 stores opened, average revenue per store was $10.7 million compared to $11.8 million in the year-ago quarter.",1
And our next question will come from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.,1
"The Mac is also increasingly getting pulled into an enterprise where the employees are able to select. And of course, this is a trend that we like to see, and that we think will continue in larger ways. But when people are given the choice, they would prefer a Mac, so Macs are being pulled in as well.",1
"We don't have as much distribution effort on that, but as we see if it gets any larger, we will move accordingly. The great thing is that we're maintaining our focus on the consumer, and the consumer is a forefront on thinking of all our products. And it's these consumers in the enterprise so to speak that are pulling these products in.",1
And so we're not developing two different lines like many companies do and have enterprise versions and consumer versions. This is another part of our simplistic approach to things that I think will pay us great dividend and is already starting to do so.,1
"And I had a follow-up for Peter, I am getting substantial questions, as I am sure everybody on the call is, just about gross margin. So one of the questions I have is, as you're seeing the increase in volume, is there any kind of a change in terms of sort of the scale leverage you have from a manufacturing standpoint? I know you guided to lower gross margins, but the Street of course was higher?",1
"So, just anything you can give us in terms of color on the gross margins with the iPhone 4 in terms of how that's panning out and how we should think about start up costs that were associated with, both that as well as the iPad, just any color would be great?",1
"We don't provide product specific gross margins but we are always working aggressively to lower our costs whether it's the iPhone or any of our other products. I think we have a very good track record in this regard. And we were happy with our gross margins in the September quarter, they were ahead of what we thought. And we see them being just down slightly in the December quarter as we ship more iPods where we've been quite aggressive and continue to ship more iPads as well.",1
I am interested in understanding demand from new carriers to take up iPhone 4 and whether or not you're seeing any pressure on subsidies as you look to expand your distribution networks on the phone business?,1
"We're also enabling in training our carrier partners to do the same. You probably saw a announcement last week with AT&T, and that's a direct result of customers wanting to buy the iPad on a postpaid type plan. And so we're putting a lot of energy in those. iPhone has followed a trajectory that gets into same kinds of numbers as I pointed on iPad where, or a little bit higher by now, is 85% of the Fortune 100 are deploying are deploying or piloting iPhone.",1
"Chris, the pressure that I am getting is on supply. Virtually everyone we're doing business with wants more supply. So that's the pressure that I feel.",1
"Can you give us some color, sorry if I missed this, I jumped on late, but some color in terms of where you are from a number of carriers with iPhone 4, how did you end the quarter? Do you have targets for the December quarter in terms of carrier penetration with existing relationships?",1
"We have, if you count at the country level, we have about 166 relationships that we ended the quarter with in about 89 countries. And so that's a significant expansion across from last year as we in many countries went from a single carrier relationship to more than one carrier.",1
The latest country that we have done that in or that we've announced that in is Germany and we will be launching both with Vodafone and O2 together with our existing partner T-Mobile in Germany later this month.,1
"And all 166 of the carriers have the phone 4 by year end, is that the target?",1
"With iPhone 4, we're in 85 of those 89 countries. And I believe that we will be in all 89 by the end of the year.",1
"And so this isn't a hobby or something we're doing lightly. We put enormous energy in the company, in engineering, in software to build a number of enterprise features in the OS. You've seen that, it gets better and better as we step through the different OS releases. And we're building the sales capability for those groups as well. It's clear that both the phone and the iPad have an enormous opportunity.",1
"On the iPad, there have been some comments about this earlier, but just to give you some stats here, about two-thirds of the Fortune 100 are deploying or piloting iPad. And I don't know about you, but I've never seen an adoption like this in my life in enterprise. Enterprise is historically much slower moving on adoption. We're also seeing the iPad begin to pick up interest in K12 which is another market that historically adopts very, very slowly. And so the early data points look great. And as a matter of fact, we have built and are building additional capacity internally in the sales organizations, to call on businesses and obviously we have a huge amount of sales people already there calling on education institutions.",1
"We don't give specific information out on the margins. But I think you can look at our ASPs and see that they've generally stayed above $600, and that's despite opening up several markets from an exclusive market to a non-exclusive market.",1
"Tim, maybe you want to comment, if I could push you on that Steve. So if the market starts to move towards somewhat lower functionality smartphones in that migration of non-smartphones to smartphones that you talked about. If the market starts to move to dramatically lower price points, you feel you can't make an appropriate product that is good at those price points, you will cede share under those circumstances. Do I hear you correctly?",1
"Is your aspiration for iPhone and iPad to be volume players and market leaders? Or is it simply to make good products? And if you have smaller share like you do in Mac, that's fine. Can you help me with that, please?",1
"Sure, and I'll let Tim say what he's going to say too. First of all, Nokia makes $50 handsets, and we don't know how to make a great smartphone for $50. We're not smart enough to figure that one out yet, but believe me I'll let you know, when we do. So our goal is to make a really breakthrough great product. Make the best products in every industry that we compete in and to drive the cost down, while constantly making the products better at the same time. That's what we did with iPod.",1
"We updated our products many times every year, with better functionality oftentimes at the same price, and sometimes at a lower price. And it was this relentless improvement, and in some cases a lower price that was able to beat our competition and yield the market share that it did. And as you know, we have a very low market share in the phone market in the single digits, in terms of all the handsets. And we have a very high market share now in tablets, because we're the first mover.",1
"But we don't think about it that way. The reason we wouldn't make a seven inch tablet isn't because we don't want to hit a price point, it's because we don't think you can make a great tablet with a seven inch screen. We think it's too small to express the software that people want to put on these things. And we think as a software driven company, we think about the software strategies first.",1
"And we know that software developers they're not going to deal real well with all these different size products, when they have to redo their software, every time a screen size changes. And they're not going to deal well with products where they can't put enough elements on the screen to build the kind of apps they want to build.",1
"So when we make decisions on seven inch tablets, it's not about cost, it's about the value of the product when you factor in the software. You see what I'm getting at? So we're all about making the best products at aggressive prices. And that's what we will do and that's what we've done with the iPod, and that's what we will do with the iPad as well.",1
"You're looking at it wrong. You're looking at it as a hardware person in a fragmented world. You're looking at it as a hardware manufacturer that doesn't really know much about software, who doesn't think about an integrated product, but assumes the software will somehow take care of itself. And you're sitting around saying, ""Well, how can we make this cheaper? Well, we can put on a smaller screen on it and a slower processor, and less memory."" And you assume that the software will somehow just come alive on this product that you're dreaming of, but it won't. Because these app developers have taken advantage of the products that came before with faster processors, with larger screens, with more capabilities that they can take advantage of to make better apps for customers.",1
"So how do you think about your position from a marketing standpoint, a sales standpoint? Any changes you need to make, or how are you sort of addressing that?",1
"And it's a hard one because it throws you right back into the beginning of that chicken and egg problem again to change all the assumptions on those developers. Most of them will not follow you, most of them will say, ""I'm sorry, but I'm not going to go back and write a watered down version of my app just because you've got this phone that you can sell for $50 less and you're begging me to write software for it.""",1
"One more if I may, please, Steve? You now have more than $50 billion in cash. You're generating more than $20 billion a year in cash; it rests very comfortably on your balance sheet, earning less than 1% interest. What is your aspiration for that cash? And why are you not more open to returning some of that cash to shareholders in the form of buybacks or dividend?",1
"Of course that's been suggested to us. We strongly believe that one or more very strategic opportunities may come along that we're in a unique position to take advantage of because of our strong cash position. And I think we've demonstrated a really strong track record of being very disciplined with the use of our cash. We don't let it burn a hole in our pocket, we don't allow it to motivate us to do stupid acquisitions.",1
And so I think that we'd like to continue to keep our powder dry because we do feel that there are one or more strategic opportunities in the future. That's the biggest reason. And there are other reasons as well that we could go into. But that's the biggest one.,1
"From Cross Research, we'll hear from Shannon Cross.",1
"Steve and Tim, could you talk a little bit about the corporate opportunity? And what I'm looking for is sort how you're thinking about Apple as it's been positioned over the last several years, sort of more of a consumer focused, SMB focused company, but clearly there is a huge opportunity here with the iPad and the iPhone and probably at some point the Macs into the corporate world.",1
"And what is your experience then when you've gone non-exclusive from a subsidy and margin standpoint on the phone, have you had to give anything up in the past?",1
"Steve, you discussed competitors not matching Apple's price point so far on the tablet space. Why do you think you have an advantage on the price point for iPad versus the PC manufacturers?",1
"I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. Revenue was $3.6 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. The stores experienced very strong year-over-year growth in Mac and iPad sales, which was largely offset by decline in iPhone sales given the tough comparisons in the year-ago quarter when iPhone 4 was launched and compounded by speculation about a new iPhone this year. The stores generated record-breaking Mac results, with sales reaching 1.1 million compared to 874,000 in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 25%. And about half of the Macs sold in our stores during the September quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.",1
"Turning to iPad. We continue to be thrilled with its incredible momentum. We set a new record with sales of 11.1 million iPads during the September quarter compared to 4.2 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 166%. We've said from the beginning that the tablet market is a huge opportunity for Apple, and we are very excited with our current performance and the tremendous customer enthusiasm for iPad.",1
"We were pleased with the iPhone sales growth as we prepared for the transition to the iPhone 4S. We expected iPhone sell-through to decline sequentially from the June quarter as a result of new product rumors following the announcement at our Developers Conference in June that iOS 5 and iCloud would become available in the fall. As we predicted, iPhone sell-through did decline across the quarter especially in the second half as new product speculation intensified.",1
"We ended the quarter with about 5.75 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential decline of about 180,000, which places within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $11 billion during the quarter compared to $8.8 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 24%.",1
"Given the October launch of the iPhone 4S, we opted to defer new carrier and country additions from this September quarter until after the launch. As we indicated 2 weeks ago, we were very pleased to have recently added Sprint and KDDI to our carrier line up. These additions bring us to 230 carriers in 105 countries. For the sixth consecutive time, iPhone ranked highest in consumer reports, wireless consumer smartphone customer satisfaction survey, achieving the highest ratings for overall satisfaction as well as for performance, ease of operations, features and design.",1
"iPhone continues to be adopted as the standard across the enterprise with 93% of the Fortune 500 deploying or testing the device, up from 91% last quarter and 60% of the Global 500 testing or deploying iPhone, up from 57% last quarter. A recent example of iPhone's enterprise success is Lowe's. Lowe's is in the process of rolling out over 40,000 iPhones with a custom application to allow their store associates to execute realtime inventory checks, product orders and interactive customers with how-to videos.",1
"Additional examples of companies around the world supporting iPhone on their corporate networks include L'Oreal, Royal Bank of Scotland, SAP, Texas Instruments, Jacobs Engineering Group, Tenet Healthcare, Jaguar Land Rover, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Lincoln National and CSX Corporation. And of course, we're thrilled to begin shipping iPhone 4S this month.",1
"We are extremely enthusiastic about Siri, the iPhone 4 intelligent assistant that helps you get things done by just asking, and we think customers will love the performance of the iPhone 4S' dual-core A5 chip, all-new camera and full 1080p HD video recording. Now shipping in 7 countries, we are working hard to get iPhone 4S in customers' hands as quickly as possible. We look forward to rolling it out in 22 more countries by the end of this month.",1
"We launched iPad 2 in additional 20 countries, ending the September quarter with distribution in a total of 90 countries. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter were $6.9 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 146%.",1
"The iTunes Store generated record results with revenue in the quarter of almost $1.5 billion. The iTunes catalog continues to grow, and customers have downloaded over 16 billion songs and 650 million TV shows to date. We've also been very pleased with the growing popularity of the iBookstore with over 180 million downloads of iBooks to date.",1
"We ended the quarter with about 2.5 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about $1.45 million, which places within the target range of 4 to 6 weeks. It's been just 18 months since we introduced iPad and the pace at which businesses worldwide are adopting this technology is unprecedented. Today, 92% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPad within their enterprises, up from 86% last year. Internationally, 52% of the Global 500 are testing or deploying iPad, up from 47% last quarter.",1
"Every day, we learn about innovative new ways our enterprise customers are using iPad. The airline industry is a great example of the momentum we're seeing. United Continental Holdings is putting iPads in every cockpit to replace heavy, paper-based flight bags. In Japan, All Nippon Airways is now using iPad in training programs for flight attendants.",1
"Sonic Automotive is using iPad for customer check-in at the service department and also to provide analytics to regional managers. Aflac, Biogen and General Mills have developed internal apps that their field sales teams leverage daily, and technicians of Siemens Energy are bringing iPads along when they do maintenance work at the top of their wind turbines.",1
"Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed the 0.25 billion cumulative iOS device sales in the September quarter. We were very pleased to begin delivering iOS 5 last week and customers are loving its many new features, including Notification Center, iMessage, Newsstand and Reminders.",1
"We're also very excited to launch iCloud last week, with breakthrough services including iTunes in the Cloud, Photo Stream and Documents in the Cloud. We believe iCloud is the easiest way for customers to manage their content going far beyond anything else available today and early reviews have been excellent.",1
"The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 500,000 apps available and over 18 billion downloads to date. We expanded the App Store to 33 additional countries during the September quarter, ending with a total of 123 countries.",1
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were very pleased to sell 17.1 million iPhones compared to 14.1 million in the previous September quarter. This represents 21% year-over-year growth and a new September quarter record. We experienced particularly strong iPhone sales growth in our Asia-Pacific segment where iPhone sales more than doubled year-over-year.,1
"Moving to our music products. We sold 6.6 million iPods compared to almost 9.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Though down year-over-year, total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations and iPod touch continue to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD, and iPod continues to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory.",1
"Well, I think part of it is because we engineer so much of it ourselves. The A4 chip inside it is an Apple creation; everything, again, as I mentioned from the battery chemistry to the enclosures. And we've learned a lot. We've learned a lot from the miniaturization we've done on iPods and iPhones. And we're a very high volume consumer electronics manufacturer.",1
"I'd now like to turn the call over to Apple CEO, Tim Cook, for introductory remarks.",1
"So I think we've learned a lot. We've developed a lot of our own components where other have to buy them on the market with middlemen, getting their cut of things. I think we're systems architects and know how to build systems in a very efficient way. So I think this is a product we've been training for, for the last decade.",1

"Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apple Inc. Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2010, Form 10-Q for the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2011 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. This is our first earnings call since the passing of Steve Jobs. The world has lost a visionary, a creative genius and an amazing human being. Steve was a great leader and mentor and inspired everyone at Apple to do extraordinary things. His spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple, and we are dedicated to continuing the amazing work that he loved so much.",1
We launched Mac OS X Lion on July 20 and customer response has been tremendous with over 6 million Lion downloads during the September quarter. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory.,1
"Only Apple brings together software, hardware and services into such a powerful and integrated experience for our customers. As we move forward, we will continue doing that with relentless focus. I'd like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for all of the condolences and expressions of support that we have received following Steve's passing.",1
"With that, I'd like to turn over the call to Peter to discuss our Q4 results. Peter?",1
"Thank you, Tim. We are very pleased to report record September quarter revenues and earnings. We set a new all-time quarterly record for Mac and iPad sales, and we established a new September quarter record for iPhone sales. We're very proud of these results and with the momentum of our business.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $28.3 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 39%. The year-over-year increase was fueled primarily by strong growth in iPad, Mac and iPhone sales. Operating margin was $8.7 billion, representing 30.8% of revenue. Net income was $6.6 billion, increasing 54% year-over-year and translating to earnings per share of $7.05.",1
"Turning to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new all-time quarterly record with sales of 4.89 million Macs, exceeding the previous record set in the last December quarter by 760,000 Macs, representing a 26% increase over the year-ago quarter's results. That is more than 6x IDC's most recently published forecast of 4% growth for the PC market overall in the September quarter. Mac sales increased strongly in each of our operating segments led by Asia-Pacific with growth of 61% year-over-year.",1
"The increase in Mac sales was fueled by the very strong growth in MacBook Air as well as the continued strong performance of MacBook Pro. In July, we updated the MacBook Air with the next-generation processors, high-speed Thunderbolt I/O technology and a backlit keyboard. And while the portables represented 74% of the total Mac mix, we also generated record desktop sales in the quarter primarily due to continued strength of iMac.",1
"Let me -- maybe I can answer that in 2 ways. If you look at the channel inventory on iPhone that was there at the end of Q4, and so this is at the September 24 cutoff point for our quarter, that was the 5.75 million that Peter mentioned in his opening comments. Over half of that has already sold through. And so one portion of the things driving that is the elasticity question that you're getting at there. We also did in a very few countries last quarter, we dropped the 3GS price a bit early particularly in some of the prepaid markets to see what would occur on those markets, and we were extremely pleased with the results. It gave us even more conviction to follow through with the plan change that we made earlier in October.",1
"Thank you, Chris. A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are (888) 203-1112 or (719) 457-0820. Please enter confirmation code 2922403. These replays will be available beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.",1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at (408) 974-1896. And financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at (408) 974-4570, and I'm at (408) 974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
"Hey, thanks, good afternoon. Tim, maybe comment on the component environment a little bit particularly, related to the iPad, iPad Mini and iPhone and just where you see some of the constraints perhaps here as youâre launching. And then Peter, the quick one for you, the volatility on the OI&E line. is that just the calendar third quarter and calendar fourth quarter issue, and then it normalizes or is that going to continue? Thanks.",1
"Steve, itâs Peter. When we set out the bill, the iPad Mini, we didnât set out the bill to small cheap tablet, we set out the bill to smaller iPad that offers the full iPad experience as our customers would expect. As a result, the difference between the iPad Mini and the competition is profound, our iPad Mini begins with a 7.9 inch display, which is 35% larger than 7 inch tablets, providing a much better experience. Weâre shipping two great cameras: FaceTime HD front and a 5 megapixel of 1080p iSight rear camera versus typically a one from our competition. We are shipping our fastest communications with dual-band Wi-Fi and have included the A5 chip, which has higher performance than our competitors. And finally, the fit and finish of our precision, unibody aluminum closure is breathtaking when held in your hands.",1
"And so thatâs what weâve done. The iPad Mini has higher costs and the gross margin is significantly below our cooperate average, weâre beginning the higher cost curve, but in addition to wanting to make a large number, weâre going to work to try and get down the cost curves and be more efficient in manufacturing as we have been in the past with our other products.",1
"Steve, one of the things we try to do is to create a product that people will love for months and years after they purchase it and continue using it in a robust way. So thatâs what iPad Mini has been designed to do. And you can really see that more broadly on iPad by looking at the usage statistics, as I had mentioned earlier this week, over 90% of the web traffic from tablets are from iPad. And so, Apple will not make a product that somebody may feel good about it for the moment that theyâre paying for it and then when they get it home, they really ever use AVR, thatâs not what weâre about, itâs not a kind of experience we want our customers to have. And I think when you â I would encourage you to use an iPad Mini and I donât think youâll be using anything other than maybe another iPad or something after you do that.",1
"I look forward to it. could you comment on your enterprise opportunity or obviously a lot of its BYOD, but you have many retailers, you have a corporate director to use iPads and so forth. are you doing anything a little bit more aggressive to support that market particularly with the Windows pads now coming out?",1
"We now have almost all of the Fortune 500 that are testing or deploying iPad and I think with the recent announcements, the penetration will only grow. Weâve also pushed fairly aggressively in the Global 500. And so those numbers now are above 80% on both iPhone and iPad. And so I feel like we are doing fairly well there, there is clearly much more to do. But Iâm feeling pretty good about it.",1
"From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, weâll hear from Scott Craig.",1
"Scott, itâs Tim. In terms of iPad and iPhone, I donât see a component shortage getting us for the quarter in the numbers that weâve given you in the guidance. I think we saw some challenges there and feel good about our position. In terms of general shortages on the iMac, weâll be constrained for the full quarter in a significant way, part of that is that weâre beginning shipping the 21.5-inch iMac in November and the 27-inch in December. And so there will be a short amount of time during the quarter to manufacturer and ramp those and I expect the demand to be robust. So we will have a significant shortage there. the others are more based on how big is big from a demand point of view and that is very difficult to predict, but you can tell that weâre extremely bullish on the demand with the revenue guidance that Peter talked about earlier. Hopefully that answers your question.",1
Weâll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS.,1
Yes. Thanks.,1
"Hey, Scott. This is Gary. Iâll take the OI&E question. Okay, Iâll expand on Peterâs remarks just a little bit while interest income was above what we expected, foreign exchange hedging expense was higher than we expected relative to our guidance. without getting overly detailed, dollar weakness late in the quarter and accounting rules required us to accelerate and recognize a large amount of foreign exchange premium expense related to future quarter hedges in the current quarter. All things being equal, premium expense in Q1 should be lower. This has been factored into our December OI&E guidance of $380 million.",1
"Thanks, Gary and thanks, Scott. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"From ISI Group, weâll hear from Brian Marshall.",1
"Great, thanks guys. If you look at the iPhone, unit growth versus the revenue growth, thatâs been a pretty similar dynamic over the past several quarters, but when you look at that same dynamic for the iPad, itâs actually started to breakdown slightly over the past couple of quarters in fact, this most recent quarter, it looks like revenues grew three times faster than the unit growth. So I guess the question is, is this just simply the market migrating down to the sort of low-end of this skew stack or just less accessories from an attached or dollar spent in that and a quick follow up.",1
"Brian itâs Peter. I didn't quite follow your three times, but the iPhone ASPs were relatively flat in the September quarter, year-on-year and were up slightly on a sequential basis. The iPad ASPs were down year-over-year in a low double-digit way, but this really was reflective of our price reduction on the iPad 2 the stronger dollar and a little bit of change in mix and that's what drove the ASP change year-over-year on a sequential basis. iPad ASPs were actually pretty flat.",1
"Thank you very much. Regarding the iPad, you said that you priced it very aggressively. I think many people on The Street seem to have a slightly different view. Could you maybe talk a little about your pricing philosophy? And was it driven by cost? Or is it just more to keep up a premium brand, given the quality of your products?",1
"Thanks, Mark. Can we have the next question please?",1
I think it's important to remember there that we launched iPhone 5 in the U.S. during the quarter and where we launched in some international countries the bulk of the world we did not launch it yet and so I would have expected to have seen a more significant growth in the U.S. versus the rest of the world.,1
"Okay, great, thank you, and then my follow-up question is given what weâre seeing in margins that some of these products get more expensive to produce to be competitive, would you be open to passing some of those cost on to customers and obviously historically youâve announced new products and maintain a lot of those price points?",1
Moving on weâll hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.,1
"Hey good afternoon. Tim, can you talk a little bit about the iPad we saw a deceleration in September quarter. Was there anything in particular that might have been, as do you think about that business might have been driving that?",1
"The June to September was 17 million to 14 million Gene and the first thing to know there is that as we had talked about in the July call, the June quarter contained 1.2 million increase in channel inventory and so the actual sell through sequentially looks, the comparison looks very different than the our reported sell in numbers do, the second thing is that the $14 million exceeded what we had expected to do in iPad and the reason we had expected it to decline is that we believe based on the two or three years of results that weâve got is that normally, we would see a seasonal reduction in the September quarter versus the June quarter, a part of this reason is because K-12 heavily buys in the June quarter, K-12 doesnât buy very much in the September quarter, it becomes the Higher Ed kind of move and Higher Ed is still buying notebooks for the most part, and so there is some kind of normal seasonal thatâs exaggerated further when we announced the new product in March and have an enormous full quarter of demand in the June quarter and then when you compare that to the September quarter there would be natural phase down.",1
"In addition to all of that, people itâs clear that customers delayed purchases of tablets due to new product rumors and this intensified in August and September. Some of that was anticipated and some of it I wish wouldnât occur. But it did occur.",1
And so thatâs how we would explain the sequential difference. On a year-over-year basis because of the year ago quarter having also a channel inventory build as we stock the channel to the profit level the sell through year-over-year actually grew 44% and so the underlying sell through was extremely strong.,1
"And so we continue to feel great about how iPad has done and with announcing the fourth generation iPads just as we and adding iPad Mini to the family, we think itâs going to be an incredible holiday season.",1
"Itâs a hypothetical question, hence so we think, weâve made great choices on the product and the prices and as you know our customary practice, long-standing customary practice is just to guide for the current quarter, and so I would want to talk about what we might do post that.",1
"What we did initially Mark, as we planned the first 30 to 40 countries prior to introducing the product and roll those out across at September in two different dates. The balance of the quarter, we planned with an eye toward the supply and what we think the demand will be. But we do plan these in advance and so it is not a prÃ©cised science. And we obviously have to plan those with several weeks of notice. And so occasionally, it can be different than what we think.",1
"Thanks, Gene.",1
"Thank you, Gene. We have the next question please?",1
"From JPMorgan, weâll go to Mark Moskowitz.",1
"Yeah, thank you, good afternoon. Peter or Tim my first question is around the sequential guidance for revenue of around 44% quarter-on-quarter for December. Can you provide us some context about how we should think about the iPad and the iPhone families in particular? How their revenue growth could [down tail] of that 44%?",1
"Hi, Mark. Itâs Peter. Youâre asking the sequential question, but I do want just to remind everybody that if you are looking at this year-over-year and comparing the sequential year-over-year, donât forget about the 14th week, last year in Q1, you need to adjust for that. And I think it would give you a different answer, if you were comparing anything year-over-year. Specifically, your question about iPhone and iPad sequentially, we have just announced amazing new products in both lineups and we expect large sequential increases, going from the September to December quarter. And as a result, whatâs real to be providing guidance tonight for $52 billion of revenue.",1
"Okay. And then Tim, question on the iPhone 5, as far as just the global rollout, what is the approach, the approach is the first touch all 100 countries and have supply constraints, impacting all 100 countries first and then go back and back still all those different outlets or will there be certain markets where you decide to kind of reach the supply-demand equilibrium first, and then keep similar sort of 100 countries kind of at constrained levels. Iâm just kind of curious about the efforts there in terms of. In terms of (inaudible) first sprinkle the product everywhere and then back the later or will it be more targeted?",1
"Great thanks, and then a quick follow-up is, looks like this is the second quarter in a row that the United States iPhone activations is actually growing faster than the international market that kind of seems like a strange dynamic considering the magnitude of the turn of the international being order magnitude larger than the U.S., one of you could comment on that, thanks.",1
"Thanks Brian, could we have the next question please.",1
"Okay, and then just my quick follow-up is on Apple TV we havenât heard about your hobby in [Vaio] how many did you sell in the quarter and whatâs the strategy there for the living room to-date and Iâm intrigued to hear the answer or not an answer?",1
"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you very much for joining us. We are eager to share with you the results of the final quarter of Appleâs fiscal 2013 with a strong finish to an amazing year and Peter will provide details about the September quarter shortly.",1
"Kulbinder, the sequential declining in gross margin that we see in the December quarter is largely being driven by many new form factor changes and some price reductions that weâve taken that I went through in great detail. And we believe that over 80% of the revenue that we will see in the December quarter will come from products that weâve just introduced in the last six weeks. And so while having lower gross margins on a new product is not something thatâs new for us. What is different this time is just a sheer number of new products that weâve introduced in the last six weeks. And we just have not had that magnitude in the past. So I donât see something thatâs structurally different. And we have a big focus on wanting to make a lot of these products to get them in customersâ hands as quickly as we can. But we are often going to work to try and get down the cost curves and improve manufacturing and other efficiencies as we have successfully done in the past. So no change in what weâre going to try and work on. And weâll report to you in January how we did.",1
"Thank you, Kulbinder. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks as a Podcast on the iTunes Store, as the webcast on Apple.com/investor and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820; please enter confirmation code 8834583. These replays will be available by approximately 5:30 p.m. Pacific Time today.

"Please standby, we are about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, Iâd like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today are Appleâs CEO, Tim Cook; and CFO, Peter Oppenheimer and they will be joined by Vice President and Corporate Controller, Luca Maestri for Q&A session with analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information youâll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Appleâs Form 10-K for 2012, the Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of 2013 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"But first Iâm happy to tell you that Appleâs business is stronger than ever. We are in a unique position of having world class hardware, software and service skills under one road, which enables us to provide an unparallel user experience to 100s of millions of customers. And working with our vibrant developer community, weâve built a large and thriving ecosystem.",1
"On your question about iPad Mini, the comment that I think youâre referencing are comments that Steve had made before about 7-inch tablet. And let me be clear, we would not make one of the 7-inch tablets. We donât think theyâre good products, and we would never make one. Not just because itâs 7-inches, but for many reasons. One of the reasons however, is size, and so I am not sure if you saw our keynote. But the difference in just the realistic size between the 7.9, almost 8 versus 7 is 35%. And when you look at the usable area, itâs much greater than that. Itâs from 50% to 67%. And also, the iPad Mini has the same number of pixels as iPad 2 does.",1
"We are winning with our products in all the ways that are most important to us, in customer satisfaction, in product usage and in customer loyalty. Our relentless focus on providing innovation that enhances our customerâs lives is evident in extraordinary list of products that weâve launched in just the last couple of months.",1
"From the colorful iPhone 5c and forward thinking iPhone 5s to the powerful new iMac, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro to the stunning iPad Mini with Retina display and the dramatically thinner, lighter and more powerful iPad Air.",1
"Thanks to a deep collaboration between our design and engineering teams. We also launched iOS 7 with a stunning new redesign, powerful new features and a great new service called iTunes Radio. We introduced OS X Mavericks bringing new core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and performance to our Mac and we introduced next generation iLife and iWork apps for iOS and OS X. And weâre making all of this incredible software free because we want our customers to have access to the greatest new features. All of these are products that only Apple could have delivered and most companies would be proud to just have one of them.",1
"Looking back, weâre very pleased with Appleâs many accomplishments during fiscal 2013. Our customers had an incredible response to our product line up, buying a 150 million iPhone, 71 million iPads and 16 million Macs across the fiscal year.",1
We expanded the breadth and depth of our ecosystem and we generated over $16 billion revenue from iTunes software and services. We also welcomed almost 400 million visitors to our retail stores and opened or remodeled 49 new stores and for the second year in a row we produced over $50 million in revenue per store.,1
"We generated record total company revenue of $171 billion, earnings of $37 billion and operating cash flow of $54 billion. We paid over $8 billion in capital expenditures to both to our supply chain, expand our infrastructure and increased our retail footprint. We also completed 15 strategic acquisitions. Thatâs an average of one acquisition every three to four weeks.",1
"And so you have access to all 275,000 apps that are in our App Store that have been custom-designed to take advantage of the four (inaudible). And so iPad Mini is the fantastic product. itâs not a compromised product like the 7-inch tablets; itâs in our whole different leap.",1
"Thanks. My first question, I guess is for Tim. Just in terms on the iPad Mini, there has obviously been a fair amount of debate within Apple over the years whether to even do the smaller screen iPad. And I guess, can you just speak about what youâve learned over the last couple of years as to why the time for that now is right, or was the technology is right? Just any insight there will be helpful. And then for Peter, my question is on gross margin thatâs when we revisit it slightly in the sense that you guys have spoken about various higher cost structures before as well in the loop from I think the 3G as to the fall in the iPhone. And even when the iPad I think was launched. During the end, what weâve seen is that the scaled Apple building, tighter revenues are getting to the component we use as, do you actually very quickly got through these potential gross margin dips. Is anything scripturally different this time around many things?",1
"From Bank of Montreal, weâll go to Keith Bachman.",1
"Thank you Keith. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"Hi thank you. A clarification question, will the iPhone 5 launch in Mainland China occur in the December quarter?",1
"Keith, it's Tim. Yes we project that it will occur in December.",1
"Okay thanks and the clarification on top of that, did you comment that you think you'll be able to meet supply of iPhone's at the end of the December quarter or do you think that you will end the quarter with backlogs of iPhone 5, or iPhones I should just say it's as a product's category?",1
"I'm actually not projecting whether supply and demand will balance for the quarter, I'm saying that I feel great about where we are on the manufacturing ramp that our supply output is significantly higher than it was earlier in October, and I'm confident that we'll be able to supply quite a few during the quarter, but in terms of where that, when that balance occurs, I can't tell at this point.",1
Okay,1
Demand is very robust.,1
"Thanks very much. Tim I wanted to go back to the iPad one more time if I could, specifically I wanted to ask or try to give us a feel for your view around the emerging model in the tablets base where vendors are willing to subsidize their hardware with content or search, where many of these vendors are selling hardware that break-even or even a loss and hoping they make it up on the back end, how is that impacting your iPad business if at all and is that something Apple would consider going forward?",1
Weâll go to Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.,1
"We've seen low-cost challenges before and iPad continues to beat every other tablet on the market, it can be any price and so we think customers are very smart, we think they have very high expectations, we think that they want a device that can do more and we are confident that our focus on making the best product is what will win at the end of the day and so we will stay true to that.",1
"Okay and then my second question I wanted to ask about the supply, it sounds like you've made a lot of changes to your supplier list as these new products are ramping perhaps due to strategic reasons and is that creating an added layer of complexity as you try to ramp these new products and to what extent is that contributing perhaps to the higher cost structure of these products?",1
"I'm not sure what you're trying to get out there, but I would not say that there has been a significant change in our supplier partners. There is always some change obviously, but I wouldn't describe any change as significant and there hasn't been a change that would have driven more cost, if thatâs your specific question.",1
I was specifically asking about LCD in your Samsung relationship?,1
"LCD, I wouldnât characterize any change there, itâs having driven any cost. And Samsung, we continue to be a customer of Samsung and continue to have a commercial relationship.",1
Welcome.,1
"Or not you might guess, for Q4 we sold 1.3 million that is up over a 100% year-on-year that means that we sold up more than 5 million Apple TVs during the fiscal year, which is almost double the previous year, we have sold 2.8 the previous year and so the business continues to do very well, but if you look at the size of revenue of this business versus our other businesses, itâs quite small and so it still has the (inaudible) label, however itâs below Toby and we continue to focus on it and continue to believe there is something more there and continue to pull the string to see where it takes us.",1
"So, no, but the way that we look at this is that we provide a fantastic iPad Touch, we provide an incredible fourth generation iPad and iPad Mini and then iPad 2. Customers will decide which one or two or three or all four that they would like and will buy those and so weâve learned over the years not to worry about cannibalization of our own products, itâs much better for us to do that than somebody else to do it and the far, far bigger opportunity here are the 80 million to 90 million PCs that are being sold per quarter, thereâs still over 300 million PCs being bought per year, and I think a great number of those people would be much better of buy an iPad or a Mac, and so thatâs a much bigger opportunity for Apple, and so instead of being focused on cannibalizing ourselves, and I look at it in much more that itâs an enormous incremental opportunity for us and so thatâs how I look at it.",1
"Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1
"With iCloud, customers can access their music, photos, calendars, contacts, documents and more from whatever device they are using. And it is built into every new iOS device and every new Mac. And we launched iOS6 last month, and itâs already on over 200 million devices. iOS 6 includes over 200 new features, including broader language support for Siri, Facebook integration, shared photo streams and more. Weâve made a number of improvements in maps over the past month, and we will work non-stop until maps lives up to our incredibly high standards.",1
"Earlier this week, we introduced the iPad Mini, the thinnest, lightest, smallest iPad weâve ever build. it has all the power, performance and capability, customers have come to expect from an iPad and you can hold it in one hand. We also introduced the fourth generation iPad with the beautiful 9.7-inch Retina display, an A6 chip with twice the performance of the iPad we announced earlier this year.",1
"Together with the iPad 2, these two new iPads run more than 275,000 apps in the App Store. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was 7.5 billion compared to 6.9 billion in the year-ago quarter and the increase of 9%. we ended the quarter with about 3.4 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 200,000, which left as just over our four weeks of iPad channel inventories, target on a look-back basis.",1
"iPad is fundamentally changing work processes across industries around the world. With apps developed in-house, iPad is helping companies deliver better service; streamline manufacturing and then power workforces with critical data and information.",1
"Volkswagen has developed more than 30 in-house apps for vital processes across the company including monitoring and tracking of vehicles on the production line, scheduling the vehicle transportation at assembly plants and greeting customers when they pick up new cars. Ping An Insurance in China has deployed thousands of iPads to their sales agents and service teams.",1
"Apps developed in-house are used by car accident inspectors to carry out onsite inspections involve claims, which significantly shortens processing time and improves customer satisfaction. In Brazil, Banco Bradesco is using iPads to redefine the customer experience in their bank branches. Beyond completing customer transaction, employees use iPad to inform and educate customers about bank services, and Bradesco apps in the App Store.",1
"Combining iPhones, iPads and iPod touch, we sold over 44 million iOS devices in the September quarter. The App Store now offers more than 700,000 apps, including over 275,000 apps specifically for iPad. We established a new all-time record for quarterly app sales in the September quarter, and we were very pleased to report that we have reached $6.5 billion in cumulative payments to developers. Customers are embracing iPad in growing numbers. With over 190 million account sign ups in the first year of the service.",1
"I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue was $4.2 billion, which is a new September quarter record and an increase of 18% over the year-ago quarter, with growth yield primarily by the storeâs best iPhone launch ever. The stores also established a new quarterly record for Mac sales, selling just over 1.1 million Macs. We opened a total of 18 new stores in 10 countries during the quarter, including our first store in Sweden. We also opened our second store at Hong Kong, at Festival Walk overwhelming response, resulting in our biggest store opening of the year.",1
"And news organizations around the world are using iPhone to transform the way they capture and deliver news. reporters for BBC, the Wall Street Journal, Mexican newspaper, Milenio and Canadaâs CTV News are using their iPhone cameras to capture HD video on location and send it directly back to headquarters for broadcast on TV or streaming on the web.",1
"We exited the quarter with 390 stores, 140 of which are outside the United States. With an average of 376 stores open, average revenue per store was $11.2 million, compared to $10.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Segment margin was $848 million, compared to $652 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted 94 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, compared to 77.5 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 22%. That translates to an average of 19,000 visitors per store, per week.",1
"Total company gross margin was 40%, which was 150 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this difference was due to better than expected, commodity and other costs. Another quarterly difference was due to leverage on the higher-than-expected sales and more favorable foreign exchange. The remainder was due to some items that we do not expect to recur in the December quarter.",1
"Operating expenses were $3.5 billion, and included $379 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was a net expense to $51 million. The interest income and investment gains were more than offset by higher-than-expected currency hedging expense. Under the accounting rules, foreign exchange fluctuations late in the quarter required us to accelerate recognition of premium expense related to Q1 and Q2 hedges. This will result in less premium expense being recognized in Q1 and Q2 the tax rate for the quarter was 24.5%, bringing us to a tax rate for the full fiscal year of 25.2%.",1
"Turning to cash, our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $121.3 billion at the end of the September quarter, compared to $117.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, a sequential increase of over $4 billion. The increase in cash was net of $2.5 billion of dividend paid in August. About $83 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the September quarter. Cash flow from operations was $9.1 billion. Our board of directors have declared a dividend of $2.65 per common share, payable on November 15, 2012. The shareholders of recorded as of the close of business on November 12, 2012.",1
"In August, we entered into a rule 10b5-1 compliant accelerated share repurchase program, with the financial institution to purchase out the $2 billion of Apple stock during fiscal year â13.",1
"In addition to shares purchased through the accelerated share repurchase program, we may also purchase shares in open market transaction in compliance with our applicable securities laws. As we move ahead into the December quarter, Iâd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. As a reminder, year-over-year comparison will be impacted by the fact that our December quarter this year will span 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter last year included a 14th week.",1
"Turning to iPad, we were very pleased with sales of 14 million iPads during the September quarter compared to 11.1 million in the year ago quarter and the increase of 26%. iPad sales were ahead of our expectations and we saw a strong year-over-year growth in iPad sales in every geographic region.",1
"Canon has provided its field sales team iPhones with secure access to its customer relationship management system, sales reps can now access customer information and input meeting notes anywhere giving them more time with customers. Amtrak has deployed thousands of iPhones to train conductors, the use an in-house app that changes the entire ticketing and reporting workflow. The app enabled print-at-home ticket validation delivers a more accurate passenger manifest and makes the accounting data available to Amtrakâs revenue systems in near real time, revolutionizing the paper-based process, the company used in the past.",1
"We expect OpEx to be about $4.05 billion including about $485 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be about $380 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. We are targeting EPS of about $11.75.",1

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
And I'd now like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.,1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report the results of our fourth fiscal quarter. We established a new September quarter records for iPhone, iPad and Mac unit sales, leading to our highest September quarter revenue and earnings ever.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $36 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 27%. That's a $7.7 billion increase over the prior September quarterâs results and was driven primarily by strong growth in iPhone and iPad sales.",1
"Operating margin was $10.9 billion, representing 30.4% of revenue. Net income was $8.2 billion, increasing 24% over the prior September quarter's result. The quarter's net income translated to diluted earnings per share of $8.67.",1
"Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We sold over 4.9 million Macs establishing a new September quarter record. This represents 1% growth year-over-year compared to IDC's latest published estimate of 8% contraction of the global personal computer market in the September quarter.",1
"Earlier this week we unveiled the stunning new design for iMac that packed high performance technology and a brilliant new display with reduced reflection into an incredibly sleek aluminum and glass enclosure. We also introduced an even thinner and lighter version of our most popular Mac, the 13-inch MacBook Pro, featuring a retina display with over 4 million pixels in all flash storage. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory which is below our target range of four to five weeks.",1
"Recognized revenue from iPhone handsets and accessories sales was $17.1 billion during the quarter compared to $11 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 56%. Businesses around the world continue to make iPhone, an essential device for their employees. Virtually, every type of enterprise in the small business is using iPhone along with the business apps from the app store and custom apps developed in-house to drive efficiencies that were simply not possible before.",1
"Moving to our music products, we sold 5.3 million iPods compared to 6.6 million in the year ago quarter. iPod touch continue to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the September quarter based on the latest data published by MPD and iPod continue to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.",1
"Weâre very excited to be shipping our newest iPods as of two weeks ago. The new iPod touch is the thinnest iPod touch yet, comes in five great colors and features of 4-inch Retina display, a 5 megapixel iSight camera, our powerful A5 chip and Siri. The new iPod Nano is the thinnest iPod ever featuring a 2.5-inch Multi-Touch display, convenient navigation buttons, and built-in Bluetooth for wireless listening. The Nano comes in seven great new colors and we think our full range of iPods will make wonderful gifts this holiday season.",1
"The iTunes Store generated all time record results, with revenue almost $2.1 billion thanks to continued strong sales of music, apps and video. We look forward to launching the new iTunes featuring the completely redesigned player, seamless integration with iCloud and a new look for the iTunes Store. The new iTunes has a dramatically simpler and clearner interface, so customersâ music, movie and TV purchases on any of their iOS devices or computers are conveniently displayed in their iTunes library and are available whenever they want them.",1
"Iâd now like to turn to iPhone. weâre very pleased to have sold 26.9 million iPhones compared to 17.1 million in the previous September quarter. That represents 58% year-over-year growth compared to IDCâs latest published estimate of 45% growth for the smartphone market overall during the quarter. We launched iPhone 5 in nine countries on September 21 and 22 more countries on September 28, and demand has been phenomenal.",1
"Customers have responded tremendously to the iPhone 5 all-new slim and light design and beautiful new 4-inch Retina display, the powerful performance of the A6 chip and the great new ultrafast wireless technology. Demand for iPhone 5 continues to outstrip supply, and we are working very hard to get more into customerâs hands as quickly as possible.",1
"We ended the quarter with about $9.1 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 800,000 iPhones and ended the quarter below our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look-forward basis.",1
"As we indicated previously, revenue in that 14th week last year was approximately one 14th of the quarterâs total revenue. We expect revenues to be about $52 billion compared to $46.3 billion in the December quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 36% reflecting approximately $90 million related to stock-based compensation expense.",1
"In closing, weâre extremely proud to conclude an amazing fiscal year 2012. We generated revenue of over $156 billion, which is up 45% year-over-year, and reflects growth of $48 billion in revenue.

"Yeah, I knew, I do, Iâd messed up in my speech there sorry.",1
"Thanks, Tony.",1
"Tony, itâs Tim. In regard to your first question, we still continue to anticipate rolling out to the 100 countries as we announced before, it is our fastest rollout ever; there will be some large countries in month of December. But we anticipate still achieving the 100. In terms of costs, with each new product we see learning curves associated with ramping production.",1
"And the new products we have now are no exception to that, the difference is the number of new products that we having moving in line. As Peter said, and as you can talk, the announcements weâve had the last couple of months, this is the most prolific period in our history in terms of the new product introduction and innovation; the past six weeks have been phenomenal in terms of new product introduction.",1
"And so we do see all of these costs associated with each of these. But I donât see those costs accelerating on a per unit basis. As we got through the quarter, I see it very much being a production ramp across many, many new products.",1
"Okay, thank you for that color. If I could just follow-up, youâve talked before about how you believe that the iPad will be, and the tablet market will be an enormous market, bigger than the PC market. Clearly, youâve made a move to expand that market and make it more accessible by introducing the iPad Mini. Iâm wondering if over time you could see this market evolving to larger tablets going forward that would address different needs in the marketplace, take on incremental PC functionality, and Iâm wondering when you talk about the iPad market being bigger than the PC market going forward, do you see larger form factors in the marketplace evolving, and I guess the question, is why not?",1
"Tony, as you know we donât comment on our future views on products and roadmaps etcetera. But let me make some comments on your question. We continue to be very confident that the tablet market will surpass the PC market, there is incredible development in both ecosystems and product going on in the tablet space. It is already extremely compelling for many, many customers to choose the tablet, in particular an iPad over a PC. And when you look at the size of the PC market, there is an enormous opportunity for Apple there. Pretty much each quarter you see 80 to 90 million PCs being sold.",1
"And so we do think that the iPad and the iPad Mini, and the iPad 2 will all be extremely attractive offering for people in lieu of PC. And we are going to continue to very much focus on the future of iPad, and we are very, very confident with what we have in the pipeline. And we are extremely pleased to have launched iPad Mini; and canât wait until next Friday, when we begin selling the very first unit.",1
"Thank you very much. Tim or Peter could you talk a little bit about China, and what youâre seeing in China fairly with your revenue guidance, it sounds like it remained strong, but obviously thereâs been some mixed signal from an economic standpoint?",1
Next weâll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.,1
"Yeah Shannon, itâs Tim. In terms of what we saw in China for Q4, revenue was $5.7 billion, thatâs up 26% year-on-year, Mac was up extremely strong, up 44%. As you recall, we launched portables for the first time in July or the portables that we have previously announced in U.S. in June, we announced that in China in July. iPad was up 45% in Greater China, iPhone was up 38%. And so all in all, a fantastic quarter that brings us to a full year fiscal year revenue number of $23.8 billion for China which is really phenomenal, when you think about it, thatâs up over $10 billion year-on-year up 78% and Greater China now represents about 15% of Apple for the fiscal year and so weâre extremely happy with how weâve done in China as Peter alluded to in his opening remarks, we are continuing to invest in our own retail stores there, we continue to expand distribution in with channel partners as well, and we continue to see it as a extremely exciting market with more and more people wanting Apple product.",1
"Great, and then I just had a follow-up question on the Tablet market, with the launch of Surface today and obviously the Win 8 Tablet of Mac, could you talk a little bit about what are you seeing, from a competitive standpoint and how you think about it? Thank you.",1
"Yeah, I havenât personally played with the Surface yet, but what weâre reading about it is that itâs a fairly compromised confusing product, and so I think one of the toughest things you do with deciding which product is to make hard trade off and decide what a product should be and weâve really done that with the iPad, and so the user experience is absolutely incredible, I suppose you could design a car that flies and floats, but I donât think it would do all of those things very well, and so I think people when they look at the iPad versus competitive offerings are going to conclude, they really want an iPad and I think people have done that to-date and I think they will continue to do that.",1
"Thanks, Shannon, can we have the next question please?",1
"Thanks a lot, appreciate it. Can you just go through a little bit more on tablets, the iPad Mini, how do you think that will sell versus the original iPad form factor and how do you want to differentiate that is there more of an eBook focus with and education focus with the Mini and do you think it will sell more than the regular or the original iPad and how do you want us to just think about the cannibalization factor as well of the older product or the older form factor?",1
"We donât really have an old product, then we have only new product, we just announced the fourth generation iPad as well andâ¦",1
"Yes, thank you. I just wanted to first follow-up on that previous question around the ramp of iPhone. Do you continue to anticipate rolling out to all 100 countries this quarter as you had announced at the time of the iPhone 5 announcement. And related to that can you comment on whether the supply constraints that youâve had, have had a material impact on your cost of goods sold relative. So as your supply improves, do you actually expect your cost of goods sold to decline?",1
"Hi Bill, itâs Tim. The demand for iPhone is extremely robust, we are thrilled with what we see; we are in a significant state of backlog right now. In terms of the production, our output has improved significantly since earlier this month. And Iâm very, very pleased with the progress that weâve made there; Iâm pleased with the current level of output in what is the largest volume ramp in Appleâs history. Itâs difficult to predict when supply and demand will balance, but Iâm feeling very confident on our ability to supply quite a few iPhones.",1
"We sold a record $18 million Macs and shipped 35 million iPods. And we expanded the reach of iTunes music stores to 63 countries around the world. We launched stunning new versions of OS X and iOS, and time it altogether; we launched iPod with customers reaching over 190 million and growing.",1
"This has been the case with new products in the past, so nothing new. The difference this time is the sheer number of new products we are introducing in a very short period of time. Additionally, we lowered the price of the iPhone 4S and iPhone 4, delivering incredible value to our customer.",1
"And finally, we generated net income of $41.7 billion, an increase of 61% year-over-year. We enter this holiday season with our strongest product lineup ever and remain very confident in our new product pipeline.",1
"Thank you, Peter. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?",1
"Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. If your guidance comes to fruition, December will be the first quarter in a very long time, but Apple EPS declined year-on-year despite what has been the broadest product refresh in the companyâs history over the past two months, the [bares] will point out that may be the companyâs price premium or supply kind of advantage is weakening, so just curious how you would respond to that? And then as a follow-up, Peter if you can comment on whatâs driving the significant gross margin down-tick in December given you should have decent iPhone mix? Thank you.",1
"Sure. Katy, let me begin, Iâll address many of the things you asked, and then Tim can add a few points. The change year-over-year is being driven by a couple of things, so first of all, last year included a 14th week, this yearâs Q1 is a normal 13-week quarter. That along with a stronger U.S. dollar, and the change in gross margin, so let me talk to you about what we see for gross margin, but Iâm going to go through some detail on a sequential basis, but not year-over-year.",1
"As you pointed out, this is the most prolific product period in Appleâs history. We have an unprecedented number of new product introductions over the last six weeks, and this has led to record levels of demand. New or re-priced versions of our products announced during this time frame represent over 80% of the total expected December quarter revenue.",1
"But there are costs associated with such dramatic change and demand. The iPhone 5, iPad Mini, iMac, MacBook Pro 13-inch, iPod Touch and iPod Nano have completely new form factors with great new features, and weâve never before introduced so many new form factors at once. All of these products have higher costs than their predecessors, and therefore lower gross margins as they are at the height of the cost curve.",1
"We head into this holiday quarter with the strongest iPhone line-up that we have ever had with the iPhone 4 starting at three in the subsidized markets. We also added the iPad Mini to our iPad line-up. The iPad Mini has the full iPad experience, and we priced it aggressively at $329, delivering incredible value to our customers. Its gross margin is significantly below the corporate average.",1
"Okay, great. Thanks. Can you walk through how youâre thinking about the supply ramp for the iPhone 5 in the holiday quarter? And how does some of the challenges youâre facing relative to the strong demand compared to the past iOS product launches?",1
"So in summary, we expect our gross margin to decline by about 400 basis points sequentially. We expect the benefit from positive leverage on a sequentially higher revenue and a greater mix of iPhone, but we expect these benefits will be more than offset by a number of factors.",1
"First, margins on new products are lower than their predecessors including the iPhone 5 and we have been aggressive with the iPad Mini. Second, weâve lowered the price of the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 4. Third, we will experience transitionary cost associated with multiple new product ramp. Fourth, the high anticipated volume of iPhone and other new products will generate significantly greater deferred revenue sequentially.",1
"As you are aware, we defer a portion of our revenue with every device we sell, and amortize it back into revenue over the life of the device. In periods of exceptionally strong sales like the December quarter, the deferred amounts are significantly higher than the revenue amortized in from past sales. And fifth, the favorable items that benefited the gross margin in the September quarter are not expected to repeat in the December quarter.",1
"We will work hard to try and get down the cost curves and improve our manufacturing and other efficiencies as we successfully have done in the past. We ended this holiday season with our strongest product line-up ever, and we have great choices for customers. To be in a position to anticipate over $50 billion of demand for our products in a single quarter is a reflection of the incredible strength of our products and our business.",1
"And Katy, if I could just add a couple of things to that. We are dedicated to making the very best products in the world, and we think about the smallest of details, and we are unwilling to cut corners in delivering the best customer experience to the world. Itâs this relentless commitment to innovation and excellence is the reason that our customers choose buy our products, and this will always be the driving force behind Apple. We are managing the company for the long-run and will continue to make great long-term decision. We remain very, very confident in our strategy, and will use our world-class skills and hardware, software and services to delight our customers.",1
Thanks for the details.,1
"Steve, it sounded like that wasn't really consistent with what you said. You said very clearly, we don't want to be Nokia, we just to want to make good phone. So perhaps, you can help me better understand how we should think about your aspiration for both the iPhone and the iPad. Steve, you also made a comment about seven inch screens aren't going to cut it, and implying that you're not going to go down to those lower price points.",1
"In your iPod business it was kind of the opposite. You had very high volume, you drove price points down to entry points in the marketplace. And you have more than 50% market share globally. I think when we've talked about it in the past, you've actually said that you view the iPhone business as being more akin to the iPod business in terms of your aspiration.",1
"I guess this is for both Steve and Tim. I wanted to just better understand your aspirations for iPhone and iPad. Tim, I think I've heard you say, ""Look, we think about the Mac business as being one where we make the best products, but we're competing against kind of strong income and power in Microsoft. And we don't aspire to have high market share.""",1
"Hi, thank you. Can you talk a bit about the Mac business? The channel inventory levels, what the mix has been, now that you have had a few months since the refresh of your line-up?",1
"Well, Mike, we feel great about how we ended the fiscal year with selling 7.4 million, as Peter talked about in the preamble. And that put us over 20 million -- almost 21 million for the fiscal year, which was up 78% from before. And so we have significant momentum.",1
"Also when you look at the ecosystem that weâve got with iTunes and the Apps store with the Apps store having over 85,000 apps, which is a country mile more than anyone else, plus the very strong product pipeline that we have, we feel very, very good about sitting up and competing against anyone.",1
Frankly I think that people are really just trying to catch up with the first iPhone that was announced two years ago and weâve long since moved beyond that.,1
"Were you pleasantly surprised at the mix of 3GS versus 99, and what did that tell you perhaps about the value proposition of Apple and how that drives iPhone going forward?",1
"As I indicated before, the demand for the 3GS did exceed our expectation and we quickly changed our orders for components, et cetera, that are different between the models. I think it shows that thereâs an intense appetite for Apple's latest technology and we were very pleased with the result.",1
We will hear from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"Sure, Shannon. This is Tim. Last quarter was the quarter of the portable, up 35% year over year compared to IDC at 9% and so we really had a blow out quarter for portables. It is the result of the line-up that we announced in June and as you know we had backlog in the quarter on that line.",1
From RBC Capital Markets we will hear from Mike Abramsky.,1
"Also the Mac itself via back-to-school which was the strongest back-to-school we had ever had, as Peter talked about, and the launch of Snow Leopard which occurred later in the quarter. So there was a group of things that came together to push us to a level above $3 million which was above our own expectations internally, or even some of our stretch targets.",1
"From a channel inventory point of view, we started the quarter between three and four weeks, we ended the quarter between three and four weeks and to be specific on the inventory change, so there is no misunderstanding, the inventory changed less than 15,000 units from beginning to end, so we had very minor growth, particularly when you compare that to the growth in sales from a sequential point of view.",1
"Great. Any idea of the penetration of Snow Leopard right now out in the installed base? I think Peter mentioned fewer shipments of box sales in the coming quarter, but any idea as to where you are at?",1
"The upgrade sales of Snow Leopard, which we include the family in the box set, were more than double what we experienced for Leopard over the same five-week initial sales period, so this doubling was much more than we had planned and were very pleasantly surprised by it.",1
Great. I guess the price cut worked. Thank you.,1
"Yes, it did. Thank you.",1
"Thanks very much. Tim, what are your thoughts in the holiday season, given the increase in competitive intensity against iPhone? Thereâs a lot of obviously wannabes that are coming to market in the season, particularly Android and many of them are offering touch screens and richer browsing and media and app stores and are being given carrier support. How do you think about maintaining your momentum and differentiation amidst that kind of environment?",1
"Thanks, Scott. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"Great, thanks guys. Last year you provided some commentary around longer-term gross margin trends. Do you have any thoughts on this for Fiscal 2010, or at least how we should think about this longer term?",1
Thatâs correct.,1
"Do you guys have any updated comments on the economy? Thatâs my last question. It seemed like the quarter must have closed very strong, especially with those Mac numbers.",1
We just spend our time projecting our business and leave the economy forecasting and comments to the economists.,1
Your next question comes from Gene Munster â Piper Jaffray.,1
"Weâre looking at the iPhone, itâs pretty clear weâre still in a greenfield opportunity here, but if you start to go to multiple carriers can you talk a little bit about the pricing of the phone when you go from exclusivity to multiple carriers? And obviously, not specific but any sort of color we can have in terms of pricing dynamics change on the phone from you to the carrier?",1
"Our pricing is confidential, Gene, so itâs not something I could comment on in detail but generally speaking from markets where weâre already selling I would not expect to see a wholesale price difference as we bring on other carriers. However, the end user price is really set by the carriers themselves so you may or may not see a street price difference.",1
"So when you go from exclusive to multiple carriers, you wouldnât necessarily see change in pricing that you are charging the carrier? Is that correct?",1
Scott Price from Banc of America.,1
"Scott, related to your tax question, our tax rate for the quarter was 26% and it was below our guidance of 30%, primarily due to a higher mix of foreign earnings. But for the year, we were about 29%. The past two years weâve been pretty much right on 30% so from what I see at this point for fiscal â10, weâll see about 30% for our tax rate, really consistent with what weâve seen in the last couple of years.",1
Scott Price - Banc of America,1
"Tim, I know you guys donât have a lot of experience with the seasonality of the iPhone business, but how do you think about the seasonality here into the fourth quarter?",1
And a question for Peter on tax. Can you walk us through why the tax rate is going to go up here in the near-term? Thanks.,1
"You know, as you said, when we looked at the September to December quarter, we have very few September to Decembers to look at in the iPhone business since weâve just been selling for a couple of years and in fact in the vast majority of countries, weâve only been selling [in one], and some of those just a partial; and so honestly speaking, we are new in the business still and I think for me to make any kind of seasonality forecast would not be a good idea.",1
"The things that we look at in terms of coming up with our forecasts would be the popularity of the iPhone 3GS has been phenomenal; we were very surprised by the demand. We were selling in 64 countries by the end of the quarter. Weâll roll out to some others this quarter, notably China, which has already been mentioned in the call. We hope to roll out in Korea as well and as Gene mentioned previously, we will be adding some carriers in some countries where we only had one carrier before, such as the United Kingdom and Canada, as an example.",1
So those are the things that we think about as we think about our December forecast.,1
From Credit Suisse we will hear from Bill Shope.,1
"I can give you some qualitative thoughts. For the December quarter I have guided to about 34%. I donât want to make forecasts today for future quarters on a quantitative basis, but I think there are two things that you have to be aware of.",1
"Weâre thrilled to be launching there on October 30th with China Unicom and weâre going to start with about 1,000 points of sale and then expand further over the next several months thereafter. Theyâve announced the plans and prices that theyâll have for the device and for the service. Thereâs a very wide range here on the post-paid side from $18 a month all the way up to $85, $100 a month. At the higher price point an individual is able to actually get the device for free and it goes up as you go down the ARPU, as it would in most countries.",1
"For the Mac we have a little less than 13,000 worldwide and our focus in terms of expansion in the in direct channel is much more so in the international market. As you probably could tell from our results we grew the Mac much stronger outside the US than inside the US and I am sure part of that is just the economic difference between the two. But, the international business, particularly in Europe and in Asia was extremely strong last quarter.",1
"Now, I would imagine that you have that typically in most Q4s and accordingly is that larger than usual for this quarter because your demand perception may have changed over the last 30 or 60 days, or is that just a normal sequential seasonal headwind to margins that you always experience?",1
"Itâs more than normal and so youâre correct that in general we spend more in freight in Q1. However, this increase is larger than usual. Iâm sorry I canât be specific on the product but itâs an abnormal sequential increase.",1
Your next question comes from Maynard Um â UBS.,1
"Can you just talk about how many non-Apple retail store distribution points you have and whether thereâs more growth there? Iâm just trying to think about the mix of your retail stores versus your indirect going forward. Then, I have a follow up question on CapEx.",1
Maynard is that specific to the Mac?,1
"To the Mac, yes.",1
"Okay, and just in particular, Europe, was that broad-based or Western or Eastern? Any more specifics on Europe?",1
"On the availability portion Toni, the iPhone 3GS demand outstripped the supply of the iPhone 3GS so I think you would probably put that in your first category of a good old fashioned demand issue which is a nice problem to have in the scheme of things. Now, because it was outstripping supply it creates component shortages as we go out to the market to secure more components. Generally speaking, the ones that are hardest to get are silicon and so it takes a little longer however, I was really happy that we were able to solve the bulk of these, the vast majority of them in September or in early October so I feel good about how we are positioned now.",1
"I can give you some highlights. If you look at the leads, Spain was extremely strong, which I know is going to be a surprise. It was over 40%. Germany was 40%, France was 39%, and so you had Western Europe less the U.K. extremely strong, a tremendous multiple from market growth, and even countries, Switzerland and Italy, were in the mid-30s and so several European countries, sizable countries were incredibly strong.",1
"Great, and then just on the CapEx, it was about 4.7% of your sales and Iâm just trying to understand, I know you have the new stores in there but aside from that, you talk about normal replacement of existing capital assets, manufacturing-related equipment. Any more details you can provide on that piece of the CapEx that is being spent on the capital assets? In particular, what that is and when that should start to decrease as a percentage of sales?",1
"Iâm not sure I would look at it as a percent of sales but in fiscal 09, our CapEx was about $1.15 billion, up from about $1.1 billion last year. We spent a little under $400 million in both years on retail stores. As I look forward, we are going to continue to confidently open retail stores and keep them fresh and exciting from a remodel perspective.",1
"The other parts of our business, we are spending capital on the facilities, infrastructure, and in the manufacturing spaces as well. But in $1.1 billion in the last two years, weâve not been terribly capital intensive.",1
"Thanks, Maynard. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"From Deutsche Bank, weâll hear from Chris Whitemore.",1
"The air freight is not related to the iPhone so these are unrelated topics. But, generally speaking the air freight is planned to get enough units into the channel in time for the holidays and is necessary for that reason.",1
"Then on the availability issues that you had on the phone, was that a good old fashion demand exceeds supply issue or were there any component availability issues that constrained your supply? Related to that you had also mentioned that air freight you expected to go up next quarter as a reason for gross margins, Iâm not sure if that was in relation to phones or anything else but perhaps you can address that as well?",1
"First, for some key components costs are rising. I think that is visible to you. Second, we are continuing to focus on delivering state of the art products at price points our competitors canât match and we are going to continue to provide ever increasing value to our customers.",1
Could you give us any sort of sense qualitatively in terms of what Apple has seen with respect to the impact of the remodeled stores as well as the increasing penetration of the Apple Retail stores internationally? Are you seeing any sort of synergies both with your direct or indirect sales levels because of these initiatives or is it still too early to be determined?,1
"On the iPhone with the wholesale price for the iPhone the same whether you have an exclusive agreement or whether you have multiple carriers, what are the benefits of having exclusive agreements in some of those bigger countries?",1
For Apple or for the carrier?,1
For Apple.,1
"In an exclusive relationship you can generally have some level of innovation that would be more difficult to do with several carriers. Digital voicemail was an example of that we had in the initial iPhone,as you recall.",1
"Also in some cases an exclusive carrier may be willing to invest more, lthough we found no lack of people wanting to sell iPhones,frankly. So I am not sure whether that is true on a broad basis or not. I think that may be true in some individual cases.",1
"Other than that, I would ask them because they can probably give you a better view than I could.",1
"I will take that question. We are seeing strong results from our remodeled stores. Lon and his team have remodeled, as I said, this year 72 of the stores to bring them to our most updated design. Those designs are providing the best customer experience in the industry, bar none, whether it be upfront in the selling part of the store or certainly in the back of the store with the genius bars or the creative bars. Customers are having a great experience.",1
"On a sequential basis yes, our ASPs were up a bit in the portable space. This was really a function of our seeing a higher mix of our new Mac Book Pros as Tim commented. A very, very strong quarter after the June introduction. We had the best back-to-school season that we have ever had. On a sequential basis we also got a little benefit from the dollar as well. On a year-over-year basis the dollar was a negative but sequentially it was a small positive.",1
"In terms of international, the growth there was quite strong in the quarter. Our average store revenue was actually up over 20% for our international stores this quarter.",1
The other question revolves around the OpEx ratio going forward. You talked in your prepared remarks about 2010 and the new product pipeline. Can you give us a sense in terms of how investors should think about the R&D or SG&A moving up? Is that going to hold steady or will there be changes regarding that pipeline?,1
"I donât want to give a specific, quantitative percent. I think over the last year we have managed operating expenses well but we have been investing confidently for our future especially in engineering, distribution and our marketing and advertising. We saw the benefit in the last downturn in 2001 and 2002 of coming out of that with just an amazingly strong pipeline and we are repeating that very positive lesson this time around. So I think we are being careful with money. We are making good choices but continuing to invest wisely and confidently in our future.",1
You had very strong ASP performance in both Mac and iPhone. On the Mac side you are typically down because of the back-to-school promotion because of ASP. You were up even on the Notebook side this quarter. Can you comment on that?,1
On the iPhone side it does look like your ASP went up $40 or $50 sequentially on a cash basis. You had stated last quarter that 3GS was outstripping the $99 phone so was it mix alone or was there something else around currency translation or something else that is affecting that?,1
Let me start with iPhone. The iPhone ASP in the quarter was just over $600 and this reflected both a high mix of the 3GS sell through and also the benefit of the rebalancing the ending channel inventory more towards the 3GS as a result of the introduction.,1
"As you know, as weâve shipped the 3G and the 2G phone prior to that, we discovered that there were quite a few phones going in to China so it would seem to us to indicate that thereâs a good opportunity and weâre really excited to get started. Weâre not making any projections on the volume but it is a huge market, the largest market in the world in terms of total phones and I think itâs very important that we get started to make it as large as possible on Smartphones.",1
"I know you donât want to quantify China, maybe, but is there any certain level of excitement you have or any limitations in terms of apps and iTunes that may limit the sales out of the gate or anything else you could say qualitatively around that launch that would give us an idea of the velocity of units?",1
"The things that we are considering -- we donât give Mac-specific forecasts, as you know, or product specific forecasts -- but the things I think you should consider that we considered, anyway, in coming up with our numbers, the September quarter was benefited by a 50,000 unit order from the State of Maine. This completed the 70,000 unit order. The other 20,000 had shipped in our fiscal Q3.",1
"Sales of iPod Touch grew strongly during the quarter, up 100% year over year, fueled by a very successful back-to-school season and the continued incredible popularity of the Apps store. With the new $199 entry price point for the iPod Touch and the updated features of the iPod Shuffle, Nano, and Classic, we believe the iPodâs lineup is attractively positioned for the holiday season.",1
We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide added transparency to our business and hope they are helpful to you in your analysis and understanding of our performance in the September quarter.,1
"Turning to the details of our results, Iâd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We generated outstanding Mac sales of 3.05 million, beating our previous record set in the year-ago quarter by over 440,000. The Mac is showing fantastic momentum, growing faster than the market in 19 of the past 20 quarters. We believe this is the result of our unmatched innovation and commitment to providing customers with the best hardware, the best software, and the best user experience in the world.",1
Quarterly Mac sales grew 17% year over year and this compares extremely favorably to IDCâs latest published estimate of 2% growth for the market overall in the September quarter. Customers continue to respond very positively to our Mac portable lineup which we updated in June. Portable sales increased 35% year over year and represented 74% of our Mac mix.,1
"Our execution in the quarter was outstanding and we were particularly pleased with the 42% year over year growth in our Asia-Pacific segment. We once again had a very successful back-to-school season and we are very pleased with a 12% year-over-year increase in Mac sales to U.S. education institutions, which resulted in the highest quarterly Mac sales ever for our U.S. education business. The shipments to U.S. education institutions this quarter included 50,000 Macbooks to the State of Maine as part of its ongoing one-to-one initiative.",1
"Customer response to the August 28th release of Snow Leopard has been tremendous. Through the end of the September quarter, we generated consumer box upgrade sales at twice the rate we experienced with the Leopard release. Snow Leopard delivers hundreds of refinements, is the only operating system to support Exchange out-of-the-box, and has successfully introduced new core technologies. Snow Leopard allows developers to take full advantage of hardware features, including 64-bit technologies, multi-core processors, and advanced graphics processing units.",1
"Now Iâll turn to our music products. We sold almost 10.2 million iPods, which was down from just over 11 million in the year-ago quarter. Our latest research indicates that 50% of recent iPod buyers were purchasing their first iPod, including those in our high market share countries such as the U.S., Japan, Australia, Canada, and the U.K. Customers love the recently announced iPod Nanoâs new features, including the built-in videocamera, FM radio, pedometer, and larger display.",1
"Our share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD, and iPod was the top-selling MP3 player and continued to gain share year over year in nearly every country we track, based on the latest data published by GFK.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $9.87 billion, representing 25% growth over the prior September quarterâs results. This was Apple's second-highest quarterly revenue ever, next to the record results reported for the last September quarter. Operating margin was Apple's highest ever at $2.19 billion, representing over 22% of revenue and higher than our guidance due to better-than-expected revenue and gross margin. Net income was $1.67 billion, which translated to earnings per share of $1.82.",1
"The iTunes store delivered another great quarter with strong sales of music, video, and apps. Customers are loving last monthâs release of iTunes 9 and its many new features, including iTunes LT, home-sharing, and genius mixes, as well as improved thinking and the redesigned iTunes store.",1
"With stores in 23 countries, iTunes is the worldâs largest music retailer, now offering over 11 million songs in addition to over 50,000 TV episodes and 7,500 films.",1
I would now like to turn to the iPhone. We are thrilled to have sold almost 7.4 million handsets in the September quarter. Thatâs a new company record and an increase of 7% over the prior September quarter when we increased channel inventory by 2 million handsets following the introduction of the iPhone 3G and the dramatic expansion of geographic distribution. iPhone sell-through in the quarter increased 38% year over year.,1
"Response to the new iPhone 3GS has continued to be tremendous and we were very pleased with JD Power & Associatesâ announcement earlier this month that iPhone has once again topped the charts for both consumer and business smartphone customer satisfaction. iPhone not only maintained its lead since the last JD Power report was issued six months ago, but it widened it over the next closest competitor in both categories.",1
We are looking forward to selling iPhones in China beginning later this month as this very large market represents a great opportunity to expand iPhone's reach even more broadly. We also plan to expand our carrier relationships in the U.K. and Canada.,1
"The Apps store continues to be an unparalleled success, with over 85,000 apps available and over 2 billion customer downloads to date, including over half a billion downloads in the September quarter. In addition to adding more apps at an amazing pace, we have continue to enhance the Apps Store experience with iPhone OS 3.1 which includes new features such as genius recommendations and a streamlined way to organize apps within iTunes.",1
"In terms of non-GAAP measures, adjusted sales totaled $12.25 billion for the September quarter, which was almost $2.4 billion higher than our reported revenue. Adjusted gross margin was $5.21 billion, which was almost $1.6 billion higher than our reported gross margin. And adjusted net income was $2.85 billion, or almost $1.2 billion higher than our reported net income.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased to report Appleâs most profitable quarter ever, and sales of more Macs and iPhones than in any previous quarter. We are thrilled with these record-breaking results, particularly given the economic environment around us.",1
"I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. The stores had a record quarter posting the highest revenue, segment margin and Mac sales ever. Revenue in the quarter was $1.87 billion compared to $1.72 billion in the year-ago quarter. Our stores sold 670,000 Macs compared to 596,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the September quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.",1
"And I think earlier, thereâs been lots of discussion about limited visibility on whether thereâs delays to purchases or the economy. When do you think you get better visibility to things like Mac upgrade or uptake cycles versus economy related headwinds or changes in buyer patterns here, given so much uncertainty? Is that first quarter next year and is your price point comment about we are going to restrict ourselves to certain markets we want to play in, is that firm or are there alternative strategies you might employ if you donât get the upgrade cycles, or response to the price point stance that you are looking for?",1
We are obviously making bets on the demand already and -- so we are predicting. Itâs just hard for us to forecast for external consumption.,1
"Okay. Thanks for the details, folks.",1
"Thank you, Bill. Could we have the next question, please?",1
Your next question will come from Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.,1
"Thanks very much. Steve, you only have really one SKU in the phone biz, and the phone market is 10 times the size of the PC market, so I think you clearly as you said strive to be the best. At the same time, what might be the opportunities for further innovation or market opportunities within that market?",1
"Well, I wasnât alive then but from everything I heard, Babe Ruth had only one homerun, he just kept hitting it over and over again. So I donât think that -- I think the traditional game in the phone market has been to produce a voice phone in a hundred different varieties. But as software starts to become the differentiating technology of this product category, I think that people are going to find that a hundred variations presented to a software developer is not very enticing and most of the competitors in this phone business do not really have much experience in a software platform business. So we are extremely comfortable with our strategy, our product strategy going forward and we approach it as a software platform company, which is pretty different than most of our competitors.",1
"Mike, I think the answer to your question is different by product. On iPod, historically about half of our sell-through occurs in December and so the question of iPod visibility, weâll get a lot better visibility as we head into December on this quarter. Before then, the visibility will be limited.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2008, the Forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release.",1
"In the Mac area, the question is how much was purchasing delay versus economy, if at all, and weâll gain knowledge on that each week but it will take some number of weeks before we are able to meet the demand in that space, and so I think it will take a little while longer.",1
"Thank you, Mike. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820, and the confirmation code is 5643095, and these replays will be available beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.",1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896, and financial analysts can contact either Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570 and I am at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
"Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude todayâs presentation. We thank everyone for your participation and have a wonderful day.",1
"Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this Apple Incorporated fourth quarter fiscal year 2009 earnings release conference call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Madam.",1
"Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenues, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share, and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts.",1
"Recognized revenue from the iPhone handset sales, accessory sales and carrier payments was $2.3 billion during the quarter compared to $806 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 185%. The sales value of iPhones sold during the quarter was $4.5 billion.",1
"We opened 15 new stores during the quarter, bringing us to a total of 273. With an average of 262 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $7.1 million compared to $7.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment margin was $410 million or 22%, up from $301 million or 17.5% in the year-ago quarter.",1
"I would have liked to have had more, honestly, because we were still short in some countries at quarter end. As I indicated, it was early October before we were able to get supply and demand balanced in some countries.",1
"And fourth, we expect component costs to be higher than what we saw in the September quarter.",1
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.,1
"Peter, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the factors in forming your guidance for the following quarter. Specifically, why the sequential jump in revenue is so far below what you have experienced for the last couple of years and also why gross margins should be down as much as you've got it sequentially, the main factors there?",1
"Let me start with gross margin and I will come back to revenue. We expect gross margins to decline sequentially about 34%, primarily as a result of four factors:",1
"First, for the new products that we have and will announce, we are delivering greater value to our customers and these products have lower gross margins than their predecessors.",1
"Second and as expected, we will see a seasonally higher mix of iPods and expect Snow Leopard box sales to be less than the second quarter.",1
"Third, we will incur significantly more air freight.",1
"Regarding our revenue, as you know, the education and back-to-school seasons have largely concluded and the December quarter has been typically driven by holiday purchases in the second half of the quarter. Our guidance this quarter includes double-digit revenue growth from last year, which was the best quarter from a revenue perspective in Apple's history.",1
As we begin our fiscal 2010 we are looking forward to delivering additional exciting new products and are confident in our new product pipeline. We remain focused on our strategy of bringing the best and most innovative products and solutions to our customers and we are very enthusiastic about the year ahead.,1
"We are also seeing lower ASPs this year. But Rich, we remain very confident in our business. We are shipping the best products that we ever have in Appleâs history and customers have clearly responded.",1
Your next question comes from Benjamin Reitzes â Barclays Capital.,1
"I have two questions. One on iPhone, can you discuss channel inventory, what it was ending the quarter and what the supply situation is, if there are any supply constraints during the quarter? We noticed lack of availability overseas and then that looked alleviated towards the end of the quarter. It would seem like there is pent up demand heading in to December, so if you could discuss that, that would be great.",1
"For much of the quarter most of the countries where we are selling the iPhone 3GS was very low in inventory, as demand outstripped the supply. We did improve supply markedly in September and supply and demand converged in the vast majority of countries either in September or in early October.",1
"In terms of your channel inventory question, we now have about 2.4 million units in the channel and thatâs an additional 585,000 from the previous quarter end.",1
"Are you comfortable with that, given that you have China launching and maybe even a few other geos?",1
Question & Answer Session,1
"During the year, we continued to introduce incredibly innovative products, including the new aluminum unibody MacBook Pro, the iPhone 3GS, and the iPhone OS 3.0, Mac OS10 Snow Leopard, and of course, the wildly popular new features and offerings in iTunes and the Apps Store.",1
"We hosted 45.9 million visitors in our stores during the quarter, compared to 42.7 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 7%. We hosted 608,000 personal training sessions and we sold 208,000 memberships to our One-to-One program, an increase of over 120% year-over-year.",1
"Our investment priority for the cash continues to be preservation of capital which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short-dated, high quality investments and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio.",1
"Fiscal 2009 was a milestone year for our retail stores. In addition to opening 26 new stores we remodeled 72 stores to our updated design and for the first time we opened more stores internationally than in the United States. In November we plan to open our first new stores in France, including one at the Louvre as well as our fourth high-profile store in Manhattan on the Upper West Side.",1
Total company gross margin was 36.6% which was 260 basis points better than our guidance. There were two groups of factors that were the primary causes of this difference:,1
"First, we sold more Snow Leopards, had a better product mix and spent less on the iPod transition than planned.",1
"Second, component costs did increase, but not to the level we had expected and we benefited from leverage on the higher revenue and lower freight and other costs than planned.",1
Operating expenses were $1.42 billion and included $151 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $45 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26%.,1
"Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $34 billion at the end of the September quarter compared to $31.1 billion at the end of the June quarter, an increase of $2.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $3.1 billion and that was net of our $500 million prepayment to Toshiba early in the September quarter to secure a future supply of NAND flash.",1
"Looking ahead to the December quarter, I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"In closing, we are thrilled with our outstanding September quarter results and with our record fiscal 2009. For the year, we generated $36.5 billion in revenue and $5.7 billion in net income. That is 12% annual revenue growth and 18% net income growth in extraordinarily challenging economic times.",1
"On September 23, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ratified EITF 093, which will change the way we account for iPhones and Apple TV today. Under EITF 093, only the estimated sales value of future upgrade rights to iPhones and Apple TV software are required to be deferred at the time of sale, with the balance of the iPhones and Apple TV sales price being recognized immediately as revenue. The deferred amount will be recognized over the 24 months estimated life of the product, similar to the way we have applied subscription accounting to these product sales today.",1
"We donât know at this time the specific amount of revenue deferral for each iPhone and Apple TV sold under EITF 093, but we do believe that a substantial portion of the revenues will be recognized for these products at the time of sale. We are very pleased with the FASB adoption of this new rule, as we believe it will enable us to more closely align our reported results with the economics of the iPhone and Apple TV sales.",1
"We will be required to adopt the new accounting rules no later than the first quarter of our fiscal 2011; a year from now. But we do have the option of adopting earlier than that, sometime in our fiscal 2010. We are currently assessing the impact of the new rule on our accounting and reporting systems and processes. Making this change will be complex and as of now, we are uncertain as to the timing of our adoption; therefore, we don't have anything more specific to discuss with you today about this change.",1
"The guidance for the December quarter that we are providing today is based on a subscription accounting treatment that we have applied today for the iPhone and Apple TV sales. In other words, it is based on the assumption that the full amounts of revenue and product costs of past and future iPhone and Apple TV sales continue to be recognized ratably over the estimated 24-month life of the product.",1
Forecasts in the current economic macro environment remains challenging but we will continue to provide a range of guidance for the December quarter.,1
"For the December quarter, we expect the revenues to be between about $11.3 billion and $11.6 billion. We expect gross margin to be about 34%, reflecting approximately $33 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $1.64 billion, including about $178 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $30 million, reflective of the short-term interest rate environment, and we expect the tax rate to be about 30%. We are targeting EPS in the range of about $1.70 to $1.78.",1
"First on the Mac business, looking forward to the December quarter, do you expect to hold Mac units roughly flat sequentially?",1
"It also benefited from an extremely strong back-to-school season and we had an extremely strong promotion wrapped around that, as you are aware. We also had Snow Leopard and with every new OS, you have some pent-up demand that ships with the operating systems as people hold to get the latest software.",1
And that will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.,1
"I'm sorry, Rich, for the September quarter?",1
"These are among the reasons we think the current crop of seven-inch tablets are going to be DOA, Dead on Arrival. Their manufacturers will learn the painful lesson that their tablets are too small and increase the size next year, thereby abandoning both customers and developers who jumped on the seven-inch bandwagon with an orphan product. Sounds like lots of fun ahead.",1
"So thank you, and let me turn it back to Peter for the Q&A session.",1
(Operator Instructions) And your first question will come from Richard Gardner with Citi.,1
"I had two quick ones, if I could. One is the supply constraints on iPad. Could you talk about how severe the supply constraints are on that product and how quickly you expect it to improve? And then a follow-up for Peter on gross margin please.",1
"Relative to iPad supply/demand, weâve got into a balanced situation in September with the limited number of distribution points in the 26 countries where we sold the iPad. And so we exited the quarter in a supply position that allows us to expand distribution prior to the holidays as we've planned for sometime. And hopefully you've seen some of the recent announcements of added partners in the United States. We're also expanding internationally, and will be launching additional countries as the quarter goes on.",1
"And then Peter, you mentioned several sequential tailwinds for gross margin during the September quarter. Could you talk about the headwinds in the quarter and what impact they had on gross margin sequentially, please?",1
"For the September quarter, yes.",1
"Fifth, iPad now has over 35,000 apps on the App Store. This new crop of tablets will have near zero.",1
"In our last conference call, we talked about several things that we thought would cause margins to come down some. And all those things did play out, but margins came down actually about half of what we thought that they would. And we did a bit better in the quarter because commodity and other costs were better than we thought, and we sold more iPhones than we had planned to.",1
"From Piper Jaffray, we have Gene Munster.",1
"If you can talk a little bit about the iPad opportunity you went through, and gave us some good insight in terms of the competitive landscape. But as analysts, we're here kind of trying to put some estimates out there and we're not doing a great job of trying to figure out this trajectory in the iPad.",1
"Can you help us understand how you think about the business a year or two years down the road in terms of size of your overall business, impact on enterprise, education, anything you can give to help us on that front? And then a follow-up question.",1
"Well, the iPad is clearly going to affect notebook computers. And I think the iPad proves, it's not a question of if, it's a question of when. And I think a lot of development and progress that will occur over the next few years. But we're already seeing tremendous interest in iPad from education, and much to my surprise, from business.",1
"We haven't pushed it real hard in business, and it's being grabbed out of our hands. And I talk to people everyday in all kinds of businesses that are using iPads, all the way from Boards of Directors that are shipping iPads around instead of board books, down to nurses and doctors in hospitals and other large and small businesses.",1
"And sixth and last, our potential competitors are having a tough time coming close to iPad's pricing, even with their far smaller, far less expensive screens. The iPad incorporates everything we have learnt about building high value products from iPhones, iPods and Macs. We create our own A4 chip, our own software, our own battery chemistry, our own enclosure, our own everything. And this results in an incredible product at a great price. The proof of this will be in the pricing of our competitor's products which will likely offer less for more.",1
"Fourth, almost all of these new tablets use Android software, but even Google is telling the tablet manufacturers not to use their current release, Froyo, for tablets, and to wait for a special tablet release next year. What does it mean when your software suppliers does not (inaudible) to use their software in your tablet? And what does it mean when you ignore them and use it anyway?",1
"So, I see it as very general purpose, and I see it as really big. And the timing, one could argue about the timing endlessly, but I don't think one could argue that it's going to happen anymore.",1
"In addition to Google's own app marketplace, Amazon, Verizon and Vodafone have all announced that they are creating their own app stores for Android. So there will be at least four app stores on Android, which customers must search among to find the app they want and developers will need to work with to distribute their apps and get paid. This is going to be a mess for both users and developers. Contrast this with Apple's integrated App Store, which offers users the easiest-to-use largest app store in the world, preloaded on every iPhone. Apple's App Store has over three times as many apps as Google's marketplace and offers developers' one-stop shopping to get their apps to market easily and to get paid swiftly.",1
"First, let me discuss iPhone. We sold 14.1 million iPhones in the quarter which represents a 91% unit growth over the year-ago quarter and was well ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 64% growth for the global smartphone market in the September quarter. And it handily beat RIM's 12.1 million Blackberry's sold in their most recent quarter ending in August. We've now passed RIM, and I don't seem them catching up with us in the foreseeable future. They must move beyond their area of strength and comfort into the unfamiliar territory of trying to become a software platform company.",1
"I think it's going to be a challenge for them to create a competitive platform and to convince developers to create apps for yet a third software platform after iOS and Android. With 300,000 apps on Apple's App Store, RIM has a high mountain ahead of them to climb.",1
"Well, what about Google? Last week, Eric Schmidt reiterated that they are activating 200,000 Android devices per day. And have around 90,000 apps in their App Store. For comparison, Apple has activated around 275,000 iOS devices per day on average for the past 30 days with a peak of almost 300,000 iOS devices per day on a few of those days. And Apple has 300,000 apps on its App Store.",1
"Unfortunately, there is no solid data on how many Android phones are shipped each quarter. We hope that manufacturers will soon start reporting the number of Android handsets they ship each quarter. But today that just isn't the case. Gartner reported that around 10 million Android phones were shipped in the June quarter and we await to see if iPhone or Android was the winner in this most recent quarter.",1
"Google loves to characterize Android as open, and iOS and iPhone as closed. We find this a bit disingenuous and clouding the real difference between our two approaches. The first thing most of us think about when we hear the work open is Windows which is available on a variety of devices. Unlike Windows, however, where most pc's have the same user interface and run the same app, Android is very fragmented. Many Android OEMs, including the two largest, HTC and Motorola install proprietary user interfaces to differentiate themselves from the commodity Android experience. The users will have to figure it all out. Compare this with iPhone, where every handset works the same.",1
"Twitter client, Twitter Deck, recently launched their app for Android. They reported that they had to contend with more than 100 different versions of Android software on 244 different handsets. The multiple hardware and software iterations present developers with a daunting challenge. Many Android apps work only on selected Android handsets running selected Android versions. And this is for handsets that have been shipped less than 12 months ago. Compare this with iPhone, where there are two versions of the software, the current and the most recent predecessor to test against.",1
"Even if Google were right, and the real issue is closed versus open, it is worthwhile to remember that open systems don't always win. Take Microsoft's PlaysForSure music strategy, which use the PC model, which Android uses as well, of separating the software components from the hardware components. Even Microsoft finally abandoned this open strategy in favor of copying Apple's integrated approach with their Zoom Player, unfortunately leaving their OEMs empty-handed in the process. Google flirted with this integrated approach with their Nexus One phone.",1
"Third, every tablet user is also a smartphone user. No tablet can compete with the mobility of a smartphone, its ease of fitting into your pocket or purse, its unobtrusiveness when used in a crowd. Given that all tablet users will already have a smartphone in their pockets, giving up precious display area to fit a tablet in our pockets is clearly the wrong tradeoff. The seven-inch tablets are tweeners, too big to compete with a smartphone and too small to compete with an iPad.",1
"In reality, we think the open versus closed argument is just a smokescreen to try and hide the real issue, which is, what's best for the customer, fragmented versus integrated. We think Android is very, very fragmented and becoming more fragmented by the day. And as you know, Apple's strives for the integrated model so that the user isn't forced to be the systems integrator.",1
"We see tremendous value in having Apple rather than our users' be the systems integrator. We think this is a huge strength of our approach compared to Google's. When selling to users who want their devices to just work, we believe integrated will trump fragmented every time. And we also think our developers can be more innovative if they can target a singular platform rather than a hundred variants. They can put their time into innovative new features rather than testing on hundreds of different handsets.",1
"So we are very committed to the integrated approach, no matter how many times Google tries to characterize it as closed. And we are confident that it will triumph over Google's fragmented approach, no matter how many times Google tries to characterize it as open.",1
"Second, I'd like to comment on the avalanche of tablets poised to enter the market in the coming months. First, it appears to be just a handful of credible entrants, not exactly an avalanche. Second, almost all of them use seven-inch screens as compared to iPad's near 10-inch screen. Let's start there. One naturally thinks that a seven-inch screen would offer 70% of the benefits of a 10-inch screen. Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. The screen measurements are diagonal, so that a seven-inch screen is only 45% as large as iPad's 10-inch screen. You heard me right; just 45% as large",1
"If you take an iPad and hold it upright in portrait view and draw an imaginary horizontal line halfway down the screen, the screens on the seven-inch tablets are a bit smaller than the bottom half of the iPad display. This size isn't sufficient to create great tablet apps in our opinion.",1
"Well, one could increase the resolution of the display to make up for some of the difference. It is meaningless, unless your tablet also includes sandpaper, so that the user can sand down their fingers to around one quarter of the present size. Apple's done extensive user-testing on touch interfaces over many years, and we really understand this stuff. There are clear limits of how close you can physically place elements on a touch screen before users cannot reliably tap, flick or pinch them. This is one of the key reasons we think the 10-inch screen size is the minimum size required to create great tablet apps.",1
"So the more time that passes, the more I am convinced that we've got a tiger by the tail here. And this is a new model of computing which we've already got tens of millions of people trained on with the iPhone. And that lends itself to lots of different aspects of life both personal, educational and business.",1
Do you think this could be your second-biggest business in iPhone?,1
"And we remain extremely confident in our new product pipeline. Before taking your questions, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Jobs.",1
You mean in the September quarter?,1
"Well, we don't talk about unannounced products, but I'm happy to tell you what I know about Apple TV. We have gone to streaming model on Apple TV; it's complete streaming. So all the content is rented from the iTunes store or is streamed from your computer, or soon to be streamed from your iPhone or iPad with AirPlay. And so how is our new model of Apple TV doing? Well, I can report that in just a very short amount of time we've already sold a quarter million of them, over 250,000, and we're thrilled with that.",1
"I think that it's a great product and I think its $99 price point is very enticing. And I think when we get the AirPlay stuff in place before the end of this year, it's going to give another big reason for people to buy it. So we're really happy with how it's turned out.",1
The next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley,1
"First, for Peter, how much of the sequential decline in gross margin related to the iPhone in the September quarter and particularly the bumper program?",1
"Katy, we've recorded a revenue deferral of just over $100 million in the September quarter for the bumper program. We would expect to record that in revenue in the December quarter. We did ship a number of bumpers in the September quarter, and that is reflected in our gross margin, as is the number that we expect to ship in the December quarter. That's reflected in our guidance as well.",1
"And just to be clear, is the iPhone the product segment that dropped the most sequentially as it relates to gross margins? I guess people are just asking what drove the sequential down tick which we haven't seen for some time.",1
"Yes, in the September quarter.",1
"Ben, in providing our guidance we thought about each of those factors that you cited, and we do see a small sequential decline. This has been primarily driven by a higher than expected mix of new iPod's that we just recently announced, and more iPad sales, and which as Steve said, we've been very aggressive with our pricing and are delivering great value to customers. So it's the higher mix of those on a sequential basis that I see impacting the gross margin slightly.",1
"Well again, this was not a surprise to us. And we, on our last conference call highlighted that we would have a higher mix of iPhone 4 sales, and we were very aggressive with feature function there. So it had a different gross margin than its predecessor product. We also sold more iPads. Again, we were very aggressive there with our pricing. And we had the bumper program and some one-time items that occurred in June that we said wouldn't occur in September.",1
"So these were sort of the factors we saw bringing down gross margin. To some extent, each of them did occur in the September quarter, but we ended up doing about 50% better than we thought as a result of the commodity market and selling more iPhones.",1
"And then Steve, just as a follow-up. It seems like you fundamentally believe that Apple should be able to out-ship Android if you add up all the mobile devices over time. What are the key risks you're managing the company to make sure you don't lose that lead, whether it's distribution, or pricing, or features? What do you think the biggest risks are that you need to watch carefully?",1
"Well, our goal is to make the best devices in the world. It's not to be the biggest; as you know, Nokia is the biggest. And we admire them for being able to ship the number of handsets that they do. But we don't aspire to be like them. They are good at being like them. We want to be like us, and we want to make the best ones.",1
"So in our part of the market, Android is our biggest competitor. They out-shipped us in the June quarter as we were transitioning to iPhone 4. They out-shipped us for the first time according to Gartner's numbers, which we think are pretty accurate. And so we're waiting to find out what happened in this quarter. We'll find out. I don't know how we'll find out, but Gartner will put out some new numbers, and maybe others will, so one of these days we'll eventually learn.",1
"And I imagine we'll be competing with them for quite some time. But we have very different approaches. And we believe in our approach very strongly is providing users products that just work. And we think there is lots of users that want that in the world, and their approach is very different than that. And there maybe lots of users that want that their approach as well. But we're going to pursue ours and we think that's the winning approach in the end.",1
"Okay. And then Steve, can you just comment on how your hobby is doing, Apple TV? You took the hard drive out of there, and it seems like Apple is moving more to a streaming model work, you know, potentially a lot of other things, and I was just wondering what your thoughts were for the Apple TV, maybe that kind of business model proliferating into more products. But I was wondering how Apple TV is doing and what's your thoughts going forward?",1
"First, for Peter, can you just talk a little bit about gross margins? You have gross margin guidance of 36. With component prices still favorable and probably more iPhone's being sold sequentially, can you just talk about why margins would go down sequentially, which seems also that you released the revenue on the bumper program? And then I have a follow-up for Steve, if you don't mind.",1
"I try to not predict, I try to just report. So, we'll keep you posted. As you know, we're already shipping more of them than Macs after just a few quarters.",1
"From RBC Capital Markets, we'll go to Mike Abramsky.",1
"On the Flash side, any updates on your stance on Flash?",1
Flash memory; we love Flash memory.,1
"Peter, just one quick question. Our tracks were that you had about three weeks lead-time in most of your countries on the iPhone throughout the quarter. You mentioned you could have sold more iPhones. How do you think about what the true demand could have been in the quarter?",1
"I think that which you're referring to is the quote that's on the Apple Online Store. What I would say is that the demand in all countries is absolutely staggering. And at this point I can't predict when supply will meet demand. I feel great about our ability to move the supply and the sales up from an 8 million kind of number to over 14 million. But it's clear, last quarter that wasn't enough. And we are obviously working on that, but it will take some time to increase further.",1
"Were you more supply-constrained in the September quarter versus the June quarter? Totally different dynamics in the quarter, but any perspective on the two quarters?",1
"It's clear that the iPhone 4 and the announcement of iPhone 4 and the demand for it took the demand to an entirely different level. And we had anticipated a very different level, but it's even higher than that.",1
"Steve, appreciate your commentary. You know, you are the tablet market right now. And this is I think the second time now you've come on to talk about or certainly at one time during your presentation to talk about competition. And I am just wondering, if much like Apple encroaching on whims, monopoly and enterprise, if you think that Apple's going to able to sustain share growth for tablets amid some of those new competitive headwinds?",1
It's Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays Capital.,1
"Some of those players may try different things and strategies like tethering and Flash, multi-tasking, less content and app restrictions and subsidized pricing. And just wondered if you think that, that may create itself a more fragmented market and how you see that rolling out with regard to Apple?",1
"I have a hard time envisioning what those strategies you mentioned are. I mean, in terms of pricing, so far, the little we've seen, the tablets with far less functionality are having a hard time matching us in price. Flash hasn't presented any problem at all. As you know, most of the video on the web is now available in HTML 5. And having the iTunes media store and over 35,000 apps on the App Store for iPad dwarfs anything else. And we think we have a very good product here that's going to be hard to match, and we're not done. We're working on a lot of things for the future.",1
So I don't know exactly what these strategies are. And we've priced iPad pretty aggressively. So we're out to win this one.,1
"And just lastly, the smartphones, do you see that as a zero sum game?",1
"Well, as you know the largest market of phones today around the world are non smartphones. And so over the next several years, many of those non-smartphones are going to convert to smartphones. And the pie is going to continue to grow, and I think there will be room for some number of companies to be successful. But eventually, as most of those phones do convert to smartphones, it will turn into a zero sum game or at least a lot closer to that.",1
But I think right now it's a battle for developers and a battle for the mindshare of developers and a battle for the mindshare of customers. And right now iPhone and Android are winning that battle.,1
"As most of you know, I don't usually participate in Apple's earnings calls since you are all in such capable hands with Peter and Tim. But I just couldn't help dropping by for our first $20 billion quarter. I would like to chat about a few things and then stay for the rest of the Q&A if that's alright.",1
"We expect OI&E to be about $65 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. We're targeting EPS of about $4.80. In closing, we're thrilled with our record September quarter and fiscal year 2010 results. We're very enthusiastic about our innovative product line-up and our significant opportunities for growth as we head into fiscal 2011.",1
"Finally, and I wouldnât underestimate this, the demand for the portables that we announced in June was a key for the quarter at 35% growth and some of that was demand that was probably existed in June but we were unable to fill. So it got the quarter off to a very good start.",1
That 5% is a worldwide number.,1
These numbers are very impressive to us and we feel like we are making great progress in this market.,1
"And Tim, I think that you commented in the past that three of that Fortune 100 had 25,000 units or greater. Any updates on there?",1
"None that we can provide. As you can probably guess, many of these companies would like to keep their specific numbers confidential.",1
"Understood. And final question, any chance that the international activations grew on a year-over-year basis for the iPhone?",1
"Well, iPhone sell-through was up 38% year-over-year. You know, as Peter went through in the preamble last year, and I think it's very important to remember, we expanded channel inventory by about 2 million units because it was the launch of the iPhone 3G, during that quarter. We only grew inventory this particular year by less than 600,000 and so that sell through increase of 38% compares to a projected rate of market growth of 5% from analysis. So it is a significant multiple to market growth based on the market statistics that we have.",1
"That 5%, just to clarify, is international?",1
"I have a question for you on the Macintosh side if I could to do a deeper dive on the education sector. A question for Tim, you have been pretty cautious regarding state spending here given the tax issues that you quoted for the different states. What powered the upside in education, specifically K12 and higher ed? Also if you could give additional color on what happened in the student buy versus your expectations as well given the popularity of Notebooks for students. Then I have one follow-up if I could.",1
And the same with regard to corporate entities as well?,1
"Let me start with the last one first. The student buy, you can see those numbers trickling through our retail results and you canât see this because we donât quite break it out separately but they significantly helped our online results and the institutions that buy through bookstores so that the back-to-school season again was our strongest ever and I would attribute a great piece of that to the individual business we were talking about. In terms of the institutional business, I have been worried about state spending. I am still worried about state spending. We saw no material stimulus funding slowing last quarter. We saw a little but it was a very small number. We may see more this quarter but it is too early to tell.",1
"In terms of the institutional increase, institutions grew about 12% and that increase was the big thing that pushed us over the zero mark there, the state of Maine order. It was extremely key in the education institution achievement.",1
"On Mac inventory, doing a deeper dive here on the air freight question, I know you wonât talk about the products but what is driving the increase in air freight? Is it timing of new announcements? Are you having issues with component availability? Are you running into manufacturing yield issues? Why the uptick here?",1
What is driving the air freight is we havenât been able to figure out a way to move the holiday season. We have to get all of these units into the channel for holiday sales. Iâm sorry I canât be more specific than that. You have to have a little bit of fun on these calls.,1
"That concludes our Q&A session for today. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks as podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on Apple.com/Investor and via telephone. The numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. The confirmation code is 1248587. These replays will be available beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. PT today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896 and financial analysts can contact John or met with additional questions. John is at 408-974-4570 and I am at 408-974-5420.",1
"Good day everyone and welcome to this Apple Incorporated fourth quarter fiscal year 2010 earnings release. (Operator Instructions) At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations.",1
"Yes, and I just went through that in the previous call, but to repeat it, well over 50% of the Fortune 100 are deploying or piloting the iPhone, and this strength is also happening internationally and if you take Europe, about 50% of the Financial Times 100 are deploying or actively evaluating iPhones for a broad deployment.",1
No new update on specific numbers but we continue to be very pleased with the market and the number of agencies that are adopting the iPhone.,1
"For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2009, as amended, the Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2010 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speaks as of their respective dates.",1
I have provided you the guidance that we have provided. It's very detailed and consistent with when we began to ship the iPhone. We provide guidance on GAAP and we will report to you our numbers in January for the December quarter.,1
So those are the things that we thought about as we forecasted the Mac business.,1
"Second question on iPhone supply. Can you quantify the magnitude of the unit shortfall? In other words, what do you think you could have shipped had you had adequate supply during the quarter?",1
"You know, thatâs a very tough question to answer because unfortunately we can't run the experiment both ways. What I know is that for almost the entire quarter, until we got into September, the iPhone 3GS was short virtually everywhere. What I donât know is how many people waited until it was available versus bought a competitive phone and thereâs just -- there is not a good way to tell that.",1
"Still on track to reach 80 countries by year-end for iPhone shipments, iPhone availability?",1
"To be specific, we already shipped the iPhone 3G in over 80 today. We shipped the 3GS in 64 countries as of the end of last quarter and we would forecast that we would be in over 80 by the end of the calendar year with the 3GO.",1
"The last question relates to guidance. Given the account change, in my opinion, GAAP accounting loses some meaning. Can you provide a range of pro forma expectations for December? I think that would be more meaningful to the investment community.",1
Your next question comes from Shaw Wu â Kaufman Brothers.,1
"Nice quarter. I guess a question with regard to the enterprise as well. I think last quarter you may have commented, you know there are several government agencies out there that have kind of 30,000+ iPhone uses installed. I was wondering if we could get an update there on maybe some granular specifics of some of those.",1
"I have a question on I guess the enterprise business. Two questions. First, on your iPhone business, any color you can share with us, the break-out between consumer and enterprise? At least qualitatively and how that has been trending?",1
And then the second question is one of the key features with Snow Leopard is native support for Exchange. Any comment on how that's helping your enterprise effort?,1
"In terms of the iPhone and the corporate market, what I can tell you is that employee demand for iPhone, in the corporate environment, is very strong. Since the launch of the iPhone 3GS, which coupled with the software, made a number of improvements that CIOs were looking for. The iPhone is either being deployed or being piloted in well over 50% of the Fortune 100 and from an international point of view, if you look at Europe, this is true in about 50% of the Financial Times 100. And so we feel very good with the progress that we've made since the iPhone 3GS was announced.",1
"Also, another very key market for us, that some people call enterprise, is that over 350 higher-ed institutions have approved iPhones for their faculty, staff, and students. And in addition to both of these, we continue to be very happy with our sales in the government arena.",1
"In terms of Snow Leopard and Exchange, I don't have any statistics to go over with you yet. It is very early. As you know, we just started shipping SP end of August, last quarter, and so we will see how that does. But it clearly makes it very simple for the Windows user with Exchange working right out of the box.",1
Your next question comes from Brian Marshall â Broadpoint Amtech.,1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share, and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.",1
"And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.",1
"As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $23 billion compared to $15.7 billion in the December quarter last year. We expect gross margins to be about 36% reflecting approximately $52 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.325 billion including about $250 million related to stock-based compensation.",1
"We also entered our eleventh country, with the opening of stores in Barcelona and Madrid. That brings us to a total of 317 stores worldwide as at the end of the quarter, with 84 of them outside the United States. With an average of 301 stores opened during the September quarter, average revenue per store was $11.8 million compared to $7.8 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 52%.",1
"Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, we surpassed cumulative iOS device sales by 125 million last month. During the September quarter, we released iOS 4.1, which builds on the innovations of iOS 4 bringing FaceTime video calling, multi-tasking, folders and Game Center to iPod Touch in addition to iPhone customers.",1
"And in November, we plan to release iOS 4.2 which will bring many of the great new features of iOS 4 to iPad. iOS 4.2 will also include AirPrint, Apple's new printing architecture that automatically finds printers on local networks and enables printing from iOS devices over Wi-Fi without the need to install drivers or download software.",1
"The App Store continues to be an unparalleled success. There are now over 200,000 registered iOS developers who continue to bring outstanding and creative new apps to the iOS platform, including over 65,000 game and entertainment titles and over 30,000 apps designed specifically for iPad.",1
"And we launched iAd in July, which provides marketers with the ability to place interactive ads in popular apps for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. We were very happy with results so far. Customers are loving the media-rich ads and marketers are very pleased with viewer engagement.",1
"I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which had a record-breaking quarter. Retail revenue was $3.57 billion compared to $2.04 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 75%. Our stores sold a record 874,000 Macs compared to 670,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 30%. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the September quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.",1
"We opened 24 stores during the September quarter, 16 of which were outside the United States, including spectacular stores in Beijing, Shanghai, London and Paris. Our new Beijing and Shanghai stores opened on the last day of the quarter, and first-day sales from both stores exceeded all previous store openings. Our four China stores are our highest traffic stores in the world and are among our highest performing.",1
"Retail segment margin was $917 million compared to $564 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted a record 74.5 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 45.9 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 62%.",1
"Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $2.8 billion. The sales value of iPads alone was about $2.7 billion, which yields an ASP of about $645. We were able to increase the supply of iPads over the course of the quarter, building channel inventory by about 500,000 units to end the quarter with between three and four weeks of channel inventory below our target range of four to six weeks.",1
"As we look ahead to fiscal 2011, we see great opportunity to continue our retail growth with our focus on international expansion. In total, we expect to open 40 to 50 stores in our fiscal 2011 with over 50% of them outside the United States. We will also begin replacing several stores in the United States to get them right-sized for Apple's current product line and to meet our service goals.",1
"Total company gross margin was 36.9%, which was 190 basis points above our guidance. About two-thirds of this favorability was driven by lower commodity and other costs, and the remainder was mostly attributable to a better-than-planned mix of iPhone sales.",1
"Operating expenses were $2.07 billion and included $185 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $14 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 21%, about five points below our guidance, largely a result of two factors. First, we had a higher mix of foreign earnings than we planned. Second, we had some discrete one-time tax benefits in the quarter as well. Our tax rate for fiscal 2010 was about 24.5%.",1
"Turning to cash, our cash flow short term and long term marketable securities totaled $51 billion at the end of the September quarter compared to $45.8 billion at the end of the June quarter, an increase of $5.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $5.7 billion. The September quarter was the culmination of a monumental year for Apple. In fiscal 2010, we launched several new Macs; establishing record sales of over $13.6 million and achieving 31% year-over-year sales growth, significantly outpacing the growth of the overall pc market.",1
"We introduced the tremendously popular iPhone 4 with breakthrough features including FaceTime and Retina display fueling full-year sales of 40 million iPhones, an increase of 93% over fiscal 2009. We launched the groundbreaking iPad, selling nearly 7.5 million to delighted customers in two quarters alone. We also brought great new features to iOS and iTunes, and continue to innovate with completely new designs for iPod.",1
"And as a result, we generated record revenue of over $65 billion, an increase of over $22 billion year-over-year or 52%. Earnings of $14 billion grew even faster at 70% year-over-year. To put this growth in a perspective, in fiscal 2010, Apple generated almost five times the revenue and more than 10 times the earnings it did just five years earlier in fiscal 2005.",1
"We are expanding U.S. iPad distribution to include Wal-Mart, Target, Verizon and AT&T stores. We are also expanding distribution internationally.",1
"Enterprise CIOs are adding iPad to their approved device list at an impressive rate. Since the launch of iPad, over 65% of the Fortune 100 is already deploying or piloting iPad. Some recent examples of companies approving iPad include, Procter & Gamble, Lowes, Hyatt, NBC Universal and Novartis.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We're extremely pleased to report the conclusion of a great fiscal year for Apple with outstanding results for the September quarter. Our innovative product lineup is the best ever and customer response has been tremendous. As a result, we set new all-time records for Mac, iPhone and iPad sales in the September quarter, and we are thrilled to report the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple's history.",1
"The iTunes Store also had another strong quarter with revenue over $1 billion. In September, we launched iTunes 10, including a number of new features such as $0.99 TV rentals, AirPlay wireless music playback and Ping, which offers social music discovery to millions of iTunes users in 23 countries. We also introduced new Apple TV which provides a simple way to watch movies and TV shows on your HDTV for the breakthrough price of just $99.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $20.34 billion, an increase of more than $8.1 billion over the prior September quarter's result, representing growth of 67%. The very strong growth was fueled primarily by record iPhone sales, the tremendous popularity of iPad and our best Mac quarter ever.",1
"Operating margin was $5.45 billion, representing 26.8% of revenue. Net income was $4.31 billion, which exceeded our previous quarterly earnings record by $930 million and represented 70% growth over the year-ago quarter's earnings. These results translated to earnings per share of $4.64.",1
"Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We set a new quarterly record with sales of almost 3.9 million Macs, exceeding the previous record established in the June quarter by over 400,000. This represents 27% year-over-year growth, more than double IDC's latest published estimate of 11% growth for the market overall in the September quarter.",1
"We experienced strong double-digit growth in both Mac desktop and portable categories led by very strong sales of iMac which was updated in July and the continued popularity of the MacBook Pro and MacBook. Mac growth was strong in each of our geographic segments, led by Asia-Pacific at 56% year-over-year and Japan at 49%. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.",1
"Moving to our music products, we sold nearly 9.1 million iPods compared to 10.2 million in the year-ago quarter. In September, we announced a great new lineup of iPods for the holiday season, including our redesigned iPod Shuffle featuring clickable buttons, the reinvented iPod Nano with multi-touch and the new iPod touch with Retina display and FaceTime video calling.",1
iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD. iPod also continues to be the top selling MP3 player and gained share internationally year-over-year in most of the countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK. We remain within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory on a look-back basis.,1
I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were extremely pleased to have sold 14.1 million iPhones compared to just under 7.4 million in the previous September quarter. This represents 91% year-over-year growth and is well ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 64% growth for the global smart phone market overall in the September quarter.,1
"Turning to iPad, we're thrilled with its momentum. In just the second quarter of availability, we sold almost 4.2 million iPads with distribution in 26 countries by the end of the September quarter. We're seeing great enthusiasm for iPad from consumers, educators and businesses.",1
"Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessories sales was $8.82 billion during the quarter compared with $4.61 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 92%. The sales value of iPhones alone was about $8.6 billion which yields an ASP of about $610.",1
"At the end of the September quarter, we had iPhone distribution through 166 carriers in 89 countries. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year growth, particularly in Asia, Europe and Japan where iPhone sales more than doubled year-over-year. We were very happy to be shipping iPhone 4 in China as of the last day of the September quarter, and we've been very pleased with the customer response to date.",1
"Last month, J.D. Power and Associates announced that for the fourth consecutive time, Apple ranks highest in its survey of customer satisfaction among manufacturers of smart phones, citing particularly strong performance and ease of operation, operating system, features and physical design.",1
"Adoption of iPhone within the enterprise continues to accelerate. In fact, since we've shipped iPhone 4, we've seen extraordinary growth from 60% to more than 80% of Fortune 500 companies deploying or piloting iPhone. Enterprise CIOs continue to add iPhone to their approved device list worldwide.",1
"Most recently, Fortune 500 companies like Procter & Gamble, General Electric, Pfizer, Allstate, and Cardinal Health and Global 500 accounts such as Aviva Group, Total, Novartis, Roche and Sanofi-Aventis have made iPhone available to their employees.",1
"We ended the quarter with about 3.3 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 825,000 to support the launch of iPhone 4. We continue to have a sizeable backlog and believe we could have sold even more iPhones if we had been able to supply them.",1
Great. Thanks Wamsi. Can we have the next question please?,1
"First, our installed base growth has accelerated and reach an all-time high across each major product category. Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter, with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments. Third, paid subscriptions continued to show strong growth. During the March quarter, we added more than 40 million paid subs sequentially, and we have now reached more than 660 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. This is up $145 million from just a year ago and twice the number of paid subscriptions we are only 2.5 years ago.",1
"Okay. Thank you, Luca. And if I could follow-up, Tim you're in a really enviable place of being pretty far from your net cash neutral objective. At the same time, you're generating a significant amount of cash flow every year. So your capital return strategy has been an extremely successful program in the past, but $90 billion is 3% of your market cap. And on the other hand there are just a lot of assets that arguably have a lot of synergies with Apple in the health care space, the fitness area like Teladoc or [indiscernible] or Netflix in the content area. Why is this not the right time for Apple to perhaps look at such assets instead of buying back stock or maybe do both?",1
"To the question around the channel inventory for iPhone, we grew channel inventory by 3.3 million units during the course of the December quarter. Keep in mind; we started in acquisition where we were below our targeted range. We were significantly short at the beginning of the quarter.",1
"Okay. And I just have clarifications; I don't really have a follow-up question. Luca you had talked about channel inventory increasing, it was 18.4 million for iPhone last quarter. Can you tell us how many more units you had this quarter?",1
"And then I'm not sure if I misheard you, but I think you said your total installed base grew 25% year-over-year. Can you confirm that? Because if services grew at 13% and your installed base grew at 25%, it almost implies your penetration of your installed base, in terms of your ability to sell services, is going down.",1
"So, -- maybe I'm going to start with services, Toni. The reason why we added this -- I think it's page three of our supplemental material, is to try and explain that a couple of steps. The first one is that of the services that we report, there's a portion, about 85% of all of the services that we report is directly tied to the installed base.",1
There is a smaller portion of our services business that is not related to installed base and more related to when we sell a device. A perfect example would be an Apple Care agreement that you purchase at the time of the sale of the device.,1
"And then we are showing that on that portion of installed base driven services business, there is a part that is related to -- where we recognize revenue in terms of the full transaction value. And then there are transactions, like for example, App Store sales, where a portion of the transaction does not get recognized by Apple, but it goes to the developer.",1
"So, when you look at it from a purchase value standpoint, actually in the December quarter, we grew 24%, and for the fiscal 2015, we grew at 23%. So, we are growing at very, very healthy levels okay. And to reconfirm the growth of the installed base, yes, it was over 25%.",1
"Thank you very much. I had a question about gross margin. Luca, you got gross margins of 39% to 39.5% in your guidance and that includes hedging. So, I'm curious about the puts or takes in there.",1
"And so as I look at sort of your -- maybe your broader umbrella point about a question on saturation, the metrics I see would strongly suggest otherwise. For example, almost half of the iPhones that we sold in China last quarter were to people who were buying their first iPhone.",1
"And then can you clarify if within the gross margin this quarter that had the IP licensing contribution, as well? Any color you can give, both on this quarter's gross margin puts and takes, and then also the March quarter. And then I have a follow-up.",1
"Yes. So, -- certainly Shannon, let me start with Q1. I think when you say IP licensing; you mean this patent dispute that was resolved. Yes, it was included in the gross margins and it was worth 40 basis points in the 40.1% that we reported for Q1.",1
"For the second quarter, the puts and takes are actually quite simple. From an FX standpoint, the negative impact on a sequential basis from the December quarter is 50 basis points.",1
"Then of course, I would say by far the largest impact on margins for the quarter is the loss of leverage, because that's part of our seasonal pattern, which gets offset by a favorable commodity environment that we've seen for a number of quarters now. And in a way, it's the other side of the coin of the foreign exchange situation.",1
"Okay. Thanks. And then Tim, can you talk a bit about -- and I apologize, I sort of lost my voice here. Can you talk a bit about leverage within the model? I know you said you want to invest while there's great opportunity in China and all of that.",1
"But given some of the pressures you're seeing, how do you think about where you spend that incremental SG&A dollar and that R&D dollar? And how should we think about it, given you're running $6 billion a quarter?",1
"And certainly if you go outside of China into the other emerging markets, our share is much lower and the LTE penetration is so low, I mean in some cases, it's zero, that it indicates to me that there's still a lot of people, a tremendous number of people in the world, that will buy smartphones and we ought to be able to win over our fair share of those.",1
"The market itself, we don't spend a lot of time on predicting. Our view has always been that if we do -- if we make a great product and have a great experience that we ought to be able to convince enough people to move over.",1
"Yeah. In terms of virtual reality, no, I don't think it's a niche. I think it can be -- it's really cool and has some interesting applications.",1
"And then around facilities, you probably know that we are nearing completion of our new campus here in Cupertino, and so this is the year where we've got our peak requirements in terms of capital.",1
"And then also, how is channel inventory influencing guidance? Do you feel like channel inventory needs to come down, given the demand trends? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"Couple of points here, Katy. Our iPhone ASP was $691 during the December quarter. We couldn't be happier with the level of ASP that we generated in the December quarter. Keep in mind that the foreign exchange impact on that number was $49. So, obviously, the mix of products was very strong. We had great reception for the new iPhones that we launched at the end of September. Of course, we have a very strong mid-tier this year in the portfolio, with 6 and 6 Plus.",1
"But overall, when you look at the outcome during the December quarter, it was very, very strong. So, we feel very good about that and we feel that we have a very, very strong portfolio for iPhone.",1
"On the question around channel inventory, we entered the quarter, the December quarter -- and we mentioned it back in October below our target range of five to seven weeks. We have built a bit of inventory during the course of the December quarter. But we have exited at the low end of the five to seven weeks. So, we feel that we are in good shape there. And we've exited the quarter also on iPad and Mac well within the ranges that we want to have.",1
"And then as a follow-up, back in October you guided fiscal 2016 CapEx up over 30%. What's driving that growth? Can you sort of rank it between equipment purchases, data center, and real estate? And given the slowdown that you started to see in December, are you still comfortable with that level of investment growth? Thanks.",1
"Yes. So that is kind of the ranking, Katy. It starts always for us with our tooling and manufacturing process equipment and that is up a bit year-over-year. Then we've got data centers and data centers is a growing expenditure for us, because, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our installed base of customers and devices is growing, and is growing very significantly. And the data center capacity that we put in place is to provide the services that are tied to the installed base. So, that type of expenditure goes together with the installed base.",1
"From Bernstein, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.",1
Right. I mean can you speak to any of the points around your expectation for the smartphone market or whether you think your replacement cycle has changed or whether your ability to gain share has changed?,1
"Yes. Thank you. I have a question, a follow-up, please. To start, just on iPhones, it looks like your guidance implies about a 15% to 20% unit decline in iPhones for fiscal Q2, which I think, unless you really see a change in demand profile in the second half, suggests that iPhone units will decline year-over-year for fiscal 2016.",1
"And I'd like you to address that question, because the obvious follow-up questions are is that because you believe the smartphone market won't grow or because Apple may be reaching saturation in the market? Is that because Apple's replacement cycle accelerated last year and is decelerating this year and that's why we'll see a decline in units?",1
"Or is there something about Apple's ability to gain share in a market where the market is moving to much lower price points? But I'm wondering, and Tim, maybe you're best to answer it, if you can address what appears likely to be a decline in iPhone units and how we put that in the context of how we should think about that, given some healthy data around switchers that you highlighted.",1
"Toni, we do think that iPhone units will decline in the quarter. We don't think that they will decline to the levels that you're talking about. We aren't projecting beyond the quarter, as Luca mentioned earlier. But at this point in time, we see that Q2 is the toughest compare.",1
"We believe it's the toughest compare because of the year ago quarter also had catch up in it from Q1. If you recall, we were heavily supply constrained throughout the whole of Q1 and so some of that demand moved into Q2.",1
"Plus we're in an environment now that is dramatically different from a macroeconomic point of view than last Q2, from a currency point of view, from the level of which we've had to adjust pricing in several of these markets, and sort pf the overall [Indiscernible] in virtually every country in the world. And so it's really all of those factors that play in there and it's difficult to sort out how much is due to which one.",1
"Yeah, on the R&D, Shannon, we're continuing to invest without pause. We have some great things in the pipeline and we very much believe strongly in investing through downturns, such as the one that everyone is going through.",1
"In terms of SG&A, we obviously seek to throttle expenditures in SG&A to the business level, with the exception of where we're investing in new stores and, for example, our expansion plans in China have not changed.",1
"We are maintaining our investment profile and plans there. We are also continuing to invest in markets where we believe they are great places for Apple for the long-term, like India, as an example of that one.",1
Okay. Let's try the next question please.,1
"And the other follow-up I had was that you've mentioned in recent calls, helpfully, the percent of the base, prior to when the 6 came out, that were now on the larger screen phones. Can you give us an update on what that number is? I think the last time it was in the low 30s. Thanks.",1
"Yeah. So, last question first. The number of people who had an iPhone prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus announcements -- and so this was in September of 2014 that have not yet upgraded to a 6, 6 Plus or 6s or 6s Plus is now 60%. So, another way to think about that is 40% have, 60% have not.",1
"In terms of your initial question about is there some of the compare issue that are people that ran out quickly to buy a 6 and 6 Plus and sort of accelerated? There is no doubt that we had a unbelievable year last year and the Q2 was particularly really, really strong because of the pent-up demand that left from Q1 in addition to Q2. And so there's no doubt about that.",1
"However, I think you can tell from the numbers that Luca is talking about just on the currency side and that's before thinking through the affect that price increases can sometimes have on the business over a period of time, it's clear that the economic piece is large.",1
"Thank you, Kulbinder. Could we have the next question please?",1
"And next we'll hear from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Mr. Milunovich, you may want to check your mute button.",1
And we'll hear from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays.,1
"And finally, even in the markets where today, grandly, it looks fairly bleak, from Russia and Brazil and some of the other economies that are very much tied to our oil-based economies.",1
"Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. A question and a follow-up. As far as the question, Tim, I wanted to get a better sense from you in terms of what is the overarching message of introducing a little more details here around services. Is this really to just reinforce the power of the franchise or the platform at Apple in terms of to really navigate tougher macro times in terms of the higher level recurring revenue, or is it a stepping stone to much more in terms of Apple service, i.e. I think of all the stuff you do on the data center side. Could we eventually have seen, with the help of IBM and Cisco that you eventually move more into the cloud services for the enterprise?",1
"So, good question. We started breaking out services, as you know, in the beginning of fiscal year 2015. And as that business has grown and as it became clear to us that the investors wanted -- investors and analysts wanted more visibility into that business, we've now elected to break it out and show the full size, scope, growth, and make comments on the profitability of it from a transparency point of view.",1
I do think that the assets that we have in this area are huge and I do think that it's probably something that the investment community would want to and should focus more on.,1
"In terms of our future plans, I wouldn't want to comment about any particular thing, but obviously, with breaking this out, we wouldn't be breaking it out if it wasn't an area that was very important to us in the future.",1
"And I wanted to follow-up on the upgrade advance program dynamics. Can you talk a little more about what you're seeing in terms of in-store at the Apple Stores? Are you seeing any sort of dislocation in terms of folks who are moving to the upgrade or finance program, are they moving more toward Apple versus maybe the in-store percentage that used to be related to the carriers?",1
"In other words, are folks just going with Apple now, instead of the carriers, when they buy their phone, as part of these upgrade programs?",1
"Thank you. My question's for Tim on the iPhone business. You talk a lot about the macroeconomic weakness weighing on units, but is some of the issue just that last year replacement got accelerated and this year it's kind of normalizing, and that's kind of a one-time headwind in terms of the unit growth that you see in that business. Is any of that going on, or is that not material, in your view?",1
"Thank you, Brian. Could we have the next question please?",1
And so it's a very rapidly expanding country. And I think the government there is very interested economic reforms and so forth that I think all speak to a really good business environment for the future.,1
"And as you know, we've been putting increasingly more energy in India. India revenue for us in Q1 was up 38%. We also had currency issues in India, as everybody else did. Constant currency growth was 48%.",1
"The population of India is incredibly young. The median age there is 27. I think of the China age being young, at 36, 37 and so 27 is unbelievable. Almost half the people in India are below 25. And so I see the demographics there also being incredibly great for a consumer brand and for people that really want the best products.",1
"In India, India is also incredibly exciting. India's growth, as you know, is very good. It's quickly becoming the fastest growing BRIC country. It's the third largest smartphone market in the world, behind China and the United States.",1
"And so we're continuing on distribution. Obviously, we've got product things in mind and are crafting our products and services with China heavily in mind. We remain very bullish on China and don't subscribe to the doom and gloom kind of predictions frankly.",1
And so I think the demographics are great. We're continuing to invest in retail stores. Angela and her team have been on this very aggressive rollout plan. We now have 28 stores in Greater China and we're on target to have 40 in the summertime of this year.,1
And so there's just an enormous number of people moving into the middle-class. And we think this provides us a great opportunity to win over some of those customers into the Apple ecosystem.,1
"Also, I've talked about this before, but I think it's worth mentioning again, because it's easy to lose perspective with some of the things you read every day, is that the middle-class in China was less than 50 million people in 2010, and by 2020, it's projected to be about half a billion.",1
"Yeah. Brian, good question. In terms of China, the LTE penetration as of the end of last October, which is the last data I've got, was in the mid-20s. And so there's an enormous upgrade cycle there for people that are still running on 3G handsets.",1
"Tim, could you talk a little bit about the next leg of growth in China? Obviously, Apple has done a phenomenal job there, but where do we see the next leg coming from? And also, you mentioned investing in India. Where do you see that over the next two to three years? I think there's 1 billion mobile subscribers there, almost the size of China. Thank you.",1
And we'll hear from Brian White with Drexel.,1
Let's go on to the next question please.,1
Steve?,1
"Obviously, from a cost point of view, the downside of economic stress is that some asset prices get cheaper, commodity prices get cheaper, and that sort of thing. And so I think this is exactly the period that you want to invest and do so confidently.",1
"We do believe that this, too, shall pass and that these countries will be great places and we want to serve customers in there and so we're not retrenching. That's not -- we don't believe in that. We fortunately are strong enough to continue investing and we think it's in Apple's best long-term interest to do so.",1
"Yes, thanks. I appreciate the macro comments as it relates to guidance, but can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking consumers might react from an ASP perspective? Do you expect consumers to move down the product line, given the macro environment?",1
And then virtual reality?,1
Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon.,1
"Apple is in a unique position of strength. We have world class scales in hardware, software and services all under one roof, which lets us innovate in ways that other companies can't.",1
"The vast majority of the services we provide to our customers, for instance, apps, movies and TV shows, are tied to our installed base of devices, rather than to current quarter sales.",1
"For some of these services, such as content, we recognize revenue based on transaction value. For some of the services, such as the App Store, we share a portion of the value of each transaction with the app developer and only recognize revenue on the portion that we keep.",1
"To fully comprehend the scale of the services that we are delivering to our installed base and how fast this business is growing, we look at purchases in addition to revenue. When we aggregate the purchase value of services tied to our installed base during fiscal 2015, it adds up to more than $31 billion. That's an increase of 23% over fiscal 2014.",1
"In the recent December quarter, purchases of installed base services reached $8.9 billion, which is a growth rate of 24% year-over-year.",1
"The size and growth of these services tied to our installed base compare favorably to other services companies you're familiar with. Our installed base services are also quite profitable, with gross margins that, on a purchase value basis, are similar to our company average.",1
"Also, we're very excited by the scale and growth of our active installed base, as we indicate on page four. We define an active device as one that has been engaged with our services within the past 90 days. Our active installed base has recently past 1 billion devices with year-over-year growth of more than 25%.",1
"We have built a huge installed base around four platforms, iOS, Mac OS, watchOS and tvOS. We have tremendously satisfied and loyal customers who are engaged with our services at a fast growing rate. All of this provides us with an unparalleled foundation for the future of Apple business.",1
"So now, I'd like to turn the call to Luca, who will provide more insight into how our platform has grown, followed by details on our record quarterly results.",1
"Let me now turn to the details of our record breaking December quarter. As Tim said, revenue was $75.9 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 2% year-over-year. Our growth was driven by all-time record iPhone sales, all-time record revenue from services, the expanded availability of Apple Watch, and the successful launch of the new Apple TV.",1
We achieved this record revenue performance despite a very large negative impact from the weakness of foreign currency and in constant currency; our revenue growth rate was 8%.,1
"We once again achieved very impressive results in Greater China, with revenue growing 14% year-over-year and 47% sequentially to an all-time record of $18.4 billion. Emerging markets performance was strong overall, up 11% year-over-year and representing 34% of total company revenue for the quarter.",1
"Company gross margin was 40.1%, up sequentially and better than our expectations, mainly due to favorable commodity costs and product mix.",1
"Operating margin was 31.9% of revenue and net income was $18.4 billion, a new all-time record. Diluted earnings per share was $3.28, a 7% year-over-year increase over our previous all-time record and cash flow from operations was very strong, at $27.5 billion.",1
"For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 74.8 million iPhones in the quarter, an increase of 300,000 compared to last December quarter's sensational results. Total iPhone sales grew 76% in India and more than 45% in Korea, Middle East and Africa.",1
"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Each quarter, we report results for our Services category, which includes revenue from iTunes, the App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and some other items. Today, we would like to highlight the major drivers of growth in this category, which we have summarized on page three of our supplemental material.",1
"Now that we have reached this milestone of 1 billion active devices, we felt this would be a great opportunity to share more information on what has become one of the largest service businesses in the world.",1
"In terms of the upgrade program itself, I think over time, it will be meaningful as customers get into a different pattern. How much of that plays out in the Q1 of 2017 range is difficult to say. My own sense would be that the other items I've mentioned are probably more important but I am optimistic about the upgrade program as well.",1
"Consumers have spent billions of dollars with Apple Pay. In the second half of 2015, we saw a significant acceleration in usage, with a growth rate 10 times higher than in the first half of the year.",1
"We've invested through economic uncertainty in the past and we've always come out stronger on the other side. In fact, some of the most important breakthrough products in Apple's history were born as a result of investing through the downturn. We've also seen these times as opportunities to invest in new markets, just as we're doing now in areas such as India and other emerging markets.",1
"Getting back to our record Q1 performance, let me give you some highlights of what we've accomplished since our last quarterly call together. We shipped the amazing new iPad Pro, which has been extremely well received by customers along with a new smart keyboard and revolutionary Apple Pencil.",1
"We launched the all-new Apple TV with its own App Store, laying the foundation for the future of television. We had our best quarter by far for Apple TV sales and the number of apps developed for Apple TV is growing rapidly. Today there are over 3,600 apps delivering everything from games to entertainment to educational programming.",1
"We expanded distribution of Apple Watch to almost 12,000 locations in 48 countries during the quarter. As we expected, we set a new quarterly record for Apple Watch sales, with especially strong sales in the month of December.",1
"We released OS X El Capitan, refining the experience and improving performance for our Mac customers. We also updated the entire iMac family with stunning new retina displays and introduced a new line up of wireless accessories.",1
"We launched Apple Pay in Canada and Australia with American Express and announced plans to bring this amazingly convenient, private, and secure mobile payment experience to China, Hong Kong, Spain and Singapore in the coming year.",1
There are now over 5 million contactless payment ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay is live today and it's soon to be accepted at thousands of Exxon and Mobil branded stations across the U.S. via their Speedpass+ app.,1
"So, as a result, our install base has been growing very fast and has recently reached a major milestone, crossing 1 billion active devices for the first time. This is an unbelievable asset for us. Because our install base has grown quickly, we have also seen an acceleration in the growth of our services business, another large and important source of recurring revenues.",1
"Finally, we also shared the incredible Apple Music experience with even more listeners, with over 10 million paying subscribers less than four months since customers began paying for the service.",1
"Our financial position has never been stronger. We had the mother of all balance sheets, with almost $216 billion in cash, which translates to nearly $39 per diluted share of Apple stock. We continue to invest confidently in our future and we also continue to return capital to our shareholders at a rapid pace.",1
"Our investors have been asking for a while about the recurring nature of our business. Especially during a period of economic uncertainty, we believe it is important to appreciate that a significant portion of Apple's revenue recurs over time.",1
"First and foremost, our customer satisfaction and retention rates are second to none and provide us with a long lasting foundation. For example, recent consumer surveys by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, measured an incredible 99% customer satisfaction rate for iPhone 6S and 6S Plus and an equally impressive 97% rate for the iPad Air 2. They also indicate that our iPhone loyalty rate is almost twice as strong as the next highest brand.",1
"In addition, a growing portion of our revenue is directly driven by our existing install base. Because our customers are very satisfied and engaged, they spend a lot of time on their devices and purchase apps, content, and other services.",1
"They also are very likely to buy other Apple products or replace the one that they own. And because of the enduring value of the device, their replacing is likely higher to be given or sold to someone who will also love and use it often.",1
"Sales were also up 20% or more in many western European countries and grew 18% in Mainland China. iPhone ASP was $691 compared to $687 in the year ago quarter, in spite of a very unfavorable foreign exchange impact.",1
"We continue to see very strong interest in iPhone not only with consumers but also with business users. Among corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter, 451 Research found that 79% planned to purchase iPhones. That is the highest iPhone purchase intent in the eight-year history of the survey.",1
We started the quarter below our channel inventory target range and thanks to an extremely successful manufacturing ramp; we were able to exit the quarter slightly above the low end of our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory.,1
"One of the things that we've done to respond to the foreign exchange situation has been to increase the price of some of our products in certain international markets. That has had the effect of protecting our margins, which you've seen have been very strong, both in the December quarter and in the guidance that we provide for the March quarter.",1
Your first question will come from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.,1
"Hi, thank you very much. Just in terms of your March quarter guidance, it does imply a double-digit decline at the midpoint. Maybe if you can just clarify, first of all, what FX headwind is embedded in that?",1
"And then just going to the fundamental underpinning reasons for that, how much of it do you think has to do with international markets in terms of weakening demand and how much of that do you think is comps versus any other factors you might identify, such as a response to higher prices for the iPhone in certain overseas markets?",1
"Thank you, Simona. Let me take this one. In constant currency, when you look at it for the March quarter, revenue would be down between 5% and 10%. So, we are looking at a 400 basis point impact from foreign exchange for the March quarter.",1
"You talked about a number of issues that are, in fact, included in this guidance. In addition to lapping, of course, a very strong year ago quarter -- just remind you that revenue growth a year ago was up 27%, there's a number of things that we're facing.",1
"The macroeconomic environment is weakening. When you think about all the -- particularly all the commodity-driven economies, Brazil and Russia and emerging markets, but also Canada, Australia in developed markets, clearly the economy is significantly weaker than a year ago. We talked about the unfavorable FX, which again is 400 basis points.",1
"But inevitably over time, higher prices affect demand and so we're capturing that in our guidance. So, I would say these are the major reasons and the drivers for the guidance on revenue.",1
"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.3 million Macs compared to 5.5 million last year, a decline of 4%. We continued our long running trend of PC market share gains, based on IDC's latest estimate of an 11% global market contraction, and we were especially happy with 27% year-over-year Mac sales growth in Mainland China. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.",1
"Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question please?",1
"And next from Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.",1
"Good afternoon. Tim, could you talk a little bit about the iPhone upgrade program and the theme of iPhone as a subscription? In particular, do you believe that this could have a measurable impact on the December quarter once we anniversary this? And then any thoughts on rolled outside the U.S. when that program would.",1
"And I guess my follow-up question would be I know you can't talk about new products, but any high level thoughts on the virtual reality theme. Do you think this is more of a geeky niche or something that could go mainstream?",1
"On your first question about iPhone, I think the most important thing, Gene, as you know for us, will always be the product and the experience. And so that's first and foremost. Secondly, I would say we were blown away by the level of Android switchers that we had last quarter. It was the highest ever by far. And so we see that as a huge opportunity.",1
"Thirdly, the markets, sort of the emerging markets broader than BRIC, but including all of emerging, when I look at our share in these markets and the LTE penetration, I see huge opportunities.",1
"As you know, we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter and it's difficult for us to forecast economic and foreign exchange factors; however, at this point, we believe the March quarter faces the most difficult year-over-year compare relative to the rest of the year.",1
"We expect gross margin to be between 39% and 39.5%. We believe these are extremely strong margins in light of the headwinds we face from foreign exchange and the sequential loss of leverage. We expect OpEx to be between $6 billion and $6.1 billion, we expect OI&E to be about $325 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%.",1
We expect revenue to be between $50 billion and $53 billion. We are providing a wider range for revenue than usual for the second quarter because of the volatility we are seeing in the economy and in the financial and currency markets.,1
"As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"We also plan to be very active in the U.S. and international debt markets in 2016, in order to fund our capital return activities. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock payable on February 11, 2016, to shareholders of record as of February 8, 2016.",1
"We have now completed over $153 billion of our $200 billion program, including $110 billion in share repurchases. As we have done in the past, we plan to provide an update on our capital return program when we report our second quarter results in April.",1
"We returned over $9 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $3 billion to repurchase 26 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched our sixth accelerated share repurchase program, spending $3 billion and receiving an initial delivery of 20.4 million shares.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $215.7 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.1 billion. $200 billion of this cash or 93% of the total was outside the United States.",1
"Revenue from other products grew strongly, up 62% over last year, thanks to the growing contribution from Apple Watch, as well as the successful launch of the new Apple TV, both of which established new all-time quarterly records. We expanded Apple Watch distribution significantly over the course of the quarter and we experienced especially strong results during the holiday buying season.",1
"Revenue from the App Store increased 27% and the number of transacting customers grew 18%, also setting an all-time record. Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes stores, the average amount spent per customer reached an all-time high in the December quarter.",1
"Turning to services, we generated almost $6.1 billion in revenue, including $548 million we received from a patent infringement dispute. Excluding that amount, our services revenue was $5.5 billion, a new all-time record and an increase of 15% over last year, thanks in large part to strong growth from apps.",1
"We are also continuing to grow our mobility partner program. We added more than 25 partners in the December quarter, bringing the total to over 90. One great example of our progress in the enterprise is Eli Lilly, who boosted sales productivity by equipping 15,000 field based personnel across the world with iPad. A leader in mobile technology, Lilly has eliminated laptops in the field and is upgrading its U.S. field sales teams to iPad Pro.",1
"Our partnership with Cisco has gained significant momentum since we announced it at the end of August. Our engineering teams are on track to deliver exciting new capabilities that create a fast lane for iOS business users by optimizing Cisco networks for iOS devices and apps, integrate iPhone with Cisco enterprise environments and provide unique collaboration opportunities on iPhone and iPad.",1
"Our enterprise initiatives continue to expand. IBM released 48 new IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps in the December quarter and there are now over 100 apps in the IBM MobileFirst for iOS catalog for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch.",1
"iPad customer metrics are also extremely positive. In November, 451 Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2 and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 65% plan to purchase an iPad. Corporate buyers reported a 95% satisfaction rate for iPad and a March quarter purchase intent of 73%.",1
"In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 85% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by IDC indicates that iPad accounts for 67% of the U.S. commercial tablet market comprising enterprise, government, and education.",1
"Turning to iPad, we sold 16.1 million, compared to 21.4 million in the year ago quarter, and we exited the quarter within our five to seven-week target range of iPad channel inventory.",1
"No, I don't -- honestly, this has nothing to do with wanting to move customers from one person to another. This has to do with wanting to provide customers a very simple way to upgrade. Because we serve a significant number of customers in the Apple Store who want the iPhone when it's new and when it comes out, and so we've designed a program that made it simple and easy to do that. I have no idea over time how the percentage of the sales will vary between carriers and the Apple retail store, but that's not our overriding objective.",1
"Thank you, Mark. We have time for one more question.",1
"Our results were terrific all around the world with double digit revenue growth in all our geographic segments, an all-time quarterly record in the vast majority of markets we track, including the U.S., Western Europe, Japan, Canada Australia and Korea, as well as Mainland China, Latin America, The Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, and India.",1
"When we look at it geographically, I think we see different developments. For example, we felt very, very good about the unit growth that we had in many markets around the world. You've been quoting an overall total company growth rate. But when we look at a country-specific level, there were a lot of countries, I would say the majority of the countries, where iPhone units grew strong double digits, starting here in the United States, where for example, the fact that annual upgrade programs are becoming more and more popular is proving to be a positive for us. Same happened in a number of countries around the world, starting with Canada and Australia but also many places in Western Europe as well. Japan grew double digits in terms of units. So I think geographically we are seeing very, very good performance.",1
"That's a big question, and I don't have the answer in front of me. If you look at iPhone 7 Plus, it was the most popular Plus model that we've ever had. It set a unit record, so that I can share. In terms of how are we going to do, we don't provide guidance at the segment level. But sitting here today, for Q2, I wouldn't expect the year-over-year performance to be dramatically different than the year-over-year performance in Q1. The real comp really begins in the following quarter to a more significant degree, and we'll have to see how that plays out as we get closer to it.",1
"From Bernstein, Toni Sacconaghi.",1
"Yes, thank you. I just wanted to better understand the upgrade rate dynamics. So I think iPhone units on a sell-through basis were up about 8%. You had an extra week, which gave you about 8%. I understand there were differences of the timing of the launch. So making all those adjustments, it looks like iPhone units were probably up low single digits. But, Luca, you alluded to the fact that your install base was growing double digits. So that would suggest to me that the upgrade rate, the upgrade percentage is actually declining.",1
"And more specifically, I'd just like your broader perspective on how investors should think about upgrade rates. It looked like they peaked in the iPhone 6 cycle, and it looks like they've been extending â going lower. Replacement cycles have been extending over the last couple years. I think some of the U.S. carriers alluded to that as well.",1
So I'm wondering if you could step back and just talk a little bit more broadly about how investors should think about or what the trajectory has been over the last two years and how investors should think going forward. Do you believe there are opportunities for that upgrade rate to improve or replacement cycles to accelerate going forward? And what are some of the considerations we should think about?,1
"I think it's a good question, a number of points that I want to make. Starting with the growth in the install base of iPhones, yes, it's growing strong double digits, and that's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's a big driver for our Services business.",1
"The point that I think I need to make when you think about upgrade rates, clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn't help us. Could we sell significantly more and significantly faster from an upgrade cycle standpoint in places outside the United States, where we've been forced to increase prices by up to 20%, 30%, 40% in certain countries? And you think about the impact that this is having on local demand, obviously that doesn't help us.",1
"Simona, it's Tim. We did have an exceptional quarter with iPhone, and that was with the backdrop of not predicting the demand very well on the iPhone 7 Plus and therefore being in constraint on it through the quarter. If you look at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we've seen in any quarter. And if you look at the switcher number, it's the highest that we've seen in any quarter. If you look at the upgrade rate, it's similar to last year. However, I think the big asterisk â I share all this with you for transparency's sake. I would tell you that the way we look at this is in a quarter where you have a supply constraint, it's difficult to draw too many conclusions from it. But I wanted to share that with you anyway so you have the backdrop.",1
"But overall, I would say as Tim said, when we look at the upgrade rate for and we look at it from the standpoint of the new phones, right, the new generation phones, the upgrade rate, the percentage of people that have upgraded to the new phone has been very similar to what we've seen last year. The 6 cycle was certainly a phenomenal cycle. There was pent-up demand for the larger screen phones. And certainly as we look ahead, we have a role to play. The more we're able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate.",1
"Okay, thank you. Tim, I have a question for you. Back in April 2012, you said on one of these earnings calls that I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it, and I highly prefer to settle versus battle. Yet you recently decided to initiate a lawsuit against Qualcomm. I'm wondering if you can comment on the ostensible change or departure from this viewpoint, and what would be a successful end result of this litigation, and whether you can confirm whether there's any potential gross margin risk in the future as a result of this litigation.",1
"I feel the same way I did in April of 2012. I don't like litigation and view it as a last resort. And so you should take from our filing that we viewed it as we didn't see another way forward. They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with. And so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason and the more expensive it would be therefore for us to innovate.",1
"And so it's somewhat like buying a sofa, and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into. Just from our point of view, this doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts. In addition to that, as a part of their increasingly radical steps they were taking to try to hold up that model, they withheld $1 billion in payments that they owed us. And so we felt like we had no choice was the net of it.",1
"In terms of where it goes, we'll see. I don't like litigation. And so if there's another way, then that would be great, but at this point I don't see it. I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end I think common sense will prevail and the courts will see it for what it is. And so that's the way I see it. Thanks for your question.",1
"Thank you. First, I wanted to ask about the iPad. It looked like it was about to turn possibly even positive. You said it was above your plan, but I think it was pretty well below the Street's expectations. And the ASP deteriorated pretty significantly. I don't know if it's a mix shift. But maybe you can talk about the iPad and what you see going forward.",1
"Thank you, and then just one follow-up on China specifically. As your comps get easier this year, I was curious if you think you're going to be returning to growth in that region. And then just to give us the context, I know you talked about the 6% constant currency increase in revenue in Mainland China. But curious if you strip out the double-digit increase in iPad and MacBook and potentially the mix shift to the iPhone 7 Plus, I'm curious what underlying iPhone units did in Mainland China.",1
"Hi, thank you. I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the iPhone upside in the quarter with record revenues in every region except for Greater China. I think you touched on the percent of switchers in China. But can you give a little more color on the split of upgrades and switchers in some of the other regions and overall as well?",1
"Yeah, I'll take this one. If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12%, and about 4 points of that was currency related, so it's an 8 point decline in constant currency. And then within Greater China, if you look at the PRC, our revenue was flat year over year, and that was against the all-time record quarter. And if you look at that on a constant currency basis, it was actually up 6%. So it's a significantly better performance on every way you look at it versus what we had experienced the prior three quarters.",1
"You were asking about the margin profile. We said many times, in aggregate our Services business tends to have margins that are above company average. They are accretive, so they help us quite a bit from a margin standpoint. Within the Services business, we have very different margin profiles, also because, as you know, we account for some of these services in different ways. In some cases, we transact on a buy/sell basis. In other cases, we perform as agents, for example, to our developers, and that drives different margin percentages.",1
"That said, the challenges that are there are, one, the currency has devalued 6% year over year. And two, Hong Kong remains a very, very difficult market. And so I look at it in â I'm encouraged with the significant improvement, but we're not without challenges there. And I wouldn't want to imply that, although I do like many, many things that I've seen and how broad-based the pluses were across our product line.",1
"Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you talk a bit more about the Services business? And what I'm trying to figure out is I think the number was you're going to be doubling within the next four years, at least that's your expectation. So what gets you there? I don't know, maybe if you talk about geographies and how penetrated you are in certain geographies. And then, as you grow your Services business, is there anything we should keep in mind from a margin perspective? Would these be lower margin services or similar, just so we can think about the trajectory and the contribution to the bottom line.",1
"Yeah, Shannon, I'll take it. Obviously, within the Services business, we have a number of categories. The App Store is the one that is driving significant growth right now. I said in my opening comments that we grew 43% 13 weeks over 13 weeks, a little even more for the quarter, right.",1
"And what we like about the App Store is that it's truly a global platform. So we are seeing significant growth not only in the developed markets, where you expect to see a lot of transaction volume, but we see great growth in places like China, for example. And we know that there are parts of the world where we can do better. We can grow, for example, our developer community in a number of emerging markets. And so as we look, as I was explaining earlier, as we look at the number of people that transact growing double digits, we see the amount spent per paid account growing so well, we think that the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth.",1
"On the music front, we are the market leader in digital music. Obviously now, by having the combination of the download business with the streaming service, which we didn't have until recently, we've been able to bring our music business back to growth. We've grown over the last three quarters, and we feel very good about that. Tim has talked about original content. We've had very good success with exclusives. So we know that it's another business that we can grow.",1
"Our iCloud storage business is growing very quickly, and so that is a business that also at a geographic level we can continue to grow significantly. Our AppleCare business is growing very well. A lot of it comes from the fact that our install base of devices around the world continues to grow very well, strong double digits. And as we've explained in the past, the vast majority of the services that we provide is not driven by what we sell during the last 90 days. It's much more driven by the install base, and that gives us a tailwind. We're also opening up several new markets because we are accepting new forms of payment. And therefore, it's easier particularly for international customers to take advantage of our services.",1
"Thank you. And then my follow-up is just in terms of the elasticity of demand and some of the moves from a currency perspective. I think in the past there was some concern in some of the emerging markets the you were basically not able to â you weren't you're getting the volumes because you had to raise ASPs given the currency. But you talked about a lot of the emerging markets actually doing pretty well this quarter. So I'm just curious. You raised the price on the iPhone 7 Plus and that. What are you seeing, and what are your customers saying in terms of willingness to pay up?",1
"From Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Simona Jankowski.",1
"Shannon, I was looking back. Since June of 2014, so we're talking about 2.5 years ago, the dollar has strengthened 25% against the basket of currencies where we do business. And so obviously, it is a difficult situation for us. I've mentioned that foreign exchange is a significant headwind for us, both at the revenue level and at the gross margin level. In emerging markets, it's incredible. The level of interest for our products continues to be phenomenal. The brand continues to be very aspirational. There are more and more people that can afford our products around the world. The middle class is growing in places like China, India, Brazil, but certainly the strong dollar doesn't help us. And therefore, when we make pricing decisions, we need to be very careful. We always want to find the optimal balance between units, revenue, and margin, and it becomes more difficult as the dollar appreciates.",1
"Moving on, we'll hear from Brian White with Drexel.",1
"Luca, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about gross margins. Sales obviously beat the high end of your revenue range. It looks like gross margin was dead down the middle. Can you talk about the puts and takes in gross margins in the quarter, please?",1
"Sure. We were actually at the high end of the range for gross margins. We had guided 38% to 38.5%, and we came in at 38.5% exactly. And really, the slight improvement over the midpoint of the guidance range was due to the fact that our revenue was ahead of our expectations, and so we got a bit more leverage out of the increased revenue levels. We felt very good about the gross margins for the quarter. Again, keep in mind the strong dollar doesn't help us on that front.",1
"Okay. And, Tim, I didn't hear much mentioned about India. How did India perform with the iPhone? And how should we think about it for 2017, especially with the 4G network going up?",1
"That's a really good question. Despite the demonetization move in India that created lots of economic pressure there last quarter, despite that, we had all-time record revenue results, and so we were very happy about that. The demonetization impact has not worked its way through yet. It's still definitely having some overhang. But I think in the longer term, it's a great move, and I feel really good about how we're doing there. We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it's a great place to be.",1
"The iPad, Steve, we had a 1.6 million-unit swing on channel inventory between the years. In the year-ago quarter we increased by 900,000. In this quarter we decreased by 700,000. On top of that and from an ASP point of view, in the year-ago quarter we launched the iPad Pro 13 Edge. That would be the iPad with obviously the highest price on it. We would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the product, and so that would have bolstered the ASPs in that particular quarter. In addition to all of that, we did under-call the number of iPads that would be in demand for the quarter, and that compounded a shortage issue that we had with one of our suppliers. And so all in all, there were quite a few things going on there.",1
"If I zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad. I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product. When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching a penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it's not close to that kind of thing. The customer sat numbers are through the roof. Literally, the customer sat for the iPad Pro is 99%. It's stunning.",1
"And so I see a lot of good things and hope for better results, but we are still currently in this shortage issue now, and I'm not projecting to get out of that totally during the quarter. And so it will damper this quarter somewhat. But again, beyond the 90-day clock, I'm very bullish on iPad.",1
"Worldwide, almost half of our iPad sales were the first-time tablet buyers or those switching to Apple, and thatâs true in some of our most developed markets, including Japan and France. In China, new and switching users made up over 70% of all iPad sales.",1
"Just four months after ARKit launched to the public, weâve already released ARKit 1.5 in beta to developers around the world, and the response has been tremendous. Augmented reality is going to revolutionize many of the experiences we have with mobile devices. And with ARKit, weâre giving developers the most advanced tools on the market to create apps for the most advanced operating system running on the most advanced hardware. This is something only Apple can do.",1
"In addition to the App Store, several other services had a biggest quarter ever, including Apple Music, iCloud and Apple Pay, all of which saw growth in both active users and revenue.",1
"Apple Pay has reached an important milestone in the U.S. As a result of 50% year-over-year growth in merchant adoption, itâs now accepted at more than half of all American retail locations, which includes more than two-thirds of the countryâs top 100 retailers. Now available in 20 markets, global Apple Pay purchase volume more than tripled year-over-year and weâre delighted to be expanding to Brazil in the coming months.",1
"Today, you can use Apple Pay to take a subway in Guangzhou, China, see a concert at Londonâs Wembley Stadium or buy a souvenir in Yosemite National Park. In the U.S., we launched Apple Pay Cash in December, and itâs off to a terrific start. Millions of people are already using it to send and receive money with friends and family quickly, easily and securely; to split a bill, pay someone back, or send last minute gift right from the messages app.",1
"It was our best quarter ever for the Apple Watch with over 50% growth in revenue and units for the fourth quarter in a row and strong double-digit growth in every geographic segment. Sales of Apple Watch Series 3 models were also more than twice the volume of Series 2 a year ago. Apple Watch is the most popular, smart watch in the world and gained market share during the quarter based on the latest estimates from IDC.",1
"It was the third consecutive quarter of growth for iPad revenue, thanks to the strength of both iPad and iPad Pro. Based on the latest data from IDC, we gained share in nearly every market we track with strong outperformance in emerging markets.",1
"For Mac, we launched the all new, iMac Pro in mid-December. Itâs an entirely new product line designed for our Pro users who love the all-in-one design of iMac and require workstation class performance. It's the fastest, most powerful Mac ever, delivering incredible computational power, for simulation and real time 3D rendering, immersive VR and complex photography audio and video projects. Worldwide, 60% of our Mac sales were to first time buyers and switchers and in China, that number was almost 90%.",1
"Okay, that's great, thank you. And then, Tim, investors tend to think of the iPhone as mature and technology improvements as incremental, yet I believe you said there's plenty of runway left in terms of appealing new features. Do you think there are future enhancements coming that will be viewed as material by users, and particularly changes beyond form factor, beyond the way the phone looks? Are there functional things coming over time that you think could surprise people?",1
"We're looking forward to getting HomePod in customersâ hands beginning next week. HomePod is an innovative wireless speaker, which delivers stunning audio quality wherever its placed in the home, thanks to the advanced Apple engineered hardware and software.",1
"Together with Apple Music, HomePod gives you instant access to one of the world's largest music catalogs. And with the intelligence of Siri, itâs a powerful assistant you control through natural voice interaction. We're very happy with the initial response from reviewers who've experienced HomePod ahead of its launch, and we think our customers are going to love this new product.",1
"We believe one of the key issues of the 21st century is education. And because of that, we've strengthened our commitment and investment into initiatives like everyone can code. To find the innovators of the future, we need to nurture the students of today. Our App Development with Swift curriculum, which is available free on iBooks, has been downloaded more than 1.2 million times worldwide with almost half of those coming from here in the United States. Itâs also being taught in dozens of community colleges across the country, putting practical skills in the hands of todayâs jobs seekers.",1
I was in London two weeks ago as we announced that the program was expanding to more than 70 colleges and universities in Europe. Millions of students around the world will have the opportunity to add Swift to their coding vocabulary and gain skills that are essential for todayâs economy. This is an exciting time at Apple and with the best lineup of products and services we've ever had and a set of initiatives that show how business can be a force for good in the world. We could not be more excited about our future.,1
"Now, for more details on the December quarter results, I'd like to turn over the call to Luca.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional, as we set new all-time records for revenue, operating income, net income and earnings per share.",1
"We had an all-time record quarter for the App Store with our best holiday season ever. Weâre seeing great excitement around augmented reality with customers now enjoying over 2,000 ARKit enabled app, spanning every category in the App Store. In December, when PokÃ©mon GO released its new augmented reality features built with ARKit, it jumped the top of the App Store charts. Last week, on a stop in Toronto, I met developers who are hard at work on creative applications using ARKit from art appreciation to ecommerce, and I was very impressed with what I saw.",1
"It was another very strong quarter for services with revenue of $8.5 billion, up 18% over last year, and weâre on pace to achieve our goal of doubling our 2016 services revenue by 2020. The number of paid subscriptions across our services offerings passed 240 million by the end of the December quarter, thatâs an increase of 30 million in the last 90 days alone, which is the largest quarterly growth ever.",1
"Our team has put the technology of tomorrow in our customersâ hands today, set a standard for the next decade of smartphones and we are very proud of their achievements.",1
"I want to take a moment to recognize the tremendous amount of work that went into creating iPhone X. Our teams carried out an extremely complex launch from both an engineering and operations perspective, executing an outstanding product ramp that required years of research and development; one that introduced innovative features like an edge-to-edge Super Retina Display and the TrueDepth Camera, which enables Face ID. Our customers love these new features and the new gestures like simply swiping up from the bottom, which make using iPhone even more intuitive and enjoyable.",1
"Our growth was broad-based and a key driver was iPhone, which generated its highest revenue ever. iPhone X was the best-selling smartphone in the world in the December quarter according to Canalys, and it has been our top selling phone every week since it launched. iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus rounded out the top three iPhones in the quarter. In fact, revenue for our newly launched iPhones was the highest of any lineup in our history, driving total Apple revenue above our guidance range.",1
"It's also our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth with double digit growth in each of our geographic segments around the world. What makes us even more remarkable is that the quarter we're reporting today was 13-weeks long, while the year ago quarter was 14-weeks. When we look at the average revenue per week in the December quarter this year compared to last year, our growth was a stunning 21%.",1
"Turning to the December quarter. We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings. We generated revenue of $88.3 billion, which is above the high-end of our guidance range, and it is up almost $10 billion or 13% over the previous all-time record we set a year ago.",1
"Apple's active installed base reached 1.3 billion devices in January and is at an all-time high for all of our major products. 1.3 billion devices represents an astonishing 30% growth in just two years. It speaks to the strength and reliability of our products and our ecosystem, as well as the loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. It's also fueling tremendous growth in our services business, which Iâll talk about a little later in the call.",1
"Thanks, Nancy and thanks everyone on the call, and welcome to everyone today. Before we dive into the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to talk about a significant milestone we recently crossed.",1
"And I'd like to remind that the quarter weâre reporting today included 13-weeks, whereas the quarter we reported a year ago included 14-weeks.",1
"Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocations and future business outlook.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO, Tim Cook and heâll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, weâll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
Good day. And welcome to this Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. Todayâs call is being recorded.,1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414. And financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570, and I'm at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
"Thank you, Steve. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store, with a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone. The numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. Please enter confirmation code 3378275. And these replays will be available by approximately 5:00 PM Pacific Time today.",1
"I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game. I think there's lots more to do. I think it's become â every year it becomes more important to people's lives and there are more things people are doing with it. I talked a little bit about home automation, but I could have talked about health. I could have talked more about CarPlay. The use of it in the enterprise is growing significantly. And so when I look at all of these things, usage going up, app developers still innovating, we've got some exciting things in the pipeline, I feel really, really good about it. So this is one that we think different about a bunch of things, but maybe this is just one more.",1
"Underneath that, what we've seen is that iPhone 7 was the best-selling smartphone in China during the quarter, according to Kantar. Singles Day, which is a huge day in China, as you know, we were the most popular U.S. brand on Alibaba. We set a new record for Services in China, as the company did. And Mac revenue was up double digit year over year. iPad units were also up double digit in Mainland China, which was obviously different than the trend that we saw in the balance of the world. We also saw 50% of our iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first-time buyers, which is a very high number that we're pleased with. And obviously, our total installed base continues to grow there in the strong double digits.",1
"Perfect. And if I could just switch gears on a follow-up, there has been a fair amount of discussions around your market share in China and what's happening over there. Your numbers actually look fairly impressive in Greater China, China specifically. So could you just talk about what are the demand trends you're seeing there on the ground, and how do you see that transpire through the year?",1
And your final question will come from Jim Suva with Citi.,1
The new MacBook Touch with Touch Bar is an outstanding example of the innovation made possible by integrating world-class hardware and software. We were supply constrained for the new MacBook Pro throughout the December quarter and are just now coming into supply/demand balance.,1
"It was our best quarter ever for Services, with almost $7.2 billion in revenue. App Store customers broke all-time records during the holiday quarter, including $3 billion in purchases in December alone, making it the App Store's single best month ever.",1
"Our innovative and vibrant developer community has created over 2.2 million apps for doing almost anything that you can imagine. Apple's developer community has now earned over $60 billion, including over $20 billion in 2016 alone.",1
"Revenue from our music business grew for the third quarter in a row, and our AppleCare and iPlus storage services had all-time record results.",1
"Apple Pay continued its strong momentum, with the number of users more than tripling over the past year and hundreds of millions of transactions and billions of dollars in purchases in the December quarter alone. Transaction volume was up over 500% year over year as we expanded to four new countries, including Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and Spain, bringing us into a total of 13 markets. Apple Pay on the Web is delivering our partners great results. Nearly 2 million small businesses are accepting invoice payments with Apply Pay through Intuit QuickBooks Online, FreshBooks, and other billing partners. And beginning this quarter, Comcast customers can pay their monthly bill in a single touch with Apple Pay.",1
"Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year. Our Services offerings are now driving over 150 million paid customer subscriptions. This includes our own services and third-party content that we offer on our stores. We feel great about this momentum, and our goal is to double the size of our Services business in the next four years.",1
"The Mac not only returned to growth but generated its highest quarterly revenue ever. Our latest data shows that most Mac customers are buying their first Mac, with the vast majority of them coming from a Windows PC.",1
"It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch, both units and revenues, with holiday demand so strong that we couldn't make enough. Apple Watch is the best-selling smartwatch in the world and also the most loved, with the highest customer satisfaction in its category by a wide margin. Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life, and it is the gold standard for smartwatches. We couldn't be more excited about Apple Watch.",1
"Revenue in the quarter was $78.4 billion, which was above the top of our guidance range. iPhone had a tremendous quarter thanks to exceptional demand that beat our own internal expectations. While iPhone 7 is our most popular model, we saw especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which was a higher portion of the new product mix than we've ever seen with Plus models in the past. Demand for iPhone 7 Plus exceeded supply throughout the quarter, and we came into supply/demand balance in January.",1
"We're also thrilled with the response to AirPods. Customers love the magical experience AirPods are delivering. And if you haven't tried them yet, you'll be delighted when you do. They're far ahead of anything else on the market today, and we're working hard to catch up with the incredible demand.",1
"With AirPods off to a fantastic start, a strong full first year for Apple Watch, and Beats headphones offering a great wireless experience using the Apple-designed W1 chip, we now have a rich lineup of wearable products. Their design, elegance, and ease of use make us very excited about the huge growth potential for wearables going forward.",1
"Our ecosystem is broadening to more and more of the areas where people spend their time, at the gym, on the go, in the home, and on the job. For example, every major automaker is committed to supporting CarPlay with over 200 different models announced, including five of the top 10 selling models in the United States. There are well over 1 million people using CarPlay now, and this continues to grow rapidly.",1
"And we are leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. With Siri and a new Home app in iOS 10, everywhere you go, you can easily and securely control all of your home accessories with your iPhone, iPad, or your Apple Watch.",1
"The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly, with many exciting solutions announced just this month, including video cameras, motion detectors, and sensors for doors, windows, and even water leaks. Perhaps even more importantly, we are unmatched when it comes to securing your home with HomeKit-enabled door locks, garage doors, and alarm systems.",1
"I'm personally using HomeKit accessories and the Home app to integrate iOS into my home routine. Now when I say good morning to Siri, my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go to the living room to relax in the evening, I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace. And when I leave the house, a simple tap on my iPhone turns the lights off, adjusts the thermostat down, and locks the doors. When I return to my house in the evening, as I near my home, the house prepares itself for my arrival automatically by using a simple geofence. This level of home automation was unimaginable just a few years ago, and it's here today with iOS and HomeKit.",1
"iPhone 7 Plus has earned rave reviews for its advanced new features, especially the dual camera system, which produces stunning portraits and high-quality zoom. This is a uniquely Apple feature that is surprising and delighting our users. Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are empowering our customers to be more productive, more engaged, and more expressive than ever by integrating hardware, software, and services to create experiences that only Apple can deliver.",1
"Thank you, Nancy, and good afternoon everyone, and thanks very much for joining us. I'm very happy to share with you the outstanding results of Apple's December quarter. We generated the highest quarterly revenue in Apple's history along with all-time unit and revenue records for iPhone and Apple Watch, all-time revenue records for Services and Mac, and all-time revenue records for four out of our five geographic segments. The strong performance of our business also produced all-time record earnings per share.",1
"Obviously, the quality and the quantity of content that we make available in our services improves all the time. And we also see that as people getting to the platform and start transacting on the platform, and we keep track of their behavior over time, we actually see that they tend to spend more and more over time. And that's why we are excited about the future of the Services business. And that's why, as Tim said, we have a goal that â it's already become a very large business. It's going to be a Fortune 100 company this year, but we have a goal to double it over the next four years.",1
"We always want to offer somebody the -- not -- we don't design to a certain price point. We design a great product and we make it priced at a great value. And today, we're able to offer all three of those different iPhone options.",1
"Thank you very much. A question for Tim and then a detail follow-up for Luca. Tim, with the macro situation changing, a lot of CEOs view that and their strategy is very different go-to-market strategy, some change the way they go to market, some change their products.",1
"In the past, Apple's been very known in always having a premium product. With the slowdown in the macro FX and also GDP revision, is Apple's strategy go-to-market still always at premium product, or is there a need to go to more also a middle market or lower price point to attract more customers? Just because it seems like growing that installed base and services, as you pointed out, really economically could really help out Apple in the long-term.",1
"And then the financial question for Luca is on that patent litigation, Luca, when you gave guidance three months ago, did you have a view that that was coming in? And if so, was that included in the guidance or not, or was that post the quarter guidance?",1
"And I assume it's all one-time this quarter you recorded it, it's all gross margin, and then we don't cause that to reoccur again going forward. Thank you very much.",1
"Our strategy is always to make the best products. And that -- for the smartphone market, that we are able to provide though several different price points for our customers. We have the premium part of our line is the 6s and the 6s Plus.",1
"We also have a mid-price point, with the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. And we continue to offer the iPhone 5s in the market and it continues to do quite well. And so we offer all of those and I don't see us deviating from that approach.",1
"And Jim, on the patent question, yes, obviously this is a one-off item that affected the December quarter. As I said earlier, it's worth 40 basis points. So, without it, our gross margin would have been 39.7%. It will not repeat going forward.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2016 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"To your question around was it included in the guidance, yes, the probability of receiving the amount was incorporated in the development of the guidance range. If you remember, we guided to 39% to 40%, and that number was included within the range.",1
Thank you very much gentlemen.,1
"Thank you, Jim. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks, podcast on the iTunes store, webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and please enter confirmation code 7349088.",1
"These replays will be available by approximately 5:00 PM Pacific Time today. And members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414. Financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570, and I'm at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
"Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated first quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. And after that, we will open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"We're making great progress in the enterprise market alongside our major partners. The combination of iOS and Cisco technology is giving companies everywhere the opportunity to vastly improve the user experience for their mobile employees. With enhanced networking performance, up to eight times faster roaming, better reliability for apps, and native voice experience, we're excited about how much more productive the workforce will be with these great capabilities. In fact, the total number of joint customer opportunities has grown over 70% since last quarter.",1
"Enterprises are using IBM's new Mobile at Scale design and development model to deploy multiple iOS apps with speed and efficiency. For example, Finnair is transforming aircraft maintenance, and CEMEX is revamping activities from attracting new clients to invoicing to after-sales support. And later this spring, SAP will be rolling out its SDK for iOS, providing its community of more than 2.5 million developers the tools to build powerful native iOS apps that leverage the SAP HANA cloud platform. We're delighted with how these partnerships are making it even easier for enterprise customers to transform how work gets done with iOS.",1
"As we reflect on a record-breaking December quarter, I'd like to thank our developers, our business partners, and our employees for their incredible contributions and commitment. And I'd like to thank all of our customers around the world for their excitement and loyalty, which ultimately drive these results.",1
"Yes, thank you. First, Luca, what are the factors that caused you to widen the gross margin guidance for the March quarter? And what are the one or two factors that put you at the low end versus the tailwinds that might put you at the high end of that range? And then I have a follow-up, thank you.",1
"We've now completed $201 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $144 billion in share repurchases. And we plan to provide investors with our annual update on the capital return program in the spring.",1
"Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, as expected.",1
"And as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion. This guidance range includes a $1.2 billion year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 39%. This guidance range includes an 80 basis points sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We expect OpEx to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.",1
"Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend up $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on February 16, 2017 to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2017.",1
"And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?",1
Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Sure, Katy. If you look back at our history, 100 basis points range for gross margin is not unusual. Clearly during a period when foreign exchange is very volatile, we think it's more prudent to broaden the range a bit. I've mentioned that we expect â assuming that rates don't move too much, we expect foreign exchange to be a major negative as we move from the December to the March quarter. You know that the dollar has appreciated significantly toward the end of the December quarter, and so we've got 80 basis points of sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We also have the sequential loss of leverage, which is typical of our seasonality, but we expect to offset these two impacts with cost efficiencies and also with our mix of products and services. So obviously if the dollar is a little less strong than it is today, we could do a bit better on gross margins. Obviously, we continue to work very hard on our cost efficiency, so we'll see where we land.",1
Now I'd like to turn it over to Luca to talk about the quarter in more detail.,1
"Thank you. And, Tim, there's a reasonable probability that you may get access to the $200 billion-plus of cash that's been locked overseas. So I think it would be helpful to just get an update on your views around potentially larger M&A and some of the areas of interest that you've noted in the past like owning more original content to penetrate more of the TV opportunity that the company has long talked about addressing. Thank you.",1
"Katy, I am optimistic given what I'm hearing that there would likely be some sort of tax reform this year, and it does seem like there are people in both parties that would favor repatriation as a part of that. So I think that's very good for the country and good for Apple. What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is. But as I said before, we are always looking at acquisitions. We acquired 15 to 20 companies per year for the last four years. And we look for companies of all sizes, and there's not a size that we would not do based on just the size of it. It's more about the strategic value of it.",1
"In terms of original content, we have put our toe in the water with doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year. We are learning from that, and we'll go from there. The way that we participate in the changes that are going on in the media industry that I fully expect to accelerate from the cable bundle beginning to break down is, one, we started the new Apple TV a year ago, and we're pleased with how that platform has come along. We have more things planned for it but it's come a long way in a year, and it gives us a clear platform to build off of. Two, embedded in the 150 million paid subscriptions that I mentioned in my opening comments, there are a number of third-party services that are a part of that, where we participate economically in some of that by offering our platform in selling and distributing. And then thirdly, we are obviously, with our toe in the water, we're learning a lot about the original content business and thinking about ways that we could play at that. Thanks for the question.",1
We'll go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.,1
"Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess the first question, I really appreciate the information you guys are providing around your Services business, which is up 18% year over year. Can you just talk about? How much of that do you think is growth in your installed base versus increased monetization on a per iOS to iOS basis? And so we are to think about those in two separate tranches?",1
"I think you're absolutely right, Amit. We look at it that those are the two key elements for us. And what is particularly interesting to us is to see that the number of people that are transacting on our stores is increasing strong double-digits, and we're also seeing that the ARPU per paying customer is increasing double digits, right. So it's a combination of the two.",1
"We returned almost $15 billion to investors during a very busy December quarter for our capital return activities. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $5 billion on repurchases of 44.3 million Apple shares through open market transactions. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in an initial delivery and retirement of 44.8 million shares. We also completed our eighth accelerated share repurchase program, retiring an additional 4.4 million shares. This led to a net diluted share count reduction of 65.3 million shares during the quarter.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $246.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $8.5 billion. $230.2 billion of this cash or 94% of the total was outside the United States. We also had $77.1 billion in term debt and $10.5 billion in commercial paper outstanding at quarter end.",1
"Our retail stores experienced strong double-digit growth in visitors and revenue in the December quarter. And we continued to expand our global presence, with plans to open our first store in Singapore and our second store in Dubai soon. We are continually updating our stores and adding new and exciting outreach programs to educate kids on our products, entertain the community with fresh live music, teach future Swift developers to code, and empower entrepreneurs to start, grow, and evolve their businesses.",1
"Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, purchase intention for iPad is more than four times higher than any other brand measured, with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 66% for the March quarter. In fact, businesses of all sizes are choosing iPad and iPhone to have them reimagine their everyday activities. We're seeing strong momentum in sectors such as retail, where iOS solutions are being deployed for everything from product development to logistics to mobile point-of-sale. Companies like Toys ""R"" Us, Coach, and Kate Spade are using iOS and our mobility partner solutions to dramatically transform their customer and employee experiences.",1
"iPad is incredibly successful in the segments of the tablet market where we compete, both in terms of market share and customer metrics. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 85% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in November, 451 Research measured a 94% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Mini, a 97% rate for iPad Air, and 96% for iPad Pro.",1
"Turning to iPad, we sold 13.1 million units, which was ahead of our expectations. And we posted double-digit growth in both Mainland China and India, as we've expanded distribution channels in those countries and we continue to attract a very high percentage of first-time tablet buyers. We also reduced channel inventory by about 700,000 units as opposed to an increase of 900,000 units last year, and we exited the quarter near the low end of our five to seven-week target range.",1
"Next I would like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.4 million Macs and generated our highest-ever quarterly Mac revenue. We were very happy to report double-digit unit growth in several countries, including Japan, Mainland China, India, the Netherlands, and Sweden, as well as in the U.S. education market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our 4 to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory.",1
"The App Store continued its impressive run, breaking all previous revenue records. Year-over-year App Store revenue growth was 43% through the first 13 weeks of the quarter. It's great to see that both average revenue per paying account and the number of paying accounts grew strongly during the quarter. And according to App Annie's latest report, App Store revenue continues to outpace the industry overall, with more than double the revenue of Google Play in calendar 2016.",1
"Turning to Services, we generated an all-time record $7.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year over year. Our run rate growth was actually higher when taking into account two discrete items. On one hand, the 14th week added to Services revenue this December quarter. On the other hand, that benefit was more than offset by the comparison to the one-off $548 million patent infringement payment included in Services revenue a year ago.",1
"Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are exceptional, not only with consumers, but also with business users. In the U.S., for instance, the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 97% customer satisfaction rating among all iPhone owners and a 99% satisfaction rating for owners of iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the iPhone customer satisfaction rating was 94%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter, 78% plan to purchase an iPhone.",1
"Despite stronger demand than last year, we added only 1.2 million units of iPhone channel inventory across the quarter, significantly less than the increase of 3.3 million units a year ago. And we exited the quarter near the low end of our 5 to 7-week target channel inventory range.",1
"We saw double-digit iPhone growth in the U.S., in Canada, Western Europe, Japan, and Australia, and even stronger growth in many emerging markets, including Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Vietnam. iPhone ASP increased to $695 in the December quarter from $619 in the September quarter, driven by the very strong product mix and the amazing success of iPhone 7 Plus.",1
"We had a terrific quarter for iPhone as we sold 78.3 million units, a new all-time record and an increase of 5% over last year. Customer demand was even higher than our reported results, as iPhone unit sell-through was up 8%.",1
"Gross margin was 38.5%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 29.8% of revenue, and net income was $17.9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $3.36, a new all-time record, and cash flow from operations was $27.1 billion.",1
"We had the benefit of a 14th week during the quarter this year, but this was offset by four factors. First, this year we grew China inventory significantly less than a year ago. Second, iPhone 7 launched earlier in the September quarter compared to the iPhone 6s launch the previous year, creating a more difficult comparison for the December quarter this year. Third, the stronger U.S. dollar affected total revenue growth this year by 100 basis points. And fourth, our year-ago revenue included the benefit of a one-off $548 million patent infringement payment. Also, strong customer interest left us in supply/demand imbalance for several of our products throughout the quarter this year.",1
"We accomplished all this despite a very challenging foreign exchange environment due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. As we had expected, our year-over-year performance in Greater China improved significantly relative to the September quarter. Total Greater China segment revenue was down 12%, but revenue from Mainland China was even with the all-time record results from a year ago and grew in constant currency terms. In all other geographic segments, we generated all-time quarterly record results.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $78.4 billion, the highest quarterly revenue in the history of Apple and above our guidance range. As Tim mentioned, the strength of our results was very broad-based, as we set new revenue records for iPhone, for Services, for Mac, and for Apple Watch. We also established new all-time revenue records in most developed and emerging markets, with strong growth rates in many countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada, France, Australia, Brazil, India, Turkey, and Russia.",1
Innovation has always been the reason behind our success and we remain committed to making the best products in the world and expanding the Apple experience to change our customer's lives in better and more meaningful ways.,1
"Despite the economic challenges all over the world, Apple remains incredibly strong. We have a very satisfied and loyal customer base. We saw a greater number of switchers from Android to iPhone than ever in Q1, and we are very optimistic about our business over the long-term.",1
"Notwithstanding these record results, we began to see some signs of economic softness in Greater China earlier this month, most notably in Hong Kong. Beyond the short-term volatility, we remain very confident about the long-term potential of the China market and the large opportunities ahead of us and we are maintaining our investment plans.",1
"My question is for Tim. Youâre at the midpoint of your guidance. It obviously implies a decline in revenue in the quarter coming up, and you havenât done that forever. You came pretty close a couple of quarters ago, but you had some growth. And my question is, are you still a growth company? And should we expect the growth rate to accelerate as we go throughout the year? And why, if thatâs the case?",1
"And so the mix was stronger to the 5S, and it took us some amount of time in order to build the mix that customers were demanding. And as a result, we lost some sort of units for part of the quarter in North America and relative to the world, it took us the bulk of the quarter, almost all the quarter, to get the iPhone 5S into proper supply.",1
"The other thing that happened in North America specifically was that some carriers changed their upgrade policies. And this affected last quarter, and will have some effect on the current quarter. This restricted customers who are used to upgrading earlier than the 24 months that theyâre allowed and sort of stretched the time out to be a hard and fast 24 months. And so thatâs a major factor playing into the North American results.",1
"So as I back up and sort of zoom out on this, and look at it, one of the most important things for us in the iPhone business was to do really well in emerging markets, and we had the best quarter ever from that respect. Another was to grow in China, because I think you canât be in the business that weâre in and not have a reasonable China business. And you can see how we did last quarter, and weâve now followed that up with a deal with China Mobile. And so I feel great about that.",1
"I think part of whatâs happening in North America is a short term effect because of these upgrade policy changes. This affects the period of time, three to six months, I would think, and then it washes through. So as I look at it, I feel very good about where we are, and I would guess that the market numbers, some of the stuff that youâve been seeing, will actually be decreased as the revisions come out, given what youâre hearing and what everyone is saying.",1
"Iâd like to follow that up, just on your comments on China. Youâve characterized the agreement with China Mobile as huge. Could you tell me what would define success for you in China Mobile one and three years out? What ultimately should we be looking at to measure and ultimately determine whether this was huge?",1
"Iâm not going to give you a forecast for it. I think if you just back up and look at it from a common sense point of view, China Mobile has more subscribers than anyone in the world. They have three quarters of a billion, and so I do see it as a watershed moment for Apple, and have a very strong belief in the ability of those two companies to do great things together.",1
"I think itâs important to listen to what Peter said about the guidance, and about the compares year over year, and the point that he made that the underlying sell through, that weâre very confident of growth year over year. And that is the way we look at it. Some people just look at the numbers on a piece of paper, but the way Iâd look at the business is our business from a sell through point of view less iPod, because I think all of us have known for some time that iPod is a declining business.",1
"Also, in Japan, as weâve added Docomo, iPhone units were up 40%. Now, when you translate that performance into revenue in Japan, and we have the issue with the yen that Peter spoke about earlier, and so the revenue growth looks much less than that, because of the strength of the dollar there.",1
"And when you do that, the numbers from last quarter, and the deferral, which weâve just increased, as Peter went through, when you look at that, and look at the numbers from last quarter, it comes up to a double digit growth. And weâre proud of that. I think thatâs a pretty good result. Weâll see how we do in the March quarter, but I do think itâs important in the March quarter to take into consideration sell through versus just a view of sell in.",1
"And I guess thereâs been a lot of things in the media about your potential to buy back more stock, and shares are around $500 tonight. I was wondering if you thought this was a good level, and whether it was time to accelerate the buyback from current levels. You obviously generated a ton of cash in the quarter, and what are your latest thoughts there?",1
"Weâve been buying back stock. As you know, last year we increased the program overall, our cash return, doubling it to $100 billion. And $60 billion of that is buyback, and weâve been progressing on that. Luca can give you the precise numbers of it. So weâre a big believer in buying back the stock, and that doesnât change today, whether the stock goes up or down.",1
"Could you talk a bit more about the gross margin? It did provide an upside surprise to your guidance in the quarter. What were the factors? And then looking forward, what are some of the gives and takes for the March quarter?",1
"Let me answer that one. Let me start with the quarter. We were above the guidance range. It was primarily for two factors. We had favorable product mix, and we had favorable commodity pricing. And so those were the two things that actually helped us come in above the guidance range. For the quarter, for Q2, weâre guiding 37% to 38%, compared to 37.9% in the December quarter. Weâre going to have some loss of leverage, as you can imagine, because of the usual seasonal decline in revenue. But we expect that loss of leverage to be largely offset by cost improvements and also by less deferred revenue that weâre going to have in Q2.",1
"And then regarding overall demand, one thing you didnât mention, Tim, is maturity of the particularly high end smartphone market. I know in our surveys weâre finding, relative to a year ago, a lot higher percentage or Apple buyers already have an Apple handset. So Iâm curious if you think the Western world can show decent unit growth over the next year or two. And I was also wondering, the 5C generally is viewed as having turned out to be pretty light in the mix. What are you going to do with that product going forward?",1
"In North America, we did not do as well, and this weighed our results. Our North American business contracted somewhat year over year. And if you look at the reason for this, one was that as we entered the quarter, and forecasted our iPhone sales, where we achieved what we thought, we actually sold more iPhone 5Ss than we projected.",1
"If you look at the emerging markets, which is one of the things that Iâve alluded to that we have to grow in these areas and grow at reasonable amounts, in Latin America we grew at 76% year over year. In the Middle East and Africa, we grew at 65%. In central and eastern Europe, we grew 115%. In China, we grew at 20%. However, as you know, we just added China Mobile, the largest carrier there, in this quarter, and did not have channel load in China Mobile last quarter. We just started selling those in January.",1
"I have a question on the revenue guidance as well. The ramp of China Mobile would presumably act as a tailwind to the March quarter, yet thatâs not apparent in the numbers. Can you comment on how youâre thinking about demand trends for China Mobile and perhaps how it compares to prior large carrier ramps?",1
And next weâll hear from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"With the addition of Docomo last quarter, we were able to achieve 69% smartphone market share in Japan, which weâre thrilled with. However, the benefit of these two carrier additions this quarter is being partially offset by a couple of things: first of all, the comparison last year from our late launch of the iPhone 5 and the new iPad in Mainland China, achieving supply and demand balance for the Mini and the iMac in the March quarter, and the impact of currency, particularly the yen. And weâre also deferring more revenue on the iOS devices and Mac.",1
"And so to summarize, weâre very, very pleased with what weâre seeing from both carriers. We expect to continue to do well, but weâve got some things that are offsetting it, that we factored into the guidance.",1
"I would add, as a further update, weâve been selling with China Mobile now for about a week, and last week was the best week for activations weâve ever had in China. So itâs been an incredible start, and at this moment, weâre just selling in 16 cities with China Mobile, and as Peter alluded to, this number is projected to be over 300 cities by the end of this year. And so weâve got quite the ramp in front of us, and weâre incredibly excited.",1
"This comes after a new high water mark in China for us last quarter. We grew revenues including our retail stores at 31%, and we had some very, very strong sales on iPad. iPads in greater China were up 64% year over year, Macs were up 28%. This compares to a tablet market in China thatâs growing at 21% per IDC, and a PC market that is contracting by 7%. And so in addition to the great iPhone news with China Mobile and how weâre looking there, we really turned in a stellar quarter in greater China overall, and we are very proud of it.",1
Can you comment on your progress so far in getting down the cost curve for the iPhone/iPad? And would you say youâre in line with the types of improvements youâve seen in cycles prior to the iPhone 5?,1
"You can see that we projected in the guidance, gross margins between 37% and 38%, and thatâs despite going from a holiday quarter to a non-holiday quarter, which we lose quite a bit of leverage from doing that. And so one of the primary things thatâs going on there is cost. So yeah, weâre happy with how weâre doing.",1
"Can you talk a bit more about opportunities in the mobile payment market? And maybe talk about what youâre seeing with regard to use of the touch sensor for mobile payments in your iTunes store, and then how you sort of think about this as an opportunity, whether over time itâs revenue or margin?",1
"As Iâve said before, our objective has always been to make the best, not the most. And we feel weâre doing that. If you look at what we did this year, we announced two iPhones for the first time, rather than one. And looking at last quarter, if you looked at our sell through - so not sell in, but the sell through - of what Iâll just call our entry phone, or mid phone, and our top phone, with the 5S, all of those grew year over year versus the phones that were in those categories previously.",1
"Let me sort of avoid the last part of your question, but in general, weâre seeing that people love being able to buy content, whether itâs music or movies or books, from their iPhone, using Touch ID. Itâs incredibly simple and easy and elegant, and itâs clear that thereâs a lot of opportunity there.",1
"The mobile payments area in general is one that weâve been intrigued with, and that was one of the thoughts behind Touch ID. But weâre not limiting ourselves just to that. So I donât have anything specific to announce today, but you can tell by looking at the demographics of our customers and the amount of commerce that goes through iOS devices versus the competition that itâs a big opportunity on the platform.",1
And weâll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.,1
"I have one for Tim, and then a follow up, please. Tim, I wanted to just step back and talk a little bit about iPhone market share. The market data isnât out for Q1, but if we look at your prior four quarters, fiscal â13, Apple grew its iPhone units about 20%. The market grew in the 40s. I think this quarter, even with a new product and having China front loaded, the iPhone is going to grow at a fraction of ultimately what the market is likely to grow at.",1
"And I know your belief and philosophy historically has been that you want to make the best product, and thatâs the most important thing, but in Macs, youâve actually succeeded in making the best product and being able to gain share. You cited again how youâve gained share in 30 out of the last 31 quarters in Mac. But in iPhone, that is not happening.",1
"And so my question is, what is different about the smartphone market that is not allowing you to hold or gain unit share despite apparently having the best product, and do you propose to do anything differently going forward, because I think itâs great to have an aspiration to make the best products, but I think thatâs in the spirit of ultimately growing at least in line with or faster than the market. And that doesnât appear to be happening.",1
"Well, Iâll sidestep the last question, of course, because itâs about future products. But to your question about the 5S in particular, if I look at the sell through year over year, there was growth in that portion of the line, despite adding an entirely new phone underneath it. And so I think thatâs a good sign, and thatâs despite it being in short supply for the bulk or virtually all of the quarter.",1
"And so I do believe that that category of product can grow in those markets, if youâre thinking about the U.S. and western Europe, for example, and Japan. In Japan, we grew 40% last quarter. Thatâs fairly good.",1
Brian Marshall with ISI Group.,1
"Just a follow up to some of the previous questions. Tim, Iâve got to ask it. In the previous quarters, youâve talked about specifically product categories multiple, and thatâs different than variations of existing products. And that would be by the end of 2014. I just want to be clear thatâs still on track, and consistent with some of the expenses that we talked about earlier in the call?",1
We donât have great data yet from last quarter. And so I donât know the answer to your question.,1
"And then the follow up is around this opex being flat relative to the revenue guidance. Is there something around the vertical in terms of maybe increasing focus on the enterprise vertical that you see an opportunity to take advantage of, maybe hiring more folks to service that industry?",1
"Itâs clear that the enterprise area has huge potential, and weâre doing well from a percentage of companies that are using iPhone and iPad. Itâs up to unbelievable numbers. The iPhone is used in 97% of the Fortune 500, and 91% of the Global 500, and iPad is used in 98% of the Fortune 500 and 93% of the Global 500. And we have a number of accounts, some of which Peter reviewed in the opening remarks, that have tens of thousands of iOS devices working.",1
"And also, as I think was mentioned earlier, 90% of tablet activations in corporations are iPads. And 95% of total app activations were on iOS. And I think thatâs an incredible measure of ultimately how sticky the products are, because you can get so much productivity out of an iPad and an iPhone.",1
"And so I think the road in enterprise is a longer one. The arc is longer than in consumer, which can immediately go out and buy things, etc. And I think weâve done a lot of the groundwork as you can tell from these numbers that Iâve given you, and I would expect that it would have more and more payback in the future.",1
And the next question will come from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.,1
"Yes, absolutely. No change.",1
"Obviously the iPhone business grew about 7% year over year, $200 million in [unintelligible] unit sales now. And thatâs with two new [unintelligible] being launched in the quarter. Can you help us think about how you guys view the iPhone new user growth out there in the marketplace versus simply a solid replacement cycle that the company has in its installed base?",1
"And then second, and this goes back to some of the other themes on the call here too, but youâre obviously going to have a big year in terms of new product categories. And maybe even thinking beyond 2014, when the new products come out and they kind of ramp in 2015, how do you think about the trajectory of the platform, or what would you say to investors to say this is just a product cycle story?",1
"I would just say, innovation is deeply embedded in everybody here, and thereâs still so much of the world that is full of very complex products, etc. We have zero issue coming up with things we want to do that we think we can disrupt in a major way. The challenge is always to focus to the very few that deserve all of our energy. And weâve always done that, and weâre continuing to do that.",1
"A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on Apple.com/investor, and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. And please enter confirmation code 9268358. These replays will be available by approximately 5 p.m. Pacific time today.",1
"And members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896, and financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570, and Iâm at 408-974-5420.",1
"Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead maâam.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri, and after that weâll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information youâll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future products.",1
"Whatâs your user data kind of telling you right now in terms of the replacement cycle? Are you starting to see a lot of heritage Apple users now refresh their iPhone every three years plus, or their iPad every two years plus, versus previous? Are you seeing any major changes there?",1
The next question will come from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.,1
What Luca is saying is that weâre working on things that are things that you see that weâre shipping today but that weâre working on things that you canât see today.,1
"And then just on the comments on R&D and working on things that arenât visible to us, you guys have done a lot of things in recent years, sort of in support of the existing products. Are we to read those comments that youâre working on things that are material new revenue drivers, new potential legs of the stool? Or are these more services that would support the existing customer base?",1
"I think the 5S, people are really intrigued with Touch ID. Itâs a major feature that has excited people. And I think that, associated with the other things that are unique to the 5S, got the 5S to have a significant amount more attention and a higher mix of sales.",1
"Just a quick follow up to some of your comments about demand mix being significantly different, or different than what you thought, in the quarter. Do you have any thoughts on why it was so much different than what you expected it to be?",1
"From Pacific Crest Securities, weâll go to Andy Hargreaves.",1
"As I had said to one of the early questions, the four factors, we expect to be over $2 billion. And the inventory is the largest, and then the other three are less than the inventory and not too terribly far apart.",1
"Okay. Then my follow up for you Peter is, you mentioned four factors that influenced guidance. In particular, you talked about inventory. I think most investors would conclude then December wasnât as good as it looked, if you had increases in channel inventory. So I was hoping you could peel off a little bit and talk about the foreign exchange impact and the higher deferrals. Is there a way to quantify that impact on the guidance in March in particular?",1
"Weâre willing to make any product thatâs a great product. Where our line in the sand is, itâs making something thatâs not fantastic.",1
"Sorry, not price changes, but at least product position. Are you willing to expand the product portfolio into new categories within the phone family?",1
"I think last quarter we did a tremendous job, particularly given the mix was something very different than we thought. It was the first time weâd ever run that particular play before, and demand percentage turned out to be different than we thought. We obviously always look at our results, and conclude what to change moving forward. And if we decide itâs in our best interest to make a change, then weâll make one. Obviously Iâm not going to predict price changes on the earnings call.",1
"I had a question and a follow up. And Tim, for you, the first one, to follow up from Brianâs question, youâre growing iPhones about 7%. I think the market is going to end up looking up to be 14%. Are you happy with the pricing umbrella that you currently have? When you originally brought out iPhones, in subsequent periods you talked about wanting to push some pricing umbrellas. But are you happy with the pricing umbrellas that you have? In particular, as you think about the 5C, I think most of the industry views have panned the product as not being enough features for that price point. But if you could just talk about the positioning of your broader product portfolio on iPhones. Are you happy where you are?",1
Weâll go to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.,1
"Itâs never been stronger. Iâm very confident with the work thatâs going on, and I think our customers are going to love what weâre going to do.",1
"And then with respect to innovation at the company, obviously iPhone came out in 2007, iPad came out in 2010. 2013 came around, weâve got some new products, obviously, but nothing really from our new product category. Do you care to comment on the innovation cycle of the company and the cadence there?",1
"We saw a significant new to iPhone number. Itâs not a number that we throw out, but we particularly saw that on the 5C, which is what we wanted to see. So itâs clearly not just upgraders. As a matter of fact, the upgraders, particularly in North America, would have been less than we thought, because of the changes in the upgrade policy that I talked about earlier.",1
"Let me start, then Tim may want to have some comments. Weâre thrilled to be working with China Mobile, and Docomo also. We had a great launch with both carriers, Docomo in the December quarter and China Mobile just in the last couple of weeks. These carrier additions will have a positive impact on our iPhone sales year over year. China Mobileâs 4G service is only available in 16 cities today, and they plan to complete the rollout of more than 500,000 4G base stations, which will cover more than 340 cities by year-end.",1
"Yes, at the midpoint of the range of our guidance, we are expecting a minor decrease of $50 million. This is largely due to the lower variable expenses that weâre going to have, in line with the seasonal sequential decline in revenue. But one thing that Peter already mentioned in his remarks is that we continue to invest very heavily in R&D. We make investments in areas that are visible to all of you today, but also in areas that are not visible, which weâre very excited about. And for the things that are not visible to you, obviously were impacting ahead of the revenue that these products and services will generate in the future. So there is nothing that is one-off in nature in our guidance.",1
"In the December quarter, despite the turbulent environment, we produced our best results ever in Greater China, with revenue growing 14% over last year, 47% sequentially, and 17% year-over-year in constant currency. These great results were fueled by our highest ever quarterly iPhone sales and record App Store performance.",1
"We have expanded the availability of iBook textbooks in four countries to over 50 countries, so that students and teachers around the world can experience the power of what a textbook can be. We continue to add new titles from key education publishers like Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press. In addition, nearly 25,000 books have been created and published by individual educators using iBooks Author, bringing lessons to life in exciting new ways.",1
"iPad sales were very robust in Mainland China, where sales more than doubled year over year. We also experienced strong iPad sales growth in the Middle East, Latin America, Russia, and parts of Western Europe.",1
"Customers are loving the new iPad Air and iPad Mini, with Retina Display, introduced in October, and response to the more affordable iPad Mini has been very strong. In fact, a November ChangeWave survey of customers planning to buy a tablet within 90 days found that 72% plan to purchase an iPad. And among customers who already owned an iPad, the survey measured a 97% satisfaction rate.",1
"We exited the quarter with 6.2 million units of iPad channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 2.1 million units, which placed us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory.",1
"Based on the latest data published by IDC, iPad has a 78% share of the U.S. commercial tablet market, and iPad continues to spark innovation for businesses around the world. Leveraging custom developed and App Store apps, progressive IT organizations have embraced mobility, armed employees with iPad, and fundamentally changed the way people do their jobs.",1
"British Airways has deployed thousands of iPads to their employees across the business, including senior cabin staff, engineers, check-in staff, pilots, and ground crew. At Kindred Healthcare, iPads are now being used by the sales team, executives, and thousands of therapists nationwide, resulting in millions of dollars of estimated savings and productivity gains for Kindred and their customers.",1
"And this football season, nearly every team in the NFL use iPads as playbooks, replacing their traditional three-ring paper binders. In the education market, schools continue to choose iPad and the great content available across apps, books, and courses. To date, U.S. educational institutions have purchased over 7 million iPads. In fact, weâve sold over 750,000 iPads to K-12 schools in the state of Texas alone, including 7,000 iPads rolling out to all K-12 students in the Midway Independent School District.",1
"And over 1,000 institutions are delivering courses and content through iTunes U. At the Ohio State University, where there are over 20,000 iPads on campus, faculty have developed over 70 iTunes U courses in less than one school year.",1
"Many companies, including Accenture, Cisco, and American Airlines, have tens of thousands of employees using iPhones for work. In fact, some, including Deloitte and GE, have over 50,000 iPhones each on their networks around the world. And based on the latest data published by IDC, combining business, government, and education institutions, iPhone has a 59% share of the U.S. commercial smartphone market.",1
"We remain very focused on providing a great user experience for our iPhone and iPad customers, and weâre extremely pleased that the iOS platform continues to lead the industry in user engagement. According to IBMâs Digital Analytics Benchmark, iOS devices accounted for more than twice the online traffic and more than five times the online sales compared to Android devices on both Black Friday and Christmas Day.",1
"IBM reported that iOS devices represented 32.6% of online traffic on December 25, and more than double the 14.8% for Android. While iOS devices drove 23% of online sales that day, 5x the 4.6% for Android. And, according to the latest reports by TechInsights, iPhone accounted for 54% of North American smartphone web traffic, while iPad accounted for 78% of tablet traffic.",1
"These usage percentages are far greater than the share of the smartphone and tablet markets represented by our devices, and they underscore just how engaging and important our iPhones and iPads are to the people who own them.",1
"Weâre also very pleased with our customersâ adoption of iOS 7. As of this month, 80% of iOS devices are running iOS 7. That dwarfs the single-digit adoption percentage measured for the latest version of the Android operating system, and makes iOS 7 the most popular operating system in the world. The rapid transition to the latest version of iOS provides a more advanced and secure experience for our customers, and a more streamlined opportunity for our developers.",1
"Turning to Mac, we sold 4.8 million Macs, compared to 4.1 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 19%, making this among our best Mac quarters ever. The growth was driven by significantly increased sales of iMac and Macbook Air, while sales of Macbook Pro also remained strong.",1
"Mac sales grew in each of our operating segments, led by Europe and greater China. We were also very pleased to have generated such strong results for our Mac products, particularly given IDCâs most recently published estimate of a 6% year over year contraction in worldwide personal computer sales. Macs have now gained global market share for 30 of the last 31 quarters.",1
"Turning to iPad, despite supply constraints, we sold over 26 million iPads during the quarter, compared to 22.9 million in the year ago quarter. Thatâs an increase of over 3 million iPads, or 14%, and represents a new all-time quarterly sales record.",1
"The release of new iPhones with iOS 7 introduced powerful new security and management features for business and enterprise customers. And iOS 7 has received FIPS 140-2 certification from the U.S. federal government. These features, coupled with ease of developing custom enterprise apps, continue to make iPhone the device of choice for large organizations.",1
"Itâs definitely the latter, and let me have Luca take you through some details.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Weâre very pleased to report the results of the first quarter of Appleâs fiscal year â14. We established new all-time quarterly records for iPhone and iPad sales and had one of our best Mac quarters ever, driving the highest quarterly revenue and operating profit in Appleâs history. We were also very pleased with our results in emerging markets around the world.",1
"I am not going to go into our pricing strategy, but we feel great about the opportunity of getting products to customers and a percentage of those buying other Apple products. And that we have obviously seen evidence of that through history and continue to see evidence of that today.",1
"Thank you Chris. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone, and the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. Please enter confirmation code 1474555. These replays will be available by approximately 5.30 pm Pacific Time today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896 and financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me, with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570, and I'm at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
"Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, maâam.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer. And heâll be joined by CEO Tim Cook, and Vice Vice President and Corporate Controller Luca Maestri for a Q&A session with analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information youâll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, and future products.",1
"Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Appleâs Form 10-K for 2013 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $57.6 billion, up $3.1 billion, or 6%, from the year ago quarter and near the high end of our guidance range. No technology company has ever generated that much revenue in a single quarter, and weâre especially pleased to have generated that record despite foreign exchange headwinds, the year over year decline in iPod sales, and the higher revenue deferral rates from iOS devices and Macs that we discussed last quarter.",1
"We exited the quarter with about 15.3 million total iPhones in channel inventory, which represented a sequential increase of less than 1 million units from the September quarter, and left us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory.",1
"These three factors negatively impacted revenue by about $2.5 billion, and without them, our year over year revenue growth would have been about 10%. Gross margin was 37.9%, above the high end of our guidance range, and operating margin was an all-time record of $17.5 billion, representing 30.3% of revenue. Net income was $13.1 billion, translating to diluted earnings per share of $14.50, a new record.",1
"As for the details of the quarter, Iâd like to begin with iPhone. Despite supply constraints on iPhone 5S, we sold 51 million iPhones compared to 47.8 million in the year ago quarter. Thatâs an increase of over 3 million phones, or 7%, and a new quarterly record.",1
"iPhone sales growth was very strong year over year in Japan, thanks to the addition of NTT Docomo in September and our continued partnership with Softbank and KDDI. In fact, based on the latest data published by Kantar, iPhone accounts for 69% share of the smartphone market in Japan.",1
"We also generated strong year over year iPhone growth in greater China, Latin America, the Middle East, and Russia. In the U.S. market, Apple remains the leading smartphone manufacturer, with iPhone accounting for 41% of smartphone subscribers in the three-month period ending in November, according to ComScore.",1
"Weâre very pleased to have reached a multiyear agreement with China Mobile, the largest network in the world, with over 750 million customers, and to be selling iPhones through their expansive network of stores, beginning on January 17. China is an incredibly important market to Apple, and iOS devices already account for 57% of all mobile web browsing in China.",1
"iPhone customers are loving their phones, and continue to produce the highest loyalty rates in the industry. A December survey of U.S. customers by ChangeWave indicated a 96% customer satisfaction rate for iPhone. And based on the latest data provided by Kantar, iPhone customers have a 90% loyalty rate, significantly higher than the competition.",1
"We were happy to begin selling the all-new Mac Pro last month, manufactured in the U.S., and we had great customer response to OS X Mavericks, now available for free and running on millions of Macs around the world. And we were also delighted to be providing our groundbreaking iWork productivity apps for free of charge to our Mac, iPhone, and iPad customers. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory that was within our 4-5 week target range.",1
"30 years ago this week, Apple launched the Macintosh. Not only was the Macintosh a breakthrough for the personal computer, it was also a promise that the power of technology taken from the few and put in the hands of everyone could change the world. Over the past 30 years, people have done extraordinary things with the Mac, and with the Apple products it inspired.",1
"To coincide with the 30 year mark, weâve taken a look at what people have accomplished on a special website that showcases their Mac stories. Their achievements are a result of Appleâs continued commitment to create and deliver the best technology to people all over the world, every day. Happy Birthday, Mac. Imagine what we can accomplish in the next 30 years.",1
"We expect four factors to negatively impact the year over year revenue comparison by over $2 billion. These are channel inventory increases in the year ago quarter that we donât expect to repeat, lower iPod sales, a stronger U.S. dollar against a number of currencies, particularly the yen and the Australian dollar, and the higher per unit deferral for Mac and iOS devices that I talked about in my prepared remarks.",1
"We are continuing to invest heavily in R&D, in both current revenue generating categories as well as future products and services. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.2%.",1
"In closing, we are very pleased with our record iPhone and iPad sales, the strong performance of our Mac products, and the growth of iTunes software and services revenue. We are thrilled to have the most satisfied, loyal, and engaged customers in our industry, and we are confidently working to make the user experience even better for them. We are continuing to invest heavily in our future, and remain very confident in our new product pipeline.",1
"Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?",1
"[Operator instructions.] First, weâll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.",1
"Peter, revenue guidance embeds a sequential decline thatâs bigger than what you experienced in the March 2013 quarter, and I think implies iPhone units may not grow in the March quarter year on year. So can you just talk about whatâs driving the cautious view on the top line for March?",1
"The biggest reason for the larger sequential decline in revenue this year relates to changes in channel inventory between the years. And Iâll go through some detail, but let me actually do it on a year over year basis. Iâd like to go through some things about the guidance, and I think youâll see that the underlying performance of our business is stronger than what the guidance might imply.",1
"Let me go through these a little more. First, beginning with channel inventory, in the March quarter last year, we increased channel inventory for both iPhone and iPad, whereas this year we increased the channel inventory for both product families in the December quarter, and we exited within our target range of channel inventory.",1
"We continue to be very pleased with the growth of iTunes software and services and the strength of the Apple ecosystem. Total revenue from iTunes software and services was $4.4 billion, an increase of 19% year over year. Our iTunes stores generated record billings of $4.7 billion in the December quarter, thanks primarily to strong growth in App Store sales.",1
"For iPhone, specifically last year, the supply of iPhone 5 was short for the entire December quarter, and we were not able to achieve supply and demand balance for iPhone 5 until the March quarter. As a result, we increased the iPhone inventory last year by about 1.1 million units.",1
"In contrast, this year we executed the fastest rollout for our new iPhones, and we included China in wave one, in the launch in September, and we were able to exit the quarter in supply and demand balance.",1
"For iPad, we introduced the Mini in the December quarter last year, and we were not able to meet demand in any week of the quarter. We didnât reach supply and demand balance for the iPad Mini until the March quarter last year, and we increased inventory in the March quarter by 1.4 million units. In contrast, this year we exited the December quarter near supply and demand balance.",1
"So looking past the inventory changes year-to-year, we expect the value of the underlying sell through to grow year over year, and weâre very confident in what weâre shipping.",1
"Turning to iPod, sales declined by 52% year over year in the December quarter, and we would expect them to continue to decline year over year in the March quarter. And FX is a headwind for us with the strengthening dollar against a number of currencies. So when you consider these factors, weâre very pleased with the underlying performance of the business and the revenue growth is stronger than what the guidance might imply.",1
"And Peter, youâre guiding OpEx flattish sequentially, despite the big revenue downtick. Are there any one-time items in SG&A and R&D in the March quarter? Or is the run rate reflective of investments for future opportunities?",1
"We expect revenue to be between $42 billion and $44 billion, compared to $43.6 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%, reflecting approximately $110 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect opex to be between $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion, including about $590 million related to stock based compensation.",1
"Our board of directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share, payable on February 13, 2014, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 10, 2014. Now, as we move ahead in the March quarter, Iâd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"We paid $2.7 billion in dividends in the quarter, and we executed an additional $5 billion in repurchases of 9.6 million shares of Apple stock during the quarter. This brings us to a cumulative total of over $43 billion in payments for dividends and share repurchases over the last six quarters, of which share buybacks were $28 billion. This has resulted in Q1 retirement of 56.5 million shares and represents 6% of the total shares outstanding prior to the launch of the repurchase program.",1
"Our domestic cash was $34.4 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential decline of $1.1 billion. $124.4 billion, or 78%, of our total cash was offshore at the end of the December quarter, and cash flow from operations was $22.7 billion.",1
"Total company operating expenses were $4.4 billion, and included $572 million in stock based compensation expense, aligning with $246 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 26.2%. And turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with $158.8 billion in cash or short term and long term marketable securities, a sequential increase of $12 billion from the September quarter.",1
"iBeacon transmitters use Bluetooth wireless technology to sense a shopperâs exact location inside an Apple Store and send messages based on the aisle or product the customer is near. For example, customers walking by an iPhone table could receive a message offering to help them check their upgrade eligibility or trade-in value of an existing phone. We expect to see many innovative uses of iBeacon technology from other businesses and developers in the coming months, including retailers and professional sports.",1
"We hosted 114 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, which translates to almost 21,000 visitors per store, per week. We were excited to roll out iBeacon technology at our stores in the U.S. during the quarter, enabling shoppers to receive iPhone notifications about products and services via the Apple Store app.",1
"We completed the remodel of six stores and opened four new stores during the quarter, ending with a total of 420 stores, including 166 outside the United States. With an average of 418 stores open during the December quarter, average revenue per store was $16.7 million, compared to $16.3 million in the year ago quarter. Retail segment income was $1.7 billion.",1
"Iâd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue for the quarter was $7 billion, a new quarterly record, and in increase of 9% from the year ago quarter. The growth was fueled by record iPhone and iPad sales through the stores as well as strong Mac sales.",1
"The seamless integration of the iOS platform, the global reach of our ecosystem, our thoughtful app review process, and our highly engaged customers continue to make the App Store a superior marketplace for our extremely talented developer community.",1
"With the introduction of iOS 7, developers are able to create stunning apps to take advantage of the redesigned user interface and more than 200 new features and APIs. And many of the App Storeâs biggest recent successes, including Candy Crush Saga, Puzzle & Dragons, Minecraft, QuizUp, and Clumsy Ninja, were created by international developers.",1
"Examples of highly successful launches from 2013 include Temple Run 2 and Cut The Rope 2, which generated millions of downloads in multiweek periods of App Store exclusivity. NaturalMotion recently launched Clumsy Ninja exclusively on iOS and saw 10 million downloads in the first week. And Plants Versus Zombies 2 resulted in the biggest game title launch ever for Electronic Artsâ Pop Cap, with 16 million downloads from the App Store in the first five days alone.",1
"And according to a recent report from Distimo, the App Store has a 63% to 37% market share advantage over Google Play in global revenue from apps. Top developers continue to launch their apps first, or exclusively, on the App Store.",1
"In China specifically, we have an incredibly vibrant iOS and Mac developer community. Developers in China have created over 130,000 apps on the App Store to date. A recent study by Business Insider Intelligence indicated that iOS has a 5x advantage over Android when it comes to developer revenue per app download, a 4x advantage in revenue from in-app purchases, and a 2x advantage in revenue from paid downloads plus in-app purchases.",1
"The App Store now offers 1 million apps in 24 categories and cumulative downloads have surpassed 65 billion. Our app developers earned 2 billion from sales in the App Store in the December quarter. That translates to $15 billion in cumulative App Store earnings for our developers, about half of which was generated in the last four quarters, and we are thrilled with the success that they have achieved.",1
"As we mentioned last quarter, we are now deferring a greater amount of revenue for each new iOS device and Mac sold as a result of the free software and associated upgrade rights. At the end of the quarter, our total deferred revenue from all sources was $11.4 billion, and we expect to realize $8.4 billion of it in the next four quarters.",1
"The quarter of iTunes billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of over $2.4 billion, up 14% from the year ago quarter, and a new all-time record. Software and services revenue was about $2 billion, up 26% from the year ago quarter, and also a new record. We achieved these records despite the fact we are now making iPhoto, iMovie, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote free with new iOS device purchases, and weâre also making Mavericks, iLife, and iWork free to our Mac customers.",1
"Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Appleâs Form 10-K for 2014 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. And Iâd also just like to remind you that as we indicated in our last quarterly call, weâre now including the results of our retail stores in the geographic segments where the stores are located and retail is no longer classified as an operating segment.",1
"Weâve also updated our product summary reporting and weâre now reflecting five categories of results; iPhone, iPad, Mac, Services and Other Products. Weâve prepared schedules showing reclassifications of historical operating segment and product results for each of the last 12 quarters to conform to these new groupings and they are available now on our Web site at apple.com/investor.",1
So Iâd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.,1
"Thatâs correct. I think its good clarification. I was talking about the net impact after the hedges. The impact without hedges would be higher. And again this is sequentially right. Because on a year-over-year basis actually the impact is larger, given the fact that currencies have moved during the last 12 months. But the 100 basis points that I quoted includes the mitigating impact of the hedging program.",1
"Yes Rod. Typically, I think, we have clearly active hedging programs of winning the market almost every day, but we tend to hedge three to 12 months out. There are cases where maybe weâve had to go a bit longer, if we feel that we have a strong conviction about certain currencies. Otherwise again the typical period is three to 12 months. And as hedges roll off, we replace them with new hedges. We take into account the exposures that we have around the world, taking into account our most recent forecast and we hedge accordingly. We feel very good about our hedging position and the decisions that weâve made particularly during the summer when we felt that maybe we needed to hedge a bit more than we have done historically.",1
Itâs probably worth pointing out too that there is some markets where we canât economically hedge.,1
Yes. There are some exposures where the cost of hedging is prohibitive or the financial instruments are not there to hedge. And in those cases of course thatâs where you get the full impact of the volatility.,1
Thanks Rod. Could we have the next question please?,1
From RBC Capital Markets weâll go to Amit Daryanani.,1
"I just have two questions. One maybe just on the gross margin side. I want to understand, the 100 basis points of headwind that you're talking about in the March quarter, is that sort of is -- there is some still protection on the hedges or is that a raw number with no hedges in place?",1
"And just, when you think about the iPad and you talked about the IBM partnership where you're seeing some traction. Could you just talk about what sort of penetration do you guys think iPads have on an enterprise side right now and how do you see that improve over the next few quarters as you roll out the MobileFirst modules with IBM.",1
"Itâs a small fraction. Itâs a number that's in the mid-teens or barely in the teens. And so when I look at that I say that there is an enormous amount left. And given there are fair amount of Android units out there, there is also an enormous amount of Android customers that could switch. And Iâd also remind you that there is a lot of people that have not yet bought a smartphone. And I know it doesnât feel like that when youâre sitting in the United States, but from a worldwide point of view there's still lots of them. And so I see all three of those groups there and I'm very excited about all of them, and serving all of them.",1
"We think that what we know, that if you look at the Fortune 500 as an example, weâre in essentially all of the Fortune 500 companies. So the issue is not that, and itâs not a market share number, because our market share is extremely high. The issue is that enterprises, generally speaking are only deploying iPads to a small percentage of their workforce. And so the real opportunity is to bring mobility into the enterprises and change how people work. In order to do that, you obviously need apps that are written to specific jobs, not just apps that are general productivity apps like work processors and spreadsheets and presentation tools et cetera.",1
"And so thatâs one of the things that working with IBM provides us, is both that and the knowledge of the verticals, which they bring a significant amount of knowledge on all of the verticals that I mentioned earlier. And so where can we take that to? I think if we can really change the way people work, I think the opportunity is enormous. Weâre not hanging numbers out there to be measured on at this point, but we donât do a lot of big partnerships as you probably know. And so when we do one, it is significant and itâs because we really believe in it, and we really believe in this one and what it can do for customers.",1
Thank you Amit. Can we have the next question please?,1
From Deutsche Bank weâll hear from Sherri Scribner.,1
Sherri Scribner,1
"Luca, I was hoping you can give us some detail on your expectations for operating expenses going forward. I know youâve been investing pretty significantly in new products, but wanted to see how we should think about those trending over the next couple of quarters?",1
"And then my follow up Iâd like to direct at Luca. Luca, I wonder, could you talk a little bit about the duration of the hedge contracts and the renewal pattern that we should expect to see this year? Just kind of remind us what your typical renewal pattern is and will you be accelerating that this year given all the currency movement?",1
"So I wanted to start off Tim. You talked about the smaller of the user base who have upgraded to iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. And I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on that, maybe even go as far as quantifying how many of the base you think have upgraded and also talk a little bit about the pattern of upgrades? Are they all tending to be over iPhones or is there are good spread? Can you give us any further color on that? Thanks.",1
"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today weâre reporting on a historic quarter and I'm incredibly proud of everyone who contributed to the amazing results youâre about to hear. Interest in Apple products is at an all time high, with over 0.5 billion customer visits to our physical and online stores during the quarter. Demand for iPhone has been staggering, shattering our high expectations with sales of over 74 million units, driven by the unprecedented popularity of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. This volume is hard to comprehend. On average we sold over 34,000 iPhones every hour, 24 hours a day, everyday of the quarter.",1
"When I look at the customer stat on iPad, it's literally off the charts, in some cases a 100%, which is unheard of in surveys to get these kind of customer stat ratings. When I look at the usage, the usage is six times our nearest competitor. The usage is defined as measured in web browsing is like 71% of total tablets, as I think Luca covered earlier. Also the commerce taking place across the iPad is enormous. Essentially over 80% of the commerce on tablets are taking place on iPad. And so when I back up and look at all of these, and I believe that over the long arc of time that the iPad is the great business, I also have visibility obviously of whatâs in the pipeline and feel very, very good about that. That said, I'm not projecting -- to be clear with everyone, I'm not projecting something very different next quarter or the next. I'm thinking over the long run.",1
"Weâve also said the manufacturing ramp that weâve had this year in the December quarter has been the fastest that weâve ever had. And so thatâs also a factor that impacts the sequential compare. And then there's a couple of specific events that happened last year in the March quarter which are not going to repeat this year. One of them is the fact that last year in January we launched China Mobile and we had the subsequent channel sale for China Mobile. That of course is not going to repeat this year. And we also had a very, very strong quarter in Japan in the March quarter a year ago, which was driven by very significant carrier promotional activities, and a pull forward of sales into the March quarter in anticipation of a consumption tax increase that took place on April 1, and again that is not going to repeat. So when you take those factors into account, I think that explains the sequential decline that we see this year. Again I want to point out to the 20% year-over-year growth.",1
"Luca just to confirm, sequentially my math is saying it's about two point incremental revenue headwind. Is that the right way to think about it?",1
From FX?,1
Yes. Currency.,1
"Sequentially, okay. Tim, I was wondering if I could have my -- direct my follow-up to you, which is the iPad. Youâve spoken on prior calls about your enthusiasm for the product on a go forward basis. Over the last year it's down double-digits from a unit perspective and ASP has also been declining. So I was wondering if you could comment on whether your bullishness about the iPad persists and is it really -- do you believe it's a replacement cycle, that we will ultimately see that will start to drive growth or is there really innovation in product that is both necessary and forthcoming thatâs going to drive that growth?",1
"Toni, I am still very optimistic and bullish on iPad over the long run, as Iâve indicated before. When you measure it in these 90-day clips, as we do in the short run, I donât think you're going to see a miraculous change in the -- or an improvement in the year-over-year. But here is what I see when I look at it and the reason that I'm so optimistic. I see that the first time buyer rates are very high. And so by very high, I mean that if you look in some of the developed market like the U.S., Japan, the UK, you would find that 50% of the people are buying an iPad for the first time. If you look in China, it's over 70%. And so that -- when you have that kind of first time buyer rates, you donât have a saturated market.",1
"In terms of what I think is going on, I think what you said is absolutely true, that the upgrade cycle is longer. It's longer than an iPhone, probably between an iPhone and a PC. We havenât been in the business long enough to say that with certainty, but thatâs what we think. There is probably some level of cannibalization that's going on with the Mac on one side and the Phone on the other. And so you probably have a little bit of that that is shaking out. How much, very hard to tell on the early going, particularly since we just shipped the new phones a few months ago.",1
"Thank you, Gene. Could we have the next question please?",1
And so I think there's some things like that are going on. On the other side I think the partnership with IBM and the work that we have going on in the Enterprise is profound. I think weâre really going to change the way people work. I'm really excited about the apps that are coming out and how fast the partnership is getting up and running.,1
"And so I think that can move the dial there. And so I'm not predicting the 90-day clips and so forth, but over long arc of time I really believe that iPad is a great space, a great product and with -- also coupled with the product innovation weâve got, I think there is a very, very bright future for it.",1
"A couple of questions for Tim. First, any updates on Apple TV or your broader biz in the living room? And second a high level question about Apple Pay and some of the successes at point-of-sales. Can you talk a little bit about if in app is important or how important that is? And potentially how the product could evolve over time? Could you see this becoming more consumer to consumer or more just kind of a broader payment platform? Thank you.",1
"Gene, on Apple TV, we had a solid quarter with existing product. Weâve sold 25 million Apple TVs now which at the sake of repeating myself, itâs something that we continue to look at and work on and find a way that we can make even greater contribution than what weâre doing. On Apple Pay, both the contactless payment and the in app are both important. I think they are both huge opportunities. I think theyâll play out differently in different geographic regions as to which one is larger than the other and well likely -- the mix of those things will change over time as more and more commerce flows across apps and so forth.",1
"In terms of how it evolves, I think we're in the first inning on it. I'm not -- we havenât even completed the first inning yet. There's tons of things on our roadmap of adding functionality to it. Weâre obviously -- we're just in the U.S. right now and so there's tons of countries to go to and there is not a day that goes by that I donât get notes from many businesses outside U.S. running Apple Pay and banks and merchants.",1
"And of course we still have a lot of merchants left in the U.S. But I have to tell you that given that weâve launched in October, I'm actually unbelievably shocked, positively shocked at how many merchants were able to implement Apple Pay in the heart of their holiday season, because generally most people sort of lock down and donât do very much. But we were able to get this in a lot of different merchants and I give them a lot of credit for that. But I think weâre just on the front end. And I think that this is the year of Apple Pay. And some of the things you mentioned and others are all things that weâre looking at and in many cases working on in terms of where it can take us.",1
"Sherry, as you know, we provide guidance just for the upcoming quarter. And from what youâve seen from our guidance for the March quarter, weâre guiding to a growth in OpEx on a year-over-year basis that is similar to what weâve experienced during the course of the December quarter. We obviously feel good about the business during the December quarter. Our revenue exceeded in terms of growth, our growth in operating expenses. There's going to be quarters where the opposite is going to happen. Our expense to revenue ratio during the December quarter was that 7.4%. It was the lowest that weâve had in two years. Itâs among the lowest ratios that weâve ever had. But obviously we are investing in the business and we will never under invest in the business.",1
"The majority of the increase will continue to come from R&D, given the fact that weâve expanded our product portfolio and weâre making investments all the time ahead of the revenue that would be generated in the future. We also expect to continue to invest in marketing and advertising. Weâre expanding distribution all over the world. Weâve taken our brand to more places and we continue to open new retail stores around the world. And so the idea for us is to continue to invest in the business, making the right trade-offs and the results from the December quarter give us very good confidence for the future.",1
"I wanted to follow up on your previous comments on the iPhone and the customer composition for the quarter. Considering the iPhone 6 Plus brought you into entirely new segment of smartphone market, can you give us a bit more color on that customer composition for this device? Specifically you mentioned the differences in geographic adoption, but how about on the Android switcher comments you made earlier, and first time adopters relative to the traditional iPhone 6 and your other iPhone models in the past. And I guess related to that, what do you think this tells you about your ASP and unit opportunity for growth in 2015?",1
74.8 million iPhones is an incredible number and it speaks to both the immense popularity of iPhone and the phenomenal execution of our teams to deliver a massive number of devices in such a short period of time.,1
"Speaking first today is Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri and after that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future business outlook.",1
"Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2015 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today that I mentioned earlier, along with today's press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speaks as of their respective dates.",1
"Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us. Today, we're reporting Apple's strongest financial results ever. We generated all-time record quarterly revenue of $75.9 billion in the December quarter, in line with our expectations and up 2% over last year's blockbuster results.",1
"This is a huge accomplishment for our company, especially given the turbulent world around us. In constant currency, our growth rate would have been 8%. Our record revenue and continued strong operating performance also led to an all-time record quarterly net income of $18.4 billion.",1
"We sold 74.8 million iPhones in the December quarter, an all-time high. To put that volume into perspective, it's an average of over 34,000 iPhones an hour, 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 13 straight weeks. It's almost 50% more than our Q1 volume just two years ago and more than four times our volume five years ago.",1
"Our results are particularly impressive, given the challenging global macroeconomic environment. We're seeing extreme conditions unlike anything we've experienced before just about everywhere we look.",1
"Bill, at this point, just shortly after the quarter, we donât have all of our research in from all of the people that bought last quarter. But in the aggregate, as I've mentioned before, we saw more new customers to iPhone than we had ever seen before. And we had a higher rate of Android switchers than we had in the three previous launches. And itâs not that we had more in the fourth one, and I donât what those numbers are, and whether it's something we're looking at. And so between the switchers and the people that are just new to smartphones and selected an iPhone, and our upgrades, which weâre very happy with, but represent a small fraction of our installed base, we feel really great about whatâs in front of us.",1
"Major markets, including Brazil, Russia, Japan, Canada, Southeast Asia, Australia, Turkey and the eurozone, have been impacted by slowing economic growth, falling commodity prices and weakening currencies.",1
"Since the end of fiscal 2014, for instance, the euro and British pound are down double-digits, and major currencies such as the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, and Turkish lira have declined 20% or more. The Brazilian real is down more than 40% and the Russian ruble has declined more than 50%.",1
"66% of Apple's revenue is now generated outside the United States, so foreign currency fluctuations have a very meaningful impact on our results. Page one of our supplemental material illustrates this point.",1
"$100 of Apple's non-U.S. dollar revenue in Q4 of 2014 translated to only $85 last quarter due to the weakening currencies in our international markets. As you can see, the movement has been dramatic. Last quarter alone, the currency impact has been very large.",1
"Page two of our supplemental material illustrates our Q1 revenue and growth rates expressed in constant currency. The 8% growth rate I spoke about earlier translates to $80.8 billion in constant currency revenue, which is $5 billion more than our reported revenue. For perspective, that difference is about the size of the annual revenue of a Fortune 500 company.",1
"We know the conditions in China have been a source of concern for many investors. Last summer, while many companies were experiencing weakness in their China-based results, we were seeing just the opposite, with incredible momentum for iPhone, Mac and the App Store, in particular.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. Before we begin, we want you to know that in addition to our press release and summary data schedule, we've published some supplemental material that we'll be referring to in our remarks today and you can find a link to this supplemental material on our Investor Relations' website, at apple.com/investor. And it's also included as an exhibit in the Form 8-K we filed with the SEC earlier today.",1
"At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1

"Each has a different implementation. And so in some ways, like there is a different set of carriers in every country, there is a different set of banks. In a lot of the countries, some of the processes with the merchants are different. And so itâs an area where there is quite a bit of difference country to country to country and so there's clearly heavy lifting involved to scale. However itâs not something that scares us or thatâs preventing us from viewing it as a big opportunity.",1
"Makes sense. And then a follow up on your Apple Pay commentary. When we look at the opportunity outside of the U.S. are there unique hurdles we should consider as we think about the timing of the rollouts in Europe and Asia, or is it really just about following partnerships together?",1
"First of all, itâs a 20% year-over-year growth that weâre guiding at the top end of the range. So we obviously feel good about a 20% growth. As we look at it on a sequential basis, there's a couple of things that I think is important to point out. I mentioned the foreign exchange headwinds. They are there. We need to deal with them, but they obviously are a negative to revenue. Those are headwinds that we had this year and were not there a year ago. So thatâs one factor.",1
"I was wondering if you could comment on your revenue guidance. Luca you mentioned the range as down 26% to 30% sequentially. I think if you look back over the last three or four Q1 to Q2s, revenues declined more in the 15% to 20% range. As you noted, your iPhone channel inventory is below your target range as well. So if anything, that might be going up. So I'm wondering if you could just discuss a little bit what factors are contributing to this steeper than normal decline this quarter, particularly given your ongoing enthusiasm for the phone.",1
From Bernstein weâll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.,1
"We had a 200,000 unit decline in iPhone channel inventory during December quarter this year, compared to an increase of about 1 million iPhones during the year ago period, and we were not able to reach supply demand balance until this month. This left us below our target range of five to seven weeks of channel inventory on a look forward basis. Weâre now working with about 375 carriers, representing 72% of the worldâs mobile phone subscriber base, and we have over 210,000 points of sale for iPhone across the globe.",1
"With that, Iâd like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our December quarter results in more detail.",1
"Thank you, Tim and good afternoon everyone. In the December quarter we generated all time record revenue of $74.6 billion, an increase of $17 billion, or 30% year-over-year. We achieved this exceptional performance despite significant foreign exchange headwinds from many currencies.",1
"Our growth was broad based across the world, with revenue from developed countries up 20% and revenue from emerging countries up 58%. The performance of our Greater China segment was particularly impressive, with revenue up 70%. Sales were well ahead of our expectations in a number of areas. The unprecedented demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus combined with our tremendously successful production ramp allowed us to build and ship several million more iPhones than we had expected when we provided guidance back in October. And also Mac revenue and services revenue reached all-time highs.",1
"Gross margin was 39.9% above our guidance range and operating margin was $24.2 billion, representing 32.5% of revenue, and our highest operating margin percentage in 10 quarters. Net income was $18 billion, surpassing our previous all-time record by almost $5 billion. This translated to diluted earnings per share of $3.06, a 48% year-over-year increase. Cash flow from operations was exceptional at $33.7 billion, also a new all-time record.",1
"For details by product I will start with iPhone. We sold 74.5 million iPhones, an increase of 23.4 million over last year, representing 46% growth. iPhone sales grew strongly in both developed and emerging markets. Among many great results around the world, unit sales were up 44% in the U.S. and up 97% in the BRIC countries.",1
"Sales doubled year-over-year in China, our second largest iPhone market, as well as in Brazil and in Singapore. Thanks to the popularity of iPhone 6 Plus, and the increased value customers saw in our higher storage capacity offerings, iPhone ASPs were $687, an increase of $50 over the year ago quarter. This led to iPhone revenue growth of 57% year-over-year, with quarterly sales exceeding $50 billion for the first time ever.",1
"Our customers love their iPhones. A December ChangeWave survey measured a 97% customer satisfaction rating for iPhone. A study published by Chitika Insights last month indicated that iPhone accounts for 53% of North America smartphone web traffic, almost twice the level of the next closest brand. And in the corporate market ChangeWave found that among IT buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter this year, 77% intend to purchase iPhones.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $178 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $22.7 billion. We completed our first international debt offering, issuing 2.8 billion euro denominated notes at very attractive interest rates and greatly diversifying our debt investor base. We spent 5 billion to repurchase 45 million Apple shares through open market transactions, paid 2.8 billion in dividends and equivalents, and utilized over 500 million to net share settle vesting employee RSUs. We also retired an additional 8 million shares in connection with our accelerated share repurchase programs.",1
"Next Iâd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.5 million Macs, an increase of almost 700,000 units over last year, a 14% growth rate. Thanks for the popularity of our stunning new iMac with Retina 5K display, Mac ASPs increased by $58 sequentially, driving all time record revenue for Mac of 6.9 billion. We achieved double-digit year-over-year unit growth in both desktops and portables. These results are truly remarkable, given the contraction in the global PC market which IDC estimates declined by 3% in the quarter. We have now gained market share for 34 of the last 35 quarters. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our four to five week target range.",1
"Turning to iPad, we sold 21.4 million units compared to 26 million in the December quarter last year. Given the introduction of new iPads in October, we increased iPad channel inventory by 1.1 million units during the quarter, compared to an increase of about 2.1 million in the December quarter last year. This left us within our five to seven week target range of channel inventory on a look forward basis.",1
"Customer experience and usage data for iPad continue to be excellent. In our November survey, ChangeWave measured a 98% customer satisfaction rate for iPad Air, and also found that among people to finding a purchase a tabled within 90 days, 60% plan to purchase an iPad. And among businesses planning to purchase tablets, the intent was even stronger at 78%.",1
"Chitika Insights' most recent report indicated that iPad users in North America generate over 70% of tablet based web traffic, more than six times the web traffic of the next closest competitor and Custoraâs latest e-commerce report indicates that iPad accounts for 82% of all U.S. e-commerce transactions from tablets.",1
"All these results are consistent with usage data from the holiday shopping season. IBMâs digital analytics benchmark service found that iOS devices accounted for more than twice the online traffic and almost four times the e-commerce sales on Android devices during November and December. The Apple ecosystem continues to thrive. Combining all of our services, revenue grew to 4.8 billion in the December quarter, a new all-time high and an increase of 9% year-over-year.",1
"This record performance was driven primarily by the tremendous momentum of the App Store, with revenue growing 41% in the December quarter. Our iOS developers have earned over $25 billion from the App Store to date, and weâre thrilled with their success. Total sales of media and software from iTunes were $2.6 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in the year ago quarter.",1
Delivering the results weâre reporting today reflects months and years of focus and determination from teams across Apple as well as our amazing developers and business partners. Iâd like to thank all of them for their commitment and performance and Iâd also like to thank our incredible customers for their ongoing loyalty and enthusiasm.,1
"And in December, we undertook our largest ever initiative to help (PRODUCT)RED achieve the goal of an AIDS free generation. To commemorate World AIDS Day, we worked with some of our developer partners to create and donate the proceeds from 25 special apps and we also contributed a portion of sales at our retail and online stores on two of the yearâs busiest shopping days. As a result, Appleâs donation set a new record.",1
"In addition to all these initiatives, we have a robust product and services pipeline that we are very excited about, and we look forward to sharing more about them with you throughout the year. In addition to the contributions we make to humanity through our products, we made great progress on imported projects during the quarter including ConnectED and (PRODUCT)RED. With ConnectED weâre focused on making a difference for students in communities who need it the most. We recently chose 114 schools across 29 states to receive an Apple ConnectED grant. Despite their economic challenges, all of these schools share a vision of what their students' lives would be like with Apple technology and weâre proud to help them bring that to life.",1
"In just over a month, more than a dozen enterprise customers have signed on as foundation clients to transform their companies with iPhone, iPad and IBM MobileFirst solutions including Miami Dade County, the seventh largest county in the United States by population, and American Eagle Outfitters, which operates more than 1,000 retail stores and ships to over 80 countries worldwide. And the list of new customers is expanding rapidly. IBM is engaged with more than 130 additional companies looking to empower their employees with MobileFirst for iOS solutions and the list keeps growing. We couldnât be more pleased with this partnership.",1
"Weâre also making great progress in our partnership with IBM and our collaboration is winning over new customers. In December, we delivered the first 10 MobileFirst for iOS apps for banking, retail, insurance, financial services, telecommunications, governments and airlines, making iPhone and iPad even more productive for enterprises by providing [Apple] [ph] Cloud services with IBM's Big Data and analytics capabilities. Another 12 apps will be released this quarter, including three new industries, healthcare, energy and utilities, and industrial products. This will bring us to a total of 22 apps and weâre on track to have over 100 by the end of 2015.",1
"Development for Apple Watch is right on schedule and we expect to begin shipping in April. Developers are hard at work on apps, notifications and information summaries that we call Glances, all designed specifically for the Watch's user interface. The creativity and software innovation going on around Apple Watch is incredibly exciting and we canât wait for our customers to experience them when Apple Watch becomes available.",1
"More merchants are excited to bring Apple Pay to their customers and adoption is strong. Just today USA Technologies announced they made Apple Pay available at about 200,000 places where everyday payments happen, including vending machines and businesses, airports and schools, commercial laundry machines and colleges, universities and laundromats and parking meters and payment kiosks in lots across the country. Point-of-sale suppliers tell us they are seeing unprecedented demand from merchants, and all of our partners and customers simply love this new service. With all of this momentum in the early days, we are more convinced than ever that 2015 will be the year of Apple Pay.",1
"In merchants who already accept Apple Pay, the rates are even higher. Panera Bread tells us Apple Pay represents nearly 80% of their mobile payment transactions, and since the launch of Apple Pay, Whole Foods Market had seen mobile payments increased by more than 400%. You can use Apple Pay up and down Mainstreet, to pick up a prescription at Walgreens at Duane Reade, get office or school supplies at Office Depot and Staples and shop for groceries at national and regional stores from coast-to-coast, including BI-LO, Harveyâs, Save Mart, Wegmans Food Markets, Whole Foods and Winn-Dixie among others.",1
"Also as you know, we introduced two new categories in the fall and weâre making great progress on both of them. Apple Pay is off to a very strong start and the feedback that we are getting from both individuals and institutions is extremely positive. Today about 750 banks and credit unions have signed on to bring Apple Pay to their customers, and in just three months after launch, Apple Pay makes up more than $2 out of $3 spent on purchases using contactless payment across the three major U.S. card networks.",1
"With HealthKit and the iOS health app, we believe weâre just at the beginning of amazing new health and wellness solutions for our customers. Our extensions of iOS in the home with HomeKit and in the car with CarPlay also continue to progress and this year we are looking forward to amazing HomeKit enabled products from several companies, and CarPlay enabled vehicles from over 30 automotive brands.",1
"For example, with apps such as an American Well, users can securely share data such as blood pressure, weight or activity directly with physicians, and leading hospitals such as Duke Medicine, Stanford Children and Penn Medicine are integrating data from HealthKit into their electronic medical record so that physicians can reach out to patients proactively when they see a problem that needs attention.",1
"There has also been incredible interest in HealthKit with over 600 developers now integrating it into their apps. Consumers can now choose to securely share their health and wellness metrics with these apps and this has led to some great, new and innovative experiences in fitness and wellness, food and nutrition and healthcare.",1
"Weâve seen many of our developers choosing Swift as they build significant new projects, and we are seeing fantastic work with Swift going on in education. Very recently, Stanford University released their Developing iOS 8 Apps with Swift course, which was posted to iTunes University making this amazing resource available to everyone in the world.",1
"Weâve also made great progress on a number of very exciting new initiatives to further strengthen our ecosystem. Weâve been blown away by the reaction to Swift, our new programing language. Inventing a new programing language is something very few companies can do, and we believe it will have a profound effect on our ecosystem. Swift became available in September as part of the Xcode tools and in the first month those tools were downloaded over 11 million times. A recent report from Redmonk showed that Swift has had unprecedented growth and is quickly climbing the list of the most popular programing languages.",1
"Our strong overall performance in the December quarter resulted in total company revenue of $74.6 billion, and earnings of $18 billion. Both of these numbers are all-time records for us, with revenues up 30% and earnings up 38% over last year. And due to our very large capital return activities, earnings per share were up even more at 48% to $3.06, also an all-time quarterly record. Our results would have been even stronger, absent fierce foreign exchange volatility.",1
"It was truly a momentous quarter for iOS. On November 22nd we shipped our 1 billionth iOS device. It was a Space Gray 64 gigabyte iPhone 6 Plus, which weâve saved here at Apple. 1 billion devices is an almost unfathomable milestone, and we are all incredibly proud to be a part of it. Appleâs mission is to make the greatest products on earth and enrich the lives of others. Through the success of iOS we have provided hundreds and millions of people with powerful personal technology that is simple and fun to use. Our customers are using Apple products to transform education, discover new ideas for business and express their creativity in ways that no one could have imagined when we sold the first iPhone less than eight years ago. Itâs amazing to watch and it reminds that people and great ideas are the reasons we make the things we make.",1
"The execution by all of our teams to achieve these results was spectacular. By the end of the quarter, our new iPhones were available in 130 countries around the world, making this our fastest and most successful roll out ever. Additionally, the App Store and the Mac each set new records for quarterly revenues. Mac units were up 14% to 5.5 million, while the rest of the PC market continued to decline. App Store revenues was up a remarkable 41%. Demand was strong around the world. Flurry estimated that Apple products accounted for over half of all mobile device activations globally from December 19th to December 25th.",1
"Our direct China performance was also outstanding. We welcomed more visitors than ever before and generated record revenue in both our physical and online stores. We opened 10 new retail stores during the quarter, bringing us to a total of 447, 182 of which are outside the United States. Weâve opened two new stores this month in Greater China and weâre on track towards 40 stores in Greater China by mid-2016.",1
"We have now taken action on almost $103 billion of our $130 billion capital return program, including $73 billion in share repurchases, with four quarters remaining to its completion. In the last 12 months alone, we have returned over $57 billion to our investors. We review our capital return program on an ongoing basis. We continue to solicit feedback from a broad base of investors and we're on track to announce an update to the program in April when we report our second quarter results.",1
"You can tell by that weâre a big believer in China. Weâre looking at our investment. Weâre growing the number of stores. Weâll hit 20 soon and weâre doubling that by mid-2016 as Angela has said earlier and Luca said in his prepared comments as well. Weâre also growing the channel there. Our online store has expanded to over 350 cities now, and in fact our online revenues in China last quarter were more than the sum of the previous five years. And so itâs an incredible market. I think people love Apple products and we are going to do our best to serve the market.",1
"Katy, youâre right. I mean on both fronts. We certainly expect more favorable cost in the March quarter than weâve seen in the December quarter. It goes with our product cycle. The foreign exchange headwinds as I was explaining to Shannon, they will be on a sequential basis a headwind of more than 100 basis points. So if you were to exclude that foreign exchange impact, we would actually be guiding to sequential increase in margins.",1
"At the end of the quarter, we were within the target range of channel inventory on iPad. In terms of growing channel inventory, in particular on iPhone where weâre outside of it, we wouldnât expect to see a large step function increase. We would expect it to occur more gradually over time than sort of all at once type of thing. But we donât guide to channel inventory specifically as you know.",1
From Morgan Stanley weâll go to Katy Huberty.,1
"So not to dilute the fantastic performance in December, but can you talk a little bit about how you think about the sustainability of this very strong iPhone demand into 2015, particularly given that most carriers had access to that product during the quarter? And then I have a follow up on margin?",1
"Sure Katy. Itâs Tim. You can see from the March guidance that weâve given, that we are incredibly bullish about iPhone going forward. We believe that itâs the best smartphone in the world. Our customers are telling us that. The market is telling us that. Weâre doing well in virtually every corner of the world. And so weâre very bullish that it does have legs. I would point out that only a small fraction of the installed base has upgraded. And so there is a lot more people within the installed base. But I would also point out that we had the highest number of customers new to iPhone last quarter than in any prior launch. And also that the current iPhone line up experienced the highest Android switcher rate in any of the last three launches in the three previous years. And we didnât look back to the other years. So I donât know about those.",1
"And so we see that weâre appealing to new customers, both new to smartphone and new to iPhone and people switching. Weâre very bullish on the product and getting great feedback about the quality of the products weâre shipping. And so weâre very, very bullish. The emerging markets which has been a source to great questions over time, the growth was absolutely stunning, in Brazil and Mainland China more than doubling year-over-year which is 3x to 4x what those markets were doing according to IDC. And so we enter the quarter with quite a bit of momentum.",1
"And Luca as you know, you typically enjoy component cost downs and yield improvements as you move through a product cycle. Is there anything other than currency that keeps you from potentially locking the gross margins higher over the course of the year? Thank you.",1
"The other element that is there and itâs very seasonal, itâs always there, itâs the loss of leverage that we got from Q1 to Q2. When you look at our revenue guidance, we are guiding to a sequential decline between 26% and 30%. So you obviously have that loss of leverage, but without a doubt the biggest headwind that we got right now is foreign exchange. Having said all that guiding 38.5% to 39.5%, we feel slightly very good about where we are right now in the cycle.",1
"Now as we move ahead into the March quarter, Iâd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $52 billion and $55 billion, compared to $45.6 billion in the year ago quarter, and this represents a very significant revenue increase, despite growing foreign exchange headwinds from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies.",1
Katie could we have the next question please?,1
"Weâll go to Benjamin Reitzes, Barclays.",1
"And Tim obviously a lot of good questions about the great iPhone number but I wanted to ask about the Apple Watch. Shifting in April, month or two later than I think you said originally obviously, probably not that big a deal, but whatâs going on with that product in a little more detail in terms of the timing and your excitement for it and maybe a little more color on other apps that could be available at launch? And any expectations you have for it would be great.",1
"My expectations are very high on it. I'm using it every day and love it and I canât live without it. So I see that weâre making great progress on the development of it. The number of developers that are writing apps more for it are impressive and weâre seeing some incredible innovation coming out there. And just to clarify, what we had been saying was early 2015, and we sort of look at the year and think of early as the first four months, mid is the next four months and late is the final four months. And so to us it's sort of within the range and itâs basically when we thought. Weâre going to -- but most importantly weâre going to be thrilled to start shipping it, because we got a lot of customers that are wanting to get one.",1
"And then just a follow-up in terms of China. How do you feel the momentum there is in terms of sustainability versus some of the local competition, and as you navigate that market specifically going forward?",1
"The local competition was obviously there this quarter and has been there for many quarters before. And so the local competition is not new. I think we did really well there. I'm very proud of how weâre doing. I was there right after the launch in October. And the excitement around the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus were absolutely phenomenal. And you can see that in the results with Mainland China being up 100% year-on-year, despite not having a full quarter of sales since we launched in the second half of October.",1
"On iPad, we increased channel inventory by 1.1 million units from beginning of the quarter to end of the quarter. That compares to the previous year where we're increased to 2.1 million. Obviously, that inventory was required because of all the new products that we announced on iPad with the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3 in the October timeframe during the quarter.",1
"From an iPhone point of view, as I think Luca covered, our channel inventory decreased from the beginning of the quarter by 200,000 units, and that left us outside of our target range on the low -- outside the low end of the range to be specific. Just recently we became in supply demand balance on the 6 and 6 Plus in January. We were not able to reach a balanced state during our fiscal Q1.",1
"Okay. And then could you update us in terms of the sell through relative to the reported numbers for the Phone, the Pad and your biggest plans to increase by roughly a week of channel inventory?",1
"Steve, its Tim. We donât report out the precise mix. But what I can tell you is that iPhone 6 was the most popular iPhone last quarter, but I just believe to sell 74.5 million they were really all popular. And all did well. There is clearly a geographic difference where some geos would skew much higher on their preference to iPhone 6 Plus than other geos. And so itâs something that is not consistent around the world. But both did incredibly well, and weâre really proud of them, along with the iPhone 5S and 5C as well, which continues to in the lineup.",1
"I wonder if you could address the mix of the iPhone 6 line. Specifically, how did the 6 Plus do? I donât know if you can give us a sense relative to total units, maybe geographic view, and also availability? Are you calling up on the 6 Plus?",1
From UBS weâll hear from Steve Milunovich.,1
"I think as you know, we prefer to adjust local pricing at the time of new product launches. That will be obviously our preference. Thatâs what we do in normal times. When currencies move as much as they have been in places like Russia for example, sometimes we need to take mid-cycle action to realign pricing. So weâll see what happens. As you know currency markets tend to be very volatile. So we just want to understand a bit better what is happening.",1
"And as a follow-up to that, can you talk a little bit about pricing power? Basically as you think about currency and euro movements and that -- and then the contracts you have with the carriers, can you talk about maybe the opportunities to raise prices, because I know it's something that a lot of companies are balancing right now?",1
"It goes without saying strong U.S. dollar has negative impact on our international business. Having said all that, we have provided what we believe is very strong guidance for the March quarter. We remain very, very confident about the portfolio of products and services that we have in the market today and we remain very, very confident in the pipeline of products and services that we have.",1
"Now having said that, we have factored the impact that I just described into the guidance that we provided to you. So thatâs where we are right now. Of course, as you look further out, you know we do not provide guidance past the March quarter, but it goes without saying that at current levels, again those headwinds will continue to become stronger for the reason I explained earlier, that our hedges continue to expire, they get replaced by new hedging contracts at current levels and so -- and there is the impact that we would see during the course of the year.",1
"What that means to us going forward for the March quarter is that revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in constant currency would be five point higher than what we are guiding to, if it wasnât for the FX movements. In terms of gross margins, and you know that we look our gross margins on a sequential basis, the gross margin percentage after the offset that we're getting from the hedging program will be impacted by over 100 basis points.",1
"On a profitability standpoint, our hedging program partially mitigated the impact from the volatility in currencies. As we look forward, and we look into particularly the March quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds will be stronger in Q2 than they were in Q1 for two main reasons. The first one is the fact that the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate against foreign currencies during the last few weeks. And the other one is the fact that our existing hedges expire. They get replace by new contracts at current levels and therefore the protection that is provided to us by our hedging program diminishes over time.",1
"Yes, Shannon Iâll do that now. Iâll talk about Q1. Iâll talk about what we are looking for Q2 and possibly even further. Obviously, what weâve seen during Q1 has been unprecedented movements in currencies. I would say during the course of the quarter the biggest impact came from the Japanese yen, the Russian rubel, but also from euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar. Our revenue growth during Q1 would have been four percentage points higher on a constant currency basis.",1
Thank you very much and nice iPhone numbers. Can you talk about Luca about currency? How you are thinking about it? What it did this quarter? What it does to gross margin? And whatâs itâs going to do during the year? Because thatâs clearly a big topic of conversation?,1
[Operator Instructions] First weâll hear from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
And we ask that you limit yourself to one part question and one follow-up. Operator may we have the first question please.,1
"We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%, we expect OpEx to be between $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion and we expect OI&E to be about $350 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%. Also today our Board has declared dividend of $0.47 per common share payable on February 12, 2015 to shareholders of record as of February 9, 2015.",1
"Starting with revenue, weâre reporting an all-time record, $88.3 billion, up nearly $10 billion or 13% over the prior record set last year. It is our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. As you know, the December quarter a year ago spanned 14-weeks compared to 13-weeks this year, which is important to consider as we assess the underlying performance of our business this year. When we look at average revenue per week, our growth rate was even higher at 21% with growth across all product categories for the third consecutive quarter.",1
"In Greater China, we were very happy to generate double digit revenue growth for the second quarter in a row and in emerging markets outside of Greater China, we saw 25% year-over-year growth.",1
"And as you know and as you can tell even from our website, most of the iPad and Mac models are constrained today. They've been constrained for several quarters, because the demand is very good for those products. And the Services business as you know is growing double digits. So that's what gives us confidence for the June quarter and going forward.",1
"Yes. Yes, certainly, iPhone was one of the major factors why we exceeded our own internal expectations at the beginning of the quarter. We have a fantastic product lineup and we know that, and it's been fantastic to see the customer response for new models, particularly the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max. So, we've done very, very well both on units and on pricing because of the strong mix.",1
"That's great. And Tim, one of the challenges with valuing Apple is just a limited visibility that investors have into the road map and any new categories that you might enter over time. Without, of course, commenting on any given opportunity, can you talk about the framework that you use internally to evaluate new markets that might be attractive and what you believe will determine your success as you look to enter new markets?",1
"Thanks, Katy, for the question, and thanks for not asking me any specifics. The framework that we use is very much around we ask ourselves if this is a product that we would want to use ourselves or a service that we would want to use ourselves. And that's a pretty high bar. And we ask ourselves if it's a big enough market to be in unless it's an adjacency product, of which we're looking at it very much from a customer experience point of view.",1
"And so there's no set way that we're looking at it, no formula kind of thing. But we're taking into account all of those things, and the kind of things that we love to work on are those where there's a requirement for hardware, software and services to come together because we believe that the magic really occurs at that intersection. And so hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight into how we look at it.",1
"And I think we have some good -- really good opportunities out there. And I think if you look at our current portfolio of products, we still have relatively a low share in a number of cases in very big markets. And so we feel like we have really good upside there, and we feel like we have really good upside in the Services area, too, that we've been working on for quite some time with four or five new services just coming online in the last year, year-plus, and so -- yes. Thank you.",1
We'll hear next from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.,1
"Luca, the iPhone growth exceeded your expectations despite a late launch. Can you maybe share on the unit side or the ASP side? You referred to very strong mix a couple of times on the call. And how does this change your view on the March quarter? And if you could share any color on if you're still supply constrained, and I have a follow-up for Tim.",1
"And we've had some level of supply constraints as we went through the quarter, particularly on the Pro and the Pro Max. As you said correctly, we launched these products in the middle of the quarter, two models after four weeks, the other two models after seven weeks. And so obviously, we had a very steep ramp, which fortunately went very, very well. The products are doing very well all around the world.",1
"And from the FX standpoint, really, at the gross margin level, FX didn't play a role neither sequentially nor on a year-over-year basis for the December quarter, partially because of the hedges that you talked about but also because some currencies are still weaker against the dollar, they're still weaker than a year ago. Look specifically to emerging markets in Latin America, in Russia, in Turkey and so on.",1
"I think you've seen that our performance has been particularly strong in China, where we've seen phenomenal customer response that probably. There was also some level of pent-up demand for 5G iPhones, given that the market is moving very quickly to 5G. And so as we look ahead into the March quarter, we're very optimistic. We believe we're going to be able to be in supply-demand balance for all the models at some point during the quarter. And it's -- the product is doing very well all around the world.",1
"Great. And Tim, you mentioned about the strength of the installed base performance, which continues to grow very impressively at this scale. Can you maybe help us think through how the switcher versus upgrade activity has been tracking in recent quarters? I would love to get your thoughts on that.",1
"Yes. Thanks for the question. If you look at this past quarter, which has -- we started selling two of the iPhones 4 weeks into the quarter and the other two, seven weeks into the quarter. And so I would caution that this is in the early going. But in looking at the iPhone 12 family, we saw both switchers and upgraders increase on a year-over-year basis. And in fact, we saw the largest number of upgraders that we've ever seen in a quarter. And so, we were very thrilled about that.",1
We'll go ahead and take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"Tim, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? Clearly, significant sequential growth, which I think has a lot to do with iPhone. But I'm curious, both from an iPhone as well as your other product categories, what you're seeing and how much back to normal you think the Chinese market is? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"Yes. China was more than an iPhone story. iPhone did do very well there. And sort of like the world, if you look at both switchers and upgraders, we were up year-over-year, and China also had a record number of upgraders during the quarter, the most we've ever seen in a quarter. I think probably some portion of this was that people probably delayed purchasing in the previous quarter as rumors started appearing about an iPhone.",1
"Clearly, if the dollar remains weak or continues to weaken, that can become a tailwind for us as we get into the March quarter. At current rates, we expect some level of benefit around 60 to 70 basis points for the March quarter.",1
"Yes, Katy. So yes, the gross margin was strong, was better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The reason for that was obviously, we had very strong leverage from higher sales. And the mix was strong, both the mix within products and the mix of services, and that was only partially offset by cost. As you know, we've launched many new products during the fall, and that always comes with new cost structures. So in total, it was very good.",1
"The key drivers for our Services growth all continue to move in the right direction: first, our installed base growth has accelerated and each major product category; second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the December quarter, with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments; third, paid subscriptions continue to grow nicely, and we exceeded our target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020.",1
"We're also pleased with the rapid adoption of the Mac Employee Choice Program among the world's leading businesses, who are seeing improved productivity, increased employee satisfaction and talent retention. With the introduction of M1-powered Macs, we're excited to extend these experiences to an even broader range of customers and employees, especially in times of increased remote working.",1
"In payment services, we continue to expand our coverage, with nearly 90% of stores in the United States now accepting Apple Pay so that customers can easily have a touchless payments experience. Wearables, Home and Accessories grew 30% year-over-year to $13 billion, setting new all-time revenue records in every geographic segment. As a result of this strong performance, our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 120 company.",1
"Importantly, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We're very excited about the future of this category and believe that our integration of hardware, software and services uniquely positions us to provide great customer experience in this category.",1
"Next, I'd like to talk about Mac. We set a December quarter record for revenue at $8.7 billion up 21% over last year. We grew strong-double-digits in each geographic segment and set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific as well as December quarter records in the Americas, Greater China and in Japan. This performance was driven by strong demand for the new MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac mini, all powered by our brand-new M1 chip.",1
"iPad performance was also very impressive with revenue of $8.4 billion, up 41%. We grew strong -- very strong double digits in every geographic segment, including an all-time record in Japan. During the quarter, the new -- the all-new iPad Air became available and customer response has been terrific. Both Mac and iPad are incredibly relevant products for our customers in the current working and learning environments. And we are delighted that the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 93% for Mac and 94% for iPad.",1
"With this level of customer satisfaction and with around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter being new to that product, the active installed base for both products continues to grow nicely and reached new all-time highs.",1
"In the enterprise market, we are seeing many businesses shifting their technology investment in response to COVID. One example is our businesses are handling their hundreds of millions of office desk phones while more employees are working remotely. Last quarter, Mitsubishi UFJ Bank, one of the largest banks in the world, announced that it will be replacing 75% of its fixed phones with iPhones. By doing so, it expects to realize significant cost savings while providing a secure mobile platform to employees.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $196 billion in cash plus marketable securities and retired $1 billion of maturing debt, leaving us with total debt of $112 billion. As a result, net cash was $84 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned over $30 billion to shareholders during the December quarter, including $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $24 billion through open market repurchases of 200 million Apple shares as we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time.",1
"Congratulations on a really strong quarter. First question for Luca. The gross margin was particularly strong versus your outlook. Can you talk about whether you recognize the full impact of the weaker dollar in the December quarter, given your typical currency hedges? And then how are you thinking about the headwinds and tailwinds on gross margins as you go into the March quarter? And then I have a follow-up for Tim.",1
"As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we will not be guiding to a specific revenue range. However, we are providing some directional insights, assuming that COVID-related impacts of our business do not worsen from our current assumptions for the quarter.",1
"For total company revenue, we believe growth will accelerate on a year-over-year basis, and in aggregate, follow typical seasonality on a sequential basis. At the product category level, keep in mind two items: first, during the March quarter last year, we saw elevated activity in our digital services as lockdowns occurred around the world, so our Services business faces a tougher year-over-year comparison; second, we believe the year-over-year growth in the Wearables, Home and Accessories category will decelerate compared to Q1.",1
"As you know, we were chasing demand on AirPods last year as we expanded channel inventory from Q1 to Q2. This year, we plan to decrease AirPods channel inventory as is typical after the holiday quarter.",1
"We expect gross margin to be similar to the December quarter. We expect OpEx to be between $10.7 billion and $10.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be up around $50 million and our tax rate to be around 17%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of common stock payable on February 11, 2021, to shareholders of record as of February 8, 2021.",1
A - Tejas Gala,1
We'll go question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.,1
"Keep in mind that 5G in China is -- the network is well established. And the overwhelming majority of phones being sold are 5G phones. And so I think there was some level of anticipation for us delivering an iPhone with 5G. And so, iPhone did extremely well.",1
"However, the other products did as well. I mean, we could not have turned in a performance like we did with only iPhone. iPad did extremely well, far beyond the Company average. Mac was about the Company average. Wearables, Home and Accessories was above the Company average. And so if you really look at it, we did really well across the Board there.",1
"In terms of COVID, I think they're -- at least for last quarter, they were beat -- sort of beyond COVID, very much in the recovery stage. This quarter, there are different reports about some cases in some places and lockdowns occurring but we have not seen that in our business as yet. Of course, those cases are much smaller than the ones in other countries.",1
"If you look at Mac, the M1, I think, gives us a new growth trajectory that we haven't had in the past. Certainly, if Q1 is a good proxy, there's lots of excitement about M1-based Macs. As you know, we're partly through the transition. We've got more -- a lot more to do there. We're early days of a two-year transition, but we're excited about what we see so far.",1
"I have two questions as well. I guess, starting with you, Luca, I just wanted to go back to the gross margin discussion, and we really haven't seen gross margins at this level, high 39%, I think, since 2016. Could you maybe step back and talk, what has enabled the shift higher? What are the key drivers to get you there? And is commodity tailwind or in-sourcing of some components really a big part of this? So just love to understand the durability of the gross margin at these levels. And what are the big drivers that got us here?",1
"Well, I mean, of course, when you grow the way we've grown this quarter, 21%, it's -- obviously, we have a certain level of fixed cost in our product structures, right? And so a high level of sales helps margin expansion without a doubt, and so that has been probably the biggest factor, to be honest.",1
"And then as I was saying earlier, we've had, across the Board, in Services, in every product category, we've had a very strong mix of products, right? We were talking about the iPhone, the Pro and the Pro Max, and that's been pretty much the case in every product category. So the mix has also been very good. The commodity environment is fairly benign.",1
"And the one thing that has not affected us this time around is the FX that it's true, it has not been a tailwind yet for the reasons that I was explaining to Katy, but at the same time, it has not been a negative. And the reality is that FX for us has been a negative over the last five or six years, almost every quarter. And so that has changed. And that obviously makes a difference.",1
"And then Tim and when I look at the growth rates on Mac and iPads, they've been in the 20% to 40% range for the last three quarters, and I suspect some of this is just folks contending with the pandemic. But love to understand, when you look at these growth rates, how much of this do you think is replacement cycle-driven folks upgrading with at home versus new customers and new folks that are coming into the Apple ecosystem? And do you see, I guess, what sort of growth rates do you think is more durable or predictable as we go forward over here?",1
"If you look at the switcher or the switchers, if you look at the new to Mac and new to iPad, these numbers are still about, at a worldwide level, about half of the purchases that are coming from people that are new. And so the installed base is still expanding with new customers in it. And so that's true on both iPad and Mac.",1
"The iPad, as we went out with the iPad Air, and we now have the best iPad lineup we've ever had, and it's clear that some people are using these as laptop replacements. Others are using them as complementary to their desktop. But the level of growth there has been phenomenal. You look at it at 41%. And yes, part of it is work from home and part of it is just learning.",1
"Right. I guess the other thing I was curious about, with regard to the Services business, if we could dig a little bit more, I think this is one of the first times when Luca, you talked about Apple TV+, Arcade, Apple Pay, some of the smaller services actually kind of moving the needle. And then I was also curious, you had a number of stores closed at least later in the quarter, and that typically has impacted some of your AppleCare revenue and yet you outperformed. So, maybe if you could talk about a bit more about the drivers of the Services revenue?",1
"But I think I wouldn't underestimate how much of it is the product itself on -- in both the case of iPad and Mac. And of course, our share in the Mac is quite low. In the -- for the total personal computer market. And so there's lots of headroom there.",1
We'll go ahead and take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.,1
"Congrats on the record quarter from my side as well. I guess I wanted to start off with iPhone sales. I think in -- general impression we have is China and North America have more robust 5G infrastructure. I just wanted to see kind of what are you seeing in terms of customer engagement or velocity of sales for iPhone in Europe, where I think the general impression is that service providers haven't rolled out robust 5G services. Is that something that's impacting customer interest in the latest lineup in the region? And I have a follow-up.",1
"If you look at the 5G rollout in Europe, it's true that Europe is not in the place of -- certainly nowhere close to where China is and nowhere close to the U.S. either. But there are other regions that 5G is -- that has very good coverage, like Korea is an example. And so the the world, I would describe it right now, is more of a patchwork more to do that we haven't had in quilt.",1
There are places that there's really excellent coverage. There are places where -- within a country that is very good but not from a nationwide point of view. And then there are places that really haven't gotten started yet. Latin America is more closer to the last one. There's lots of opportunity ahead of us there. And I think Europe is where there are 5G implementations there. I think most of that growth is probably in front of us there as well.,1
"Got it. As a follow-up, if I can just ask you, I think you mentioned the momentum you're seeing for the Apple One bundle, which I think has been a couple of months now since you launched it. Any metrics to share in terms of what you're seeing for conversion rate of customers or even insights into which services are turning in that bundle, are turning out to be the anchor Services that's driving adoption of that bundle?",1
We'll hear from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.,1
"And then, of course, we've got new things that we're not going to talk about that we think will contribute to the Company as well, just like other new things have contributed nicely to the Company in the past. So, we see lots of opportunity. Thank you for the question.",1
"And of course, the other thing from a market point of view is we're -- we've been on a multiyear effort in the enterprise and have gained quite a bit of traction there. You've heard some of the things in Luca's comments today and we comment some on it each quarter. We're very optimistic about what we can do in that space.",1
"Like if you take India as an example, we doubled our business last quarter compared to the year ago quarter. But our absolute level of business there is still quite low relative to the size of the opportunity. And you can kind of take that and go around the world and find other markets that are like that as well.",1
"And on the Wearables side, we've brought this thing from zero to a Fortune 120 company, which was no small feat. But I still think that we're in the early stages of those products. If you look at our share in some of the other products, whether you look in iPhone or Mac or iPad, you find that the share numbers leave a fair amount of headroom for market share expansion. And this is particularly the case in some of the emerging markets, where we're proud of how we've done but there's a lot more headroom in those markets.",1
"We have an installed base that has hit new highs that we just talked about earlier in our opening comments. And we're still attracting a fair number of switchers and, of course, upgraders. We just set an all-time Services record, and we have that installed base to compound that, and particularly with the added services that we've had over the last year or so, that as they grow and mature, will contribute even more to the Services revenue stream.",1
"Yes. Toni, as you know, we give some color on the current quarter but not beyond that in terms of growth rates, so I'll punt that part of your question. But if you back up and look at the sort of the ingredients that we have at this point, we have the strongest hardware portfolio that we've ever had. And we have a great product pipeline for the future, both in products and in Services.",1
"Okay. And then, Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment more broadly around growth for Apple and sources of growth. The Company this year is going to be well over $300 billion in revenue. Historically, you've issued acquisitions. And I'm wondering if you could comment whether you still feel confident that Apple has Apple organic growth opportunities and that you don't believe acquisitions are an important source of growth? And then I think perhaps most importantly, as you look out, let's say, over the next five years, what do you think is a realistic revenue growth rate for Apple going forward?",1
"And we mentioned a couple of product categories, Services and Wearables, where we're going to be having a slightly more difficult compare. And so I think you can draw your conclusions around the iPhone.",1
"In terms of the sequential change, we talked about -- during the prepared remarks, we talked about total company average, and we said that we expect that sequential progression to be similar to the typical seasonality that you've seen in past years. Certainly, last year is not typical because of COVID. But if you go back, fiscal '17, '18, '19, that's our typical seasonal progression.",1
"At the end of the quarter, the demand has been very strong. And so we've been constrained, as I said, on -- especially in the Pro models. At the end of December, we exited with a level of iPhone channel inventory, which was slightly below a year ago. So we -- and we still had some level of supply constraints, which we believe we're going to be able to solve during the March quarter.",1
"So on the December performance, as you know, Toni, this was a very different cycle because we launched at a different time than usual. And so, we had an initial part of the quarter where, obviously, we didn't have the new phones. And then as we launched the new phones, we also did the channel fill that typically happens, to a certain extent, in the September quarter.",1
"I also have one for Luca and one for Tim. Luca, I was wondering if we could just probe a little bit more into iPhone. Maybe you can just -- you talked about a drawdown in channel inventory last quarter. Our iPhone channel inventory is sort of at normal levels now exiting Q1. And should we be thinking about above-seasonal iPhone growth, given that you're still not in supply-demand balance and you had fewer selling days in fiscal Q1? Should we be thinking about sort of above-seasonal iPhone growth looking into Q2?",1
We'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.,1
"And we also saw a sequential acceleration in advertising and so that also helped the overall growth rate. Clearly, the strength was in digital services, in the App Store, in cloud services, in Music. Those were the services that really delivered very, very strong performance. It's something that we've seen happen during the COVID environment.",1
"What happened during the December quarter is that in-store traffic improved. And so AppleCare, we grew -- we didn't grow as much as company average but we grew in AppleCare, set an all-time record there in spite of the fact that, yes, we are running, particularly in December, we started closing a few stores, particularly here in the United States but also in Western Europe. But in total, we were able to support more customers than in past quarters.",1
"Yes. I mean, really, it's been strong across the Board. There are two businesses during COVID that have been impacted negatively, and then we talked about it in the past. One is AppleCare. Obviously, when the stores are closed, it's tougher, of course, for customers to have the interaction with us. And advertising, which is -- it's in line with the overall level of economic activity.",1
"During the December quarter, we added more than 35 million sequentially, and we now have more than 620 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 140 million from just a year ago. Finally, we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current Services offerings and are adding new services that we think our customers will love. For example, Apple Music recently released its biggest product update ever with features like Listen Now, all new Search, personal radio stations and auto play. 90% of Apple Music users on iOS 14 have already used these new features.",1
"Turning to Services. As I said, we reached an all-time revenue record of $15.8 billion and set all-time records in App Store, cloud services, Music, advertising, AppleCare and payment services. Our new service offerings, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ as well as the Apple One bundle are also contributing to overall Services growth and continue to add users, content and features.",1
We'll hear from Krish Sankar with Cowen.,1
"Yes. And I think that the mix helped us both in Q1 and itâs helping us with the guidance for Q2. And as you said, some of it is mix of iPhones. The customer response for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max is being exceptional. And that clearly has helped our mix. iPhone 11 was our top selling model throughout the quarter, every single week of the quarter. And so certainly, better mix within iPhone. The other point that I would like to point out is that as we move from Q1 to Q2, the proportion of revenue coming from services increases versus the holiday quarter. And given that fact that services are accretive to gross margin for the Company, we end up getting a better mix from services as well.",1
"Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So, slightly different take on an earlier question on Wearables, and that is, what impact you think Wearables is driving people into the Apple ecosystem? You mentioned 75% watch buyers are new to the Apple Watch, but are many of them new to Apple overall? I'm sure a lot of existing iPhone, iPads or Mac users are going to Wearables customers, but do you think Wearables bring people into the ecosystem to buy other devices in a material way?",1
"I think that -- Mike, itâs Tim. With each Apple product that a customer buys, I think, they get tighter into the ecosystem because they like -- that's the reason that they're buying into it, is they like the experience, the customer experience. And so from that point of view, I think each of our products can drive another product. I would think, in that case itâs more likely that the iPhone comes first, but there's no doubt in my mind that there's some people that came into the ecosystem for the Watch.",1
"Okay. And then, I think you recently mentioned that augmented reality will pervade our entire lives. And I'm wondering if you could share your thoughts about how you think it starts to impact our lives most significantly. For example, will the inflection point in AR come from gaming or industrial usage or some other category? In other words, where will the average person kind of first feel that impact of AR on their lives in a significant way? Thanks.",1
"I think, when you look at AR today, you would see that there are consumer applications, there are enterprise applications. This is the reason I'm so excited about it is, you rarely have a new technology where business and consumer are both see it as key to them. And so, I think, the answer is --- that's the reason, I think itâs going to pervade your lives is because itâs going to go across business and your home life. I think, these things will happen in parallel. There are already companies that are deep into enterprise business that are working on applications for the enterprise. And of course you can see -- you go on to store, see thousands of apps that are AR kit enabled at this time and would even more coming.",1
"That will come from Raymond James, Chris Caso.",1
"Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess, the first question is on gross margins. And you spoke about the favorable mix. Wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. And clearly, iPhone is doing well within the overall mix that growing year-on-year. But, if you could talk about what's happening to the mix within iPhone, is that improving as well and also helping margins? And is there anything else you would point to with regard to the overall mix in margins?",1
"Okay. Thank you. And I guess, follow-on question with regard to OpEx. And it has been growing at a faster rate than revenue for I guess largely over the last three years or so. Can you set us some expectation with regard to when you get a return on that investment? I understand there are new investments that are happening now. But, how should we think about potential leverage going forward? Is there a point in time where the OpEx spending tend to level off and you get some return on that or is it just the function of a faster revenue growth in future?",1
"Yes. I think we felt good about our OpEx results, because they were at the low end of our guidance range. But clearly, we want to make all the necessary investments in the business. And in terms of the new services, not only for TV+ but all the new services that we launched during 2019, this is period where weâre making the necessary investments in advertising and marketing, and that level of investment is reflected in our OpEx results. And also, as you correctly stated, we completed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business unit in December quarter. And so, we had -- we reflected the run rate of the expenses related to that business, partially during the quarter, after the completion of the transaction. And that is a very important core technology for the Company. So, we will continue to make all the necessary investments also there. There is a third category of expenses that affected the December quarter, and itâs a fact that our revenue was very strong, and we have certain valuable expenses. For example, credit card fees that are associated with the higher volume and of course impacted our OpEx results.",1
"Well, I would start by saying that our expense to revenue ratio is incredibly competitive relative to other companies in our sector. There are years when our OpEx grows faster than our revenue but we also had years in the recent past where the opposite has happened. We continue to believe that we have a lot of great opportunities in front of us. And just if you look this past year, we launched many new initiatives, for example, on the services front, which we want to support with the appropriate level of investment, and not only marketing and advertising but also in R&D.",1
"As I mentioned earlier, we closed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business because we think itâs a very important strategic core technology for the Company going forward. And I think from the results that youâve seen during this quarter and the guidance that we provided for the March quarter, I think weâre doing a pretty good job of balancing the level of investments that weâre making on the expense front, with the level of returns that we get both in terms of revenue and in terms of profitability that weâre getting. Our net income for example was up 11% during the December quarter.",1
That will come from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.,1
"I just wanted to kind of ask on the iPhone revenue growth, definitely good to see return to growth. Based on the velocity and momentum youâre seeing for the products exiting the quarter, how comfortable are you feeling about sustaining growth in iPhone revenues through year? And I have a follow-up.",1
"We have a practice of forecasting the current quarter. And so, weâve given you the range that we expect for the current quarter and really don't give a range beyond that.",1
"Okay. So, if I can just maybe then follow up in terms of -- obviously, youâve returned to growth in most of the regions you report. One of the regions that are declining is Japan. So, if you can share your thoughts on what actions you need to take there to return that segment and that geography to grow? And what are the product trends there and what's probably the headwind that's kind of limiting growth there?",1
That will be from Mike Olson with Piper Sandler.,1
"And then, a follow-up for Luca. OpEx as a percentage of sales for March looks like e about 15% higher than in your prior quarters. Kind of curious how much of that is -- part of it is driven by some of your Intel modem asset purchases or TV+ in the OpEx or how do we think about it on a go forward basis?",1
"Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high and has now surpassed 1 billion devices, thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 12 family.",1
"Hi. Thank you. Tim, Apple has a very valuable installed base of users. Can you see a future where Apple can become larger in the advertising market, as you build out TV+, given you could have the unique position and ability to drive targeted ads to users without compromising on privacy?",1
"So, we were seeing some signs of new spectrum being deployed for 5G deployments and even additional 4G capacity, and itâs already having a positive impact for handset upgrades to use that new capacity? Do you get the sense that wireless carriers are getting more incentivize to upgrade handsets to get a leverage out of these new network investments? How much might this be helping, and do you think it will continue to accelerate?",1
"I think that weâve had some great partners, not only in the U.S. but also around the world that are really helpful this quarter, as partners. And so, I think that probably a part of that is the level of investments they have. And then, a part of it is probably making sure that those customer stick with them in a environment where there's a lot of trading back and forth. So, I am optimistic that it will continue.",1
"Okay, great. And then, the comment that you made about capacity in the Wearables division with AirPods Pro and Apple Watch 3, what should we think about the timeline of when those capacity constraints might be alleviated? And will they come from capacity additions or the natural workout of unit shipments and something on the demand side?",1
"I'm hopeful that the Series 3 will come in to balance during this quarter. On AirPods Pro, I don't have estimate for that for you. I just can't predict when at this point. We seem to be fairly substantially off their and we're working very hard to put in additional capacity.",1
"Thanks, Kyle. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"Yes. Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America.",1
"I think, it is possible to have advertising in a straightforward manner that doesnât encroach on people's privacy. I wouldnât want to conjecture about us in that business. I think for the TV+ business, we feel strongly that what the customer wants is an add-free product, and so that's not our aversion to ads, itâs what we believe that a customer wants.",1
"Again, Iâm going to stay away from commenting about future products. But, generally, I think itâs important when you think about 5G is to look around the world at the different deployment schedules. And some of those look very different perhaps than what you might be seen here. And so, thatâs very important. In terms of the price, I wouldnât want to comment on the price of handsets that arenât announced.",1
"Okay. Thank you. And Luca, can you just clarify if the services revenue this quarter had any impact of deferrals associated with TV+ at all? And how can you help us maybe size the impact of the amortization of the content costs associated with TV+ as we think about the next couple of years? Thank you.",1
"Yes. So, yes. Of course, we launched the service and so there was a very small contribution to revenue from the deferral, and there was also contribution to revenue from the people, the subscribers that are actually paying for the service. When you think about what goes into the Apple TV+ revenue, at this point, there are two components. There is paid subscribers, these are the customers that pay for the service and we recognize revenue over the subscription period. And then, we got the what we call the Apple TV+ bundle subscribers. These are the customers that buy an eligible hardware device and redeem the offer for a three-year of TV+ services. We deferred revenue for this offer, based on three items, the first one is the value of the service that is being provided, the one year of Apple TV+. The second one is the number of customers that are eligible for the offer. And the third one is our estimate of the expected number of customers that will redeem the offer. So, you need to keep in mind that from our total eligible device sales, you need to make a number of reductions for family sharing, for multiple device purchases and for geographic availability.",1
"Also, the take rate can also be impacted by the availability of local content, and we also require a payment method on file. So, this estimate is reviewed quarterly and gets updated based on actual trends of the offer. So, these inputs provide us with the amount of revenue that we deferred for each device sale that then gets recognized over the one-year period that the TV plus service has provided. So, when you take the combination of paid subscribers and bundled subscribers, you get the Apple TV+ revenue. Of course because weâve launched the service very recently, the amount of revenue that we recognized during the quarter, was immaterial to our results.",1
"With regard to the cost of developing the content, we -- essentially as we incur these costs, we put them on the balance sheet and then we amortize over a certain period of time depending on the type of content that we produce.",1
Weâll hear from Cowen and Company's Krish Sankar.,1
"I had two questions. First one, Tim, I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit on the overall smartphone market. There is a general view that when 5G phones come out theyâre going to be more expensive due to higher component costs, but at the same time, it looks like you guys have proven that there is a market for low cost geographies to phones like iPhone SE. So, how do you see these two different segments within the smart phone market evolving over the next one to three years? And then, I had a follow-up for Luca.",1
"Yes. So, Japan was down 10% during the December quarter. It was primarily due to iPhone performance, which was challenged because there were some regulatory changes that took effect on the 1st of October where essentially the regulators decoupled the mobile phone pricing from the two-year contract and are capping the maximum amount of carrier discounts that can be made. At the same time, I would say, within a more difficult macro environment, iPhone did incredibly well during the quarter, six of the top seven selling smart models in Japan during the December quarter were iPhones. So, it was very strong performance by iPhone in a difficult environment. Also, in Japan, we had very strong double-digit growth from services, stronger than Company average; and very strong double-digit growth in Wearables, also stronger than Company average. So, we feel very good. Japan is a country where historically weâve had great success. The customers are very loyal and very engaged and we have very strong position there, we feel we have a very good momentum.",1
"Thank you, Samik. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414. Financial analysts can contact me with additional questions at 669-227-2402. Thank you again for joining us.",1
"Again, that will conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation.",1
"At Apple, we have every intention to be partners in this effort, and we look forward to working in communities around the world to make it possible. And as this chapter of uncertainty continues, so will our tireless work to help our customers stay safe, connected and well.",1
"And our new Apple Developer Academy in Downtown Detroit will be the first of its kind in the United States. Detroit has a vibrant culture of black entrepreneurship, including over 50,000 black-owned businesses. We want to accelerate the potential of the app economy here, knowing there is no shortage of good ideas in such a creative, resilient and dedicated community.",1
"Finally, we're committing $35 million across two investments in Harlem Capital and the Clear Vision Impact Fund that support, accelerate and grow minority-owned businesses in areas of great potential and need. In December, we concluded an unmatched year of giving.",1
"Since the inception of the Apple Giving Program in 2011, Apple employees have donated nearly $600 million and volunteered more than 1.6 million hours to over 34,000 organizations of every stride. Through our partnership with Product Red, we've adapted our 14-year $250 million effort to support HIV and AIDS work globally to ensure that care of COVID. That includes delivering millions of units of personal protective equipment to health care providers in Zambia.",1
"And here in the United States, even with COVID's effects, we are ahead of schedule on our multiyear commitment to invest $350 billion throughout the American economy. As proud as this makes us, we know there is much more to be done. Looking forward, we continue to contend with the COVID-19 pandemic but we must also now work to imagine what we will inherit on the other side.",1
"When a disease recedes, we cannot simply assume that healing follows. Even now, we see the deep scars that this period has left in our communities. Trust has been compromised, opportunities have been lost, entire portions of our lives that we took for granted, schools for children, meetings with our colleagues, small businesses that have endured for generations have simply disappeared.",1
"It will take a society-wide effort across the public and private sectors as individuals and communities, every one of us, to ensure that what's ahead of us is not simply the end of a disease, but the beginning of something durable and hopeful for those who gave, suffered and endured during this time.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We started our fiscal 2021 with exceptional business and financial performance during the December quarter, as we set all-time records for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share and operating cash flow. We are thrilled with the way our teams continued to innovate and execute throughout this period of elevated uncertainty.",1
"Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q1 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.",1
"Our revenue reached an all-time record of $111.4 billion, an increase of nearly $20 billion or 21% from a year ago. We grew strong double digits in each of our product categories, with all-time records for iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and services as well as a December quarter record for Mac. We also achieved double-digit growth and new all-time records in each of our five geographic segments and in the vast majority of countries that we track.",1
"Products revenue was an all-time record of $95.7 billion, up 21% over a year ago. As a consequence of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices passed 1.65 billion during the December quarter and reached an all-time record in each of our major product categories.",1
"Our Services set an all-time record of $15.8 billion, growing 24% year-over-year. We established new all-time records in most service categories and December quarter records in each geographic segment. I'll cover our Services business in more detail later. Company gross margin was 39.8%, up 160 basis points sequentially, thanks to leverage from higher sales and a strong mix.",1
"Products gross margin was 35.1%, growing 530 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and mix. Services gross margin was 68.4%, up 150 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix.",1
"Net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow were all-time records. Net income was $28.8 billion, up $6.5 billion or 29% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.68, up 35% over last year and operating cash flow was $38.8 billion, an improvement of $8.2 billion.",1
"Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was a record $65.6 billion, growing 17% year-over-year as demand for the iPhone 12 family was very strong despite COVID-19 and social distancing measures, which have impacted store operations in a significant manner.",1
"The Propel Center, launched with a $25 million commitment and with the support of historically black colleges and universities across the country, will help support the next-generation of leaders in fields ranging from machine learning to app development to entrepreneurship and design.",1
"In our communities, we see how every burden from COVID-19, to the resulting economic challenges, to the closure of in-person learning for students, falls heaviest on those who have always faced structural barriers to opportunity and equality. This month, Apple announced major new commitments through a $100 million Racial Equity & Justice Initiative.",1
"Particularly, after the events of the last few weeks, we are focused on how we can help a moment of great national need. Because none of us should have any illusions about the challenges we face as we began a new chapter in the American story. Hope for healing, for unity and for progress begins with and depends on addressing the things that continue to wound us.",1
"The winter holiday season is always a busy times for us and our products, but this year was unique. We had a record number of device activations during the last week of the quarter. And as COVID-19 kept us apart, we saw the highest volume of FaceTime calls ever this Christmas. As always, we could not have made so many holidays special without our talented and dedicated retail teams who helped us achieve a new all-time revenue record for retail, driven by very strong performance in our online store.",1
"Tomorrow is International Privacy Day, and we continue to set new standards to protect users' right to privacy, not just for our own products but to be the ripple in the pond that moves the whole industry forward. Most recently, we're in the process of deploying new requirements across the App Store ecosystem that give users more knowledge about and new tools to control the ways that apps gather and share their personal data.",1
The App Store Small Business Program reduces the commission on the sale of digital goods and services to 15% for small businesses earning less than $1 million a year. The program launched on January 1st and we are already hearing from developers about how this change represents a transformation in their potential to create and grow on the App Store.,1
"The App Store ecosystem has been so important as individuals, families and businesses worldwide evolve and adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we want to make sure that this unrivaled engine of innovation and opportunity continues. This quarter, we also took a significant new step to help smaller developers continue to experiment, innovate and scale the latest great app ideas.",1
"This deep integration of hardware, software and services, have always defined our approach here, and it has delivered an all-time quarterly Services record of $15.8 billion. This was the first quarter of the Apple One bundle, which brings together many of our great services into an easy subscription and with new content being added to these services every day, we feel very optimistic about where we are headed.",1
"Look no further than the great potential of Fitness+, which pairs with Apple Watch to deliver real-time on-screen fitness data alongside world-class workouts by the world's best trainers. There are new sessions added each week, and customers are loving the flexibility, challenge and fun of these classes as well as how the pairing with Apple Watch pushes you to achieve your fitness goals.",1
"Wearables, Home and Accessories grew by 30% year-over-year, driven by significant holiday demand for the latest Apple Watch, our entire AirPods lineup, including the new AirPods Max as well as the new HomePod mini. This broad strength across the category led to new revenue records for each of its three subgroups, and we're very excited about the road ahead for these products.",1
"We have also continued our efforts to bring the latest iPads, enriching content and professional support to educators, students and parents. Educational districts and governments worldwide are continuing major deployments, including the largest iPad deployments ever to schools in Germany and Japan.",1
"iPad and Mac grew by 41% and 21%, respectively, reflecting the continuing role these devices have played in our users' lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this quarter, availability began for both our new iPad Air as well as the first generation of Macs to feature our groundbreaking M1 chip. The demand for all of these products has been very strong.",1
"Let's get started with hardware. We hit a new high watermark for our installed base of active devices, with growth accelerating as we passed 1.65 billion devices worldwide during the December quarter. iPhone grew by 17% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for the iPhone 12 family, and our active installed base of iPhones is now over 1 billion. The customer response to the new iPhone 12 models' unprecedented innovation from world-class cameras to the great and growing potential of 5G has been enthusiastic, even in light of the ongoing COVID-19 impact at retail locations.",1
"While these results show the central role that our products played in helping our users respond to these challenges, we are doubly aware that the work ahead of all of us to navigate the end of this pandemic, to restore normal life and prosperity in our neighborhoods and local economies and, to build back with a sense of justice is profound and urgent. We will speak to these needs and Apple's efforts throughout today's call, but I want to first offer the context of a detailed look at our results this quarter, including why we outperformed our expectations.",1
"It is not far from many of our minds that this result caps off the most challenging year any of us can remember. And it is an understatement to say that the challenges it posed to Apple as a business paled in comparison to the challenge it posed to Apple as a community of individuals, to employees, to their families and to the communities we live in and love to call home.",1
"Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. It's with great gratitude for the tireless and innovative work of every Apple team member worldwide that I share the results of a very strong quarter for Apple. We achieved an all-time revenue record of $111.4 billion. We saw strong double-digit growth across every product category, and we achieved all-time revenue records in each of our geographic segments.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"It's really too early to answer some of those questions. As you know, we just got started into the quarter in Q1 so we have less than a quarter on this right now. What we wanted to accomplish with it, we're clearly accomplishing, which is making our Services very easy to subscribe to. Our customers clearly told us that they wanted to subscribe to several services or, in some cases, all of our services. And so, we've made that very simple, and it's clear from the early going that it's working but we've just gotten started on it.",1
"Congrats on the very strong results. My first question is for Tim. Tim, I want to talk a little bit about your search and advertising business. How do you think of the long-term growth opportunities in advertising? How do you think it -- how long can it grow at two times to three times the App Store growth rate? And also, are there any applications where your fundamental search technology, AI could be adapted for other parts of the Services business, that's the first question. And then I have a quick follow-up for Luca after that.",1
"Gross margin was 38.4% at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 29.8% of revenue. Our net income was $20.1 billion an all-time record, and up $2.2 billion over the last year. Diluted earnings per share were $3.89 also an all-time record and cash flow from operations was very strong of $28.3 billion.",1
"So first question just as it relates to some of the disruption you've seen on the component side, manufacturing and logistics over the past couple of years, are you starting to rethink your broader supply chain strategy or the manufacturing footprint on the back of the significant disruption? Are you happy with the overall geographic exposure that you see in the supply chain today?",1
"Yes. Shannon, thank you for the question. Mac set an all-time revenue record at $10.9 billion for the quarter. That was up 25%. And as you point out, the last 6 quarters for the Mac have been the top 6 revenue quarters of all time. And what's further very good about this is we set all-time revenue records in Americas, in Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific. And we set a December quarter record in Greater China. And so it's not narrowed to a particular geographic area that we're doing well in. It's almost -- about almost across the board.",1
"The response is very much because of M1. And we got even more response with the MacBook Pro that we launched in the -- during the Q1 time frame. The -- both the upgraders, which we had a record number of upgraders for the December quarter, but also in markets like China, 6 out of 10 sales are people new to the Mac. And so it's powered by both upgraders and switchers.",1
"Customer satisfaction is off the charts. And so what I see this as is a -- that will -- a product that will be very successful in a number of different markets from education, to business, to the creative industry and in all geographic markets. We're not limiting ourselves.",1
"Great. And then, Luca, can you talk a bit more on services? Just obviously outperformed your guidance or your expectations as well as certainly where we were at. Where were the -- what were the things that really outperformed? And maybe what trends are you seeing that is driving the extra revenue?",1
"Yes, Shannon. It was -- I mean it was really great on all fronts. We said December quarter records in every geographic segment. And then as I mentioned earlier, an all-time record for cloud, for music, for video, for advertising, for payment services. December quarter record in the App Store. So we've done, as you said, better than we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. This overperformance has been spread around the world and spread around our services categories. And the reality is this combination of factors, the fact that the installed base is growing, the fact that we continue to have more and more engagement of our customers on all the services -- paid subscriptions is a phenomenal story, right? We now have 785 million paid subs. We just -- we've increased 165 million in the last 12 months alone, right? And so all these things combined are really powering the business. Very, very pleased with the performance.",1
We'll hear next from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Katy, if you sort of step back and look at how we've done, our largest issue by far has been the chip shortage. That is industry-wide and on these legacy nodes, as I had mentioned earlier. And I think our supply chain actually does very good considering the shortages because it's a fast-moving supply chain. The cycle times are very short. There's very little distance between a chip being fabricated and packaged and a product being -- going out of factory. And so, no, I don't see that it makes a fundamental change in the supply chain.",1
We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
Okay. And how are you thinking about the metaverse opportunity and Apple's role in that market?,1
"Well, that's a big question. But we're a company in the business of innovation. So we're always exploring new and emerging technologies. And I -- you've spoken at length about how this area is very interesting to us. Right now, we have over 14,000 AR kit apps in the App Store, which provide incredible AR experiences for millions of people today. And so we see a lot of potential in this space and are investing accordingly.",1
We'll take our next question from Amit Daryani with Evercore.,1
"I have 2 as well. I guess both up on the supply chain side, I think these continue to be fairly volatile. I'd love to get your perspective, if you feel, if things or supply chain issues are starting to alleviate or they still remain challenging? And then maybe I missed this, but could you perhaps tell us how much revenue was left on the table in December because of the supply chain issues? And how does that number shake up in March?",1
"Yes. Amit, what we've said in terms of December and March was that it's very difficult to estimate with great precision the constraints. But we said that they would be more than the Q4 or more than the September quarter, and we're saying that March will be less than the December quarter. And so that's the kind of verbiage that weâve placed around it.",1
"In terms of is it still challenging? Yes, it is challenging. And for us, we pride ourselves on getting products to customers who really want them and try to do that in a fast basis. And so it's frustrating that we can't always do that at the speed that we would like. However, March is better than December. And so there's some encouraging sign there. We're not predicting, [which we do not know] overall, obviously because of the number of variables that go into such a prediction.",1
"Tim, could you talk a bit about the Mac business? Looking back, it's up about 50% from the calendar 2019 revenue. You did almost $11 billion this quarter, and you're still working through the M1 transition. So can you talk about where you see the opportunity to gain share? What are really sort of the target markets that you think you can go after in order to grow this beyond think it was about $37 billion in the last 12 months? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"Yes. The issue with iPad, and it was a very significant constraint in the December quarter, was very much on these legacy nodes that I had talked about. Virtually all of the problem was in that area. And so overall, we're not guiding by product constraint -- by product level. But at the -- but overall, we do see an improvement in the March quarter in terms of the constraints going down versus what they were in the December quarter.",1
"As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.",1
"Yes. Thank you. Your margins have clearly been very impressive. So I have one question each on product and one on services gross margins. On product gross margins, that's clearly benefiting from a very strong mix. So Tim, I'm curious how sustainable do you think these mix trends are from the data that you see? And can you share any thoughts across how the Pro and Pro Max mix compared to prior cycles?",1
"Second, we expect foreign exchange to be a 3-point headwind when compared to the December quarter growth rate. We currently expect FX to have a negative impact on growth of 2 points in the March quarter, while it represented a 1 point benefit during the December quarter.",1
"Specifically related to Services, we expect to grow strong double digits but decelerate from the December quarter performance. This is due to a more challenging compare because a higher level of lockdowns around the world last year led to increased usage of digital content and services.",1
"We expect gross margin to be between 42.5% and 43.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $12.5 billion and $12.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $150 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%.",1
"Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on February 10, 2022, to shareholders of record as of February 7, 2022.",1
"And with that, let's open the call to questions.",1
"Absolutely. We'll take our first question from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Hearing no response, we'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.",1
"And on the services side, if I could just ask that, too. When you look at the gross margins there, that's been really impressive. Can you give us some sense of where within services, you're seeing particularly favorable mix trends? And how should investors think about the trajectory of these margins given some of the sizable investments you're making to drive very successful areas like content for TV+ as an example?",1
Okay. Great. Can you give us any other color on kind of the trajectory of iPad and what's impacting this quarter and where it might go in the March and the June quarter?,1
"Wamsi, it's Tim. In terms of the mix, we don't comment directly on mix. But what I would tell you is that we saw strong demand across the iPhone 13 family. And in fact, we had several of the top-selling models in various markets, including the top 5 in the U.S. and Australia, the top 4 in Urban China, 2 of the top 3 in the UK, 3 of the top 4 in France and Germany and 4 of the top 6 in Japan. And certainly, based on some external data that I've seen, it does seem to say that we are gaining share as well. So we feel quite good about the momentum of iPhone. And I should add that we were constrained during the quarter.",1
"Wamsi, on the services side, you were asking about gross margin there. As you know, our services business in aggregate is accretive to overall company margin. And as you know, our services portfolio is very broad, and it contains businesses with very different margin profiles. The difference in margin profile is due in part to the nature of those businesses and in part to the way that we account for them, in some cases, we account on a net basis as opposed to a gross basis. And so as a result, the services gross margin percentage over time will be influenced by the relative growth of the different businesses within the portfolio.",1
"We do not guide at the product and services level, but I think you've seen the guidance that we provided for the March quarter at the total company level, 42.5% to 43.5%, obviously very strong compared to our recent history. And so we're very pleased with that.",1
"Congrats on the solid iPhone result. That's very good. I assume that you may have prioritized iPhone to the extent there may be similar components that are used for iPhone and iPad. Can you just level set me on that if that's not the case? And if it is, should we see a recovery in iPad as you move past your prime iPhone selling season and you may have better access to components or better supply as we move through the next few months of the year?",1
"Yes. Kyle, it's Tim. From a supply constraint point of view, as you recall, we said that in Q1, the December quarter, that would have constraints more than 6, and we clearly did have constraints more than 6. On March, we're saying that where we will have -- we will do better or have less constraints than we had in the December quarter.",1
"If you look at the commonality between different products, there is some. But generally, the challenge is on legacy nodes. And these legacy nodes are by supplier. And so it's much more focused on the supplier than anything else and versus us behind the curtain finding a place to take it. There's not -- none of that, but there is some of that. But largely, we have to take it where the shortages are.",1
"Fair enough. Tim, I think one of the topics investors can struggle a fair a bit with Apple is really just sort of understand visibility around your product road map, and I think some of your tech peers tend to be more vocal about their initiative. Some of them go change their name when they find an initiative thatâs attractive I feel. You folks are spending, I think, $23 billion on R&D in '21. So you're really spending a fair amount. And maybe without telling us the road map, could you just talk about how do you think about where to focus your R&D resources on? And to some extent, is the way to think about this R&D spend, how much of it is really done on things that are more evolutionary in products that are out in the marketplace versus things that we haven't seen yet are on potential new offerings?",1
"We have a little different model. We try to announce things when they're ready or close to ready and try to maintain an element of surprise in there. And so that explains hopefully what we do with our road map. And I think that's proven successful for us, and other people can do it differently, of course, but it's pretty been good for us over time to do that. So we're going to continue to do that.",1
"In terms of deciding where we invest in, we look at areas that are sort of at the intersection of hardware, software and services. And because we think that, that's where the magic really happens and it brings out the best in Apple. And so there are areas that have more than peaked our interest, and we are investing in those. And you can tell through time that we've ramped our R&D spend even more than we were before. And so there's quite a bit of investment going into things that are not on the market at this point as there always are.",1
"Well, the -- with the Apple Watch, there's literally not days that go by without me getting notes about someone that's received a health alert. Maybe it's to do with their cardiovascular health. Or more recently, a lot of people have told me that they fell and was knocked unconscious and couldn't respond and the watch responded for them to emergency contacts and emergency personnel.",1
"I think I'll let Luca comment on the second part of that. But if you back up and sort of look at how we're doing, even though we have 785 million subs, relative to the total number of products offered and the customers that's offered in, there's still a lot of room to grow there. And so I -- the way that I look at it is that we -- there's a lot more greenfield in front of us.",1
"And Ben, on the services engagement and how we think about customers, right, obviously, it's important for us that customers are engaged on our services platforms. And the ones that we have, we know that the more engaged they are, they're more likely to stay with Apple for the long term. So we just obviously track all those metrics, and they're very important for us. And that's why we continue to improve the quality of our offerings and the quantity over time. As you've seen, we launched a lot of new services. We obviously care a lot about new customers as well, and that's why we keep track of the installed base and a lot of other metrics on that front.",1
"It's very similar to what we do with products. I mean, also for products, we care a lot about upgraders. We care a lot about switchers. It's obviously the combination of the 2 that when you put it together provides the level of growth that you've actually seen in our Services business. I mean the last 12 months, we've done over $72 billion of revenue on Services. It's the size of a Fortune 50 company. It couldn't happen with our contribution from both existing and new customers.",1
"First of all, congratulations on stellar quarter in December and all the records that the Apple community has set. Tim, I had a question on the content on Apple TV. When we look at the Apple content that you guys put all on TV original content, it's typically very socially responsible and healthy, for example, Ted Lasso. Has this, in effect, created a constraint or a hesitancy of some sort for Apple to go and purchase studios when they come up? Or have those decisions be primarily financial or otherwise?",1
"We don't make purely financial decisions about the content. We try to find great content that has a reason for being. And we love shows like Ted Lasso and several of the other shows as well that have reason for existing and may have a good message and may make people feel better at the end of it. But we're -- but I don't view that we've narrowed our universe, the things we're selecting from. There's plenty to pick from out there. And I think that we're doing a pretty good job of it as we speak.",1
"Fair enough. And then my follow-up was the Apple vision of healthcare in the future. So you guys have sort of cautiously approached healthcare with iWatch and iPhone. It's mostly a preventative sort of approach. It provides you updates. But do you see a situation down the line where Apple perhaps plays a more active role, either through the Watch or some of the device where perhaps a doctor or a hospital mandates that the watch we want for effectively for critical and vital monitoring? And I was curious if you could just give us some color on how you guys think about health care and iWatch and that confluence?",1
"And so there's a lot that we're doing today. My sense has always been that there's more here. I don't want to get into a road map discussion in the call. But we continue to kind of pull the string and see where it takes us. But we're really satisfied with how we're doing in this area because we are fundamentally changing people's lives and, in some cases, saving people's lives. So it's an area of great interest.",1
We'll hear next from David Vogt with UBS.,1

This concludes today's conference. We do appreciate your participation.,1
"Good day and welcome to this Apple Computer Second Quarter Financial Results conference call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time. for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today.",1
"Speaking today is Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer, and he'll be joined by Apple COO Tim Cook and Apple treasurer Gary Whistler for the Q&A session with analysts.",1
"Apple's second quarter spans 13 weeks compared to the 14 weeks spanned by our first quarter this year. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, earnings per share, Apple's retail initiatives, demand for Macintosh computers, future products, including Intel-based Macs, and non-cash stock based compensation expense. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.",1
"Tim, I'm interested in how you think about the relationship between the total iOS installed base and then the subsequent performance you see within the services or the paid subscriptions. And a second part to that is, how do you look at the existing services business in terms of the growth you get from customers who are already subscribers versus completely net new or greenfield subscribers?",1
"And so -- and even though this is the second product announcement that has 5G in it, we're still really in the early innings of 5G, meaning if you look at the installed base and look at how many people are on 5G versus not, and we don't release those exact numbers, but you can do some math and estimate those, we maintain a very optimistic view on iPhone long term.",1
"Yes. Chris, it's Tim. What I would say is that iPhone has become an integral part of so many people's lives now more than ever. And the active installed base of iPhone continues to grow and is now at an all-time high. And during December, as we had mentioned, we had a record number of upgraders and grew switchers strong double-digit, which I think speaks to the strength of the product. And that's all baked into some -- an enormous customer satisfaction rating of 98% and doing well throughout the geographies. And I've mentioned some of the geos that we track and how many units that we have on the top-selling model charts.",1
"Okay. As a follow-up, a follow-up question is on perhaps the sustainability and repeatability of the growth in iPhone after 2 very good years, well-received product and the 5G upgrade cycle. And I think there was a point in time when perhaps there's a view from some that iPhone was ex growth, and that's been proven wrong. Off of these very strong results, maybe you can speak to your level of confidence that iPhone continues to grow in the future? And kind of what are the avenues for that growth?",1
"Well, and we talked about it on a year-over-year basis because that's probably how most people look at it. And so just to recap what we said. First of all, we expect a record for the March quarter. We expect solid growth on a year-over-year basis. And -- but as Tim was saying, we still expect significant supply constraints but less than what we've seen in December. So I think on that basis, you can do the math around sequential. But given where we are in the environment, given the difficult compare both on iPhone, and as I mentioned on -- during my prepared remarks, on services, we're very, very happy with the way we're guiding and the way the business is going right now.",1
"Yes. So the first question is just a little bit of help in interpreting the guidance. And if you could speak to the March quarter, perhaps in terms of seasonality and seasonal performance. And Luca, as you mentioned last year, because of the later launch of the phone that some of that came into the March quarter, and that was better than seasonal performance in March. Should we interpret because the supply constraints are easing somewhat as you go into the March quarter that we should see something similar that March quarter would get some better than seasonal performance? Is that the correct way to interpret your guidance?",1
"Well, putting aside any kind of thing that sits on our road map for a second in that area, which we obviously wouldn't talk about in the call, I would say that I think Apple Card has a great runway ahead of us. It was rated to the #1 midsized credit carding customer set by J.D. Power and is getting -- has fast become people's main credit card for many, many people. And the growth of Apple Pay has just been stunning. It's been absolutely stunning. And there's still obviously a lot more there to go and because there's still a lot of cash in the environment. And so I think that both of these and whatever else we might do have a great future ahead.",1
"And if I can just follow up, and similarly on Apple Pay, can you just help us think about when you think about the next few years, where are the biggest opportunities, either be it in terms of like geographies or either segments -- customer segments that you may not be tapping into currently and have an opportunity in.",1
"In terms of how we're doing with TV+, we've been honored with 200 wins and 890 nominations. We're doing exactly like we had wanted to. Weâre giving storytellers a place to tell original stories and feel really good about where we are competitively and strategic position of the product.",1
"We don't give out subscriber numbers for Apple TV+. What we do, do is give out a subscriber number for our subscription number for the total number of subscriptions that we had. And I think Luca mentioned earlier we ended the quarter at 785 million. And so we were incredibly pleased with that. That's a huge growth on a year-over-year basis of 165 million. And it counts, as you recall, both Apple branded and third party.",1
"I had a couple. The first question that I had was really on Apple TV+, and I know some of the other players in this market have talked about slowing subscriber growth as we exit the pandemic. So curious if you can share what trends you're seeing in Apple TV and Apple TV+ and how similar or dissimilar they are and how your content is maybe helping you on that aspect? And I have a follow-up.",1
We'll take the question from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.,1
"We're seeing inflation, and it's factored into our gross margin and OpEx that Luca reviewed with you earlier. Logistics, as I've mentioned on a previous call, is very elevated in terms of the cost of moving things around. I would hope that at least a portion of that is transitory, but the world is -- the world has changed, and so we'll see.",1
"That's helpful, Tim. And then maybe just on the supply chain. Obviously, you've been managing it incredibly well over the last 12 to 18 months. And gross margins have actually performed relatively well, mix driven both between products and services. Can you help us think about sort of the quantifiable impact or maybe the costs that you're carrying due to the supply chain that may be sort of -- I don't want to use the word transitory, but we'd expect over the longer term, that might be sort of abate a little bit and you'll get a little bit of a benefit as we get past some of these supply chain issues over the next 12 months or so?",1
"And I would remind you that iPhone was constrained in the quarter. And so I'm not sure where the statements are coming around about inventory, and I can't comment on whether other people have more or not, I don't know the answer to that. Thanks for the question.",1
"Well, I can only comment on, for us. Our sales grew 21% there in the last quarter, and we're very proud of that. I'll stay away and let other people be the economist and make the macro determinations. But what we're seeing there was super impressive with all-time revenue records and a record number of upgraders and strong double-digit growth in switchers on iPhone, which is very important to us. And as I've mentioned before, we had the top 4 selling phones in urban China. And so there's a lot of good there.",1
"I just wanted to dive in perspective on China and sort of the macro climate there and how that sort of pertains to your business as we think about it going forward. And the reason why I'm asking is we've heard some concerns that current policies might have caused a pause in this market and smartphone inventory. Maybe more specifically the local vendors could be a little bit elevated going into Chinese New Year. So we just want to get your thoughts on what you're seeing in this market around, the sort of potential development and then maybe touch on sell-in versus sell-through in that market. And then I have a follow-up.",1
"We expect to achieve solid year-over-year revenue growth and set a March quarter revenue record despite significant supply constraints, which we estimate to be less than what we experienced during the December quarter. We expect our revenue growth rate to decelerate from the December quarter, primarily due to 2 factors. First, during the March quarter a year ago, we grew revenue by 54%. Remember that last year, we launched our new iPhones during the December quarter. While this year, we launched them during the September quarter. Due to the later launch a year ago, some of the associated channel inventory fill occurred during the March quarter last year. As a result of the different launch timing, we will face a more challenging year-over-year compare.",1
"Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, and we're also able to return nearly $27 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. This included $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $14.4 billion through open market repurchases of 93 million Apple shares. We also began $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 30 million shares.",1
"The search advertising business is going well. It's a -- there's lots of intent from search. And we do it in a very private kind of manner, observing great privacy policies and so forth. And I think people see so forth. And I think people see that and are willing to try it out. And we have been growing nicely in that area. It's a part of the advertising area that Luca spoke of earlier.",1
"We set all-time records for both developed and emerging markets and saw revenue growth across all of our product categories, except for iPad, which we said would be supply constrained. As expected, in the aggregate, we experienced supply constraints that were higher than the September quarter.",1
"Once again, that does conclude today's conference. We do appreciate your participation.",1
"Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q1 FY 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Speaking today first is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Please note that, some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
I'd like to now turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.,1
"Thank you, Tejas, and good afternoon. Today, we are proud to announce Apple's biggest quarter ever. Through the busy holiday season, we set an all-time revenue record of nearly $124 billion, up 11% from last year and better than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. And we are pleased to see that our active installed base of devices is now at a new record with more than 1.8 billion devices.",1
"Before I discuss our results in greater detail, I want to first acknowledge the toll that COVID continues to have on communities around the world. In many places, case counts are higher and health systems more strained than at any point throughout the pandemic. On behalf of all of us at Apple, I want to extend our deep gratitude to the scientists, doctors, nurses and so many others on the front lines of combating COVID-19.",1
"Thank you. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcast, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. The numbers for the telephone replay are (888) 203-1112 or (719) 457-0820. Please enter confirmation code 1828830. These replays will be available by approximately 5:00 PM Pacific Time today.",1
"This is our eighth quarter reporting results in the shadow of the pandemic. And while I can't say it gets any easier, I can say I'm incredibly proud of the way our teams have come together and continue to innovate on behalf of our customers.",1
"A few weeks ago, we marked the 15th anniversary of the day Steve revealed iPhone to the world. We knew that we had the beginnings of something fundamentally transformative, though none of us could have predicted the incredible and meaningful impact it would have on all of our lives. The creative spirit that made the first iPhone possible has thrived at Apple every day since. We never stop creating. We never stop innovating. You can see that spirit reflected throughout our products from the incredible performance and capability of our M1 chips to our powerful yet easy to use operating systems to our unrivaled iPhone camera systems to the beauty and magic of AirPods. That's why each of our major products leads the industry in customer satisfaction for their respective category. People expect Apple to solve hard problems with easy to use products. And iPhone has never been more popular.",1
"During the December quarter, we set an all-time revenue record for iPhone, thanks to the strength of our incredible iPhone 13 lineup. This is the best iPhone lineup we've ever had and the reaction from the press and our users have been off the charts. This past quarter, we also set another all-time revenue record for Mac with customers eager to get their hands on an M1-powered MacBook Air, iMac or MacBook Pro. We've been thrilled with the response from Pro users to the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips and to see how Apple silicon is blowing them away with its power, performance and efficiency.",1
"Despite the constraints I mentioned earlier, our iPad lineup continues to be indispensable to tens of millions of people, from teachers and students to artists and creators. Customers are eager to get their hands on our ninth generation iPad, which features a beautiful display and double the storage capacity, as well as the new iPad Mini with its ultra portable design.",1
"Wearable, Home and Accessories, meanwhile, set an all-time revenue record. Customers are loving the Apple Watch Series 7, with its cutting edge health and fitness tracking features. Nearly every day, I get notes from customers who share how a heart alert led to a life saving appointment with a cardiologist. And more recently, I've been hearing from people who tell me that their Apple Watch saved their lives by calling 911, when they couldn't.",1
"As I've said, we're still in the early innings with our health work that every day I'm encouraged by our positive impact.",1
Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at (408) 974-2414. Financial analysts can contact me with additional questions at (669) 227-2402. Thank you again for joining us.,1
"Thank you, Jim. Appreciate that.",1
"Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, and we were able to return nearly $27 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. This included $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $14.4 billion through open market repurchases of 93 million Apple shares.",1
"I think, Chris, it's Tim. I think subsidies always help, that anything that reduces the price to the customer is good for the customer and obviously good for the carrier that's doing it and good for us as well.",1
"Got it, got it. And then a follow-up for Luca. When you look at your Services segment in the March quarter, in China, you typically see a bump due to gaming downloads during Chinese New Year. So should see a similar trend this time around? But do you think with a pandemic, and people think for me at home, that kind of seasonal bump might not happen in China for gaming downloads?",1
"Yes. I mean, I think I was mentioning it during the prepared remarks. We -- clearly, in China, the March quarter is typically the strongest quarter for our Services business and for the App Store because of Chinese New Year, as you mentioned. And last year, what we saw was an increased level of activity because after Chinese New Year, the whole country went into lockdown for several weeks. And so that propensity for playing games continued for several weeks, more than a typical cycle. So, we expect to have a great quarter in China, but at the same time, you need to keep in mind that the compare is going to of what happened a year ago.",1
We'll go ahead and take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead.,1
"The first question is on iPhone ASPs and I know you don't disclose the numbers there, but I wonder if you could speak about it qualitatively. You spoke about the richer mix, but there were also some price differences as compared to a year ago. iPhone 12 came higher price point. The Pro established a new price point. Can you speak to how that the level of benefit that you saw there? And going forward, are you confident that you can continue to improve the next in iPhone going forward?",1
"So, as I said earlier, we grew iPhone revenue 17%. That growth came from both unit sales and ASPs because of the strong mix that I mentioned before. So, I think that answers your question for the December quarter. What we've seen so far, it's very early because we launched the new products only a few weeks ago. What we've seen so far is a very high level of interest for the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max. We worked very hard to ramp up our supply. We've had some supply constraints during the December quarter. We think we're going to be able to solve them during the March quarter. But so far, the mix has been very strong on iPhone.",1
"Okay. As a follow-up question, if you could talk a bit to the benefit that you may have seen from some of the carrier actions? We've seen very aggressive trade-ins during the quarter. Did that provide a benefit, in your view, on units or mix or perhaps both? And what would be the level of permanence that you would see in some of those actions such that if those subsidies were removed, could that potentially be a headwind going forward?",1
"And so, it's a win across the board. I believe that, at least based on what I see right now is that there would be probably continuing to have quite a bit of competition in the market, if you're talking about the U.S. market for customers as the carriers work to get more customers to move to 5G.",1
Congratulations to your team and employees.,1
"Outside of the U.S., the subsidies are not used in all geographies, and so it really varies greatly by country. Some of them are separate completely, the handset and the service. And in those areas, we don't have subsidies.",1
We'll go ahead and hear from Jim Suva with Citigroup.,1
"It's amazing how your company has pivoted and progressed through this uncertain time in society. A lot of the pushback we get on our view on Apple is that everyone around them or that they know developed countries has an iPhone or Apple product and the market is kind of being saturated some. But when I look at other countries like India, I believe statistically, you are materially below that in market share. So are you doing active efforts there? It seems like there's been some news reports of moving supply chain there. Or you recently opened up an Apple Store. How should we think about that? Because it just seems like you're really not full market share equally around the world.",1
"Yes. There are several markets, as I alluded to before. India is one of those, where our share is quite low. It did improve from the year-ago quarter. Our business roughly doubled over that period of time. And so we feel very good about the trajectory. We are doing a number of things in the area. We put the online store there, for example, and last quarter was the first full quarter of the online store. And that has gotten a great reaction to it and has helped us achieve the results that we got to last quarter.",1
"We're also going in there with retail stores in the future. And so we look for that to be another great initiative and we continue to develop the channel as well. And so there's lots of things, not only in India but in several of the other markets that you might name where our share is lower than we would like.",1
"And I -- again, I would also say, even in the developed markets, when you look at our share, definitely, everybody doesn't have an iPhone, not even close. And so, we really don't have a significant share in any market. So, there's headroom left even in those developed markets where you might hear that.",1
We are also making great advancements in audio and are seeing strong demand from customers as a result. The HomePod Mini continues to earn praise for combining the intelligence of Siri with an immersive room filling audio experience. And our customers have responded with a lot of excitement to the magic of spatial audio on AirPods which packs the acoustics of a concert hall.,1
"As always, the deep integration of hardware, software and services is a hallmark of everything Apple makes. It's a principle you can see at work in the introduction of SharePlay, a feature that offers a whole new way to create shared experiences by letting users watch and listen to their favorite content together on FaceTime.",1
"And we continue to invest in innovation across our services business, which set another all-time revenue record last quarter and performed even better than we had anticipated.",1
"First, as I mentioned before, our installed base has continued to grow and has reached an all-time high across each geographic segment and major product category.",1
"For Mac, revenue of $10.9 billion was an all-time record with growth of 25% year-over-year driven by strong demand for our newly redesigned MacBook Pro powered by M1 despite supply constraints.",1
"We are 1 year into our transition to Apple silicon and already, the vast majority of our Mac sales are from M1-powered devices, which helped drive a record number of upgraders during the December quarter. Our momentum in this category is very impressive as the last 6 quarters have been the best 6 quarters ever for Mac.",1
"iPad generated $7.2 billion in revenue, down 14% year-over-year due to very significant supply constraints, but customer demand was very strong across all models. Despite the supply shortages, our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high during the quarter, thanks to a high number of customers that are new to iPad. In fact, around half of the customers purchasing an iPad during the quarter were new to the product.",1
"Wearables, Home and Accessories set a new all-time record of $14.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year. And we set all-time revenue records in each geographic segment. We also continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category to create unique experiences showcasing our deep integration of hardware, software and services.",1
"In addition to an outstanding level of sales performance globally, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.",1
"Turning to services. As I mentioned, we reached an all-time revenue record of $19.5 billion, up 24%, with all-time records for cloud services, for music, video, advertising and payment services and a December quarter record for the App Store. These impressive results reflect the positive momentum we are seeing on many fronts.",1
"Next, we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. The number of paid accounts on our digital content stores grew double digits and reached a new all-time high during the December quarter in every geographic segment. Also, paid subscriptions continue to show very strong growth. We now have more than 785 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up 165 million during the last 12 months alone.",1
"The App Store continues to be an economic miracle for developers around the world and a safe and trusted place for consumers to discover their favorite apps. Since its launch, we have paid developers selling digital goods and services more than $260 billion, with 2021 setting a new record for their earnings.",1
"And finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love, and we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current service offerings. Just in this last quarter, we have added incredible new content on Apple TV+, on Fitness+ and Apple Arcade and a brand-new way to listen to music with Apple Music Voice.",1
"We also announced in November the beta program for Apple Business Essentials, a new service offering that brings together device management 24/7 support and iCloud storage to our small businesses, manage the end-to-end life cycle of their employees' Apple devices. We are very excited that many thousands of small business customers are already actively participating in the beta program.",1
"This announcement is just one of many ways we are expanding our support for enterprise and business customers. With the latest MacBook Pros that we've introduced last October, the new M1-powered Mac lineup has quickly become the preferred choice of Macs among enterprise customers.",1
"Shopify, for example, is upgrading its entire global workforce to M1-powered MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. By standardizing on M1 Max, Shopify continues its commitment to providing the best tools to help its employees work productively and securely from anywhere.",1
"And Deloitte Consulting is expanding the deployment of the Mac Employee Choice program, including offering the new M1 MacBook Pro to empower their professionals to choose devices that work best for them in delivering consulting services.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. Due to our strong operating performance and holiday quarter seasonality, we ended the quarter with $203 billion in cash, plus marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $123 billion. As a result, net cash was $80 billion at the end of the quarter.",1
"Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 9% year-over-year to an all-time record of $71.6 billion despite supply constraints, thanks to a remarkable customer response to our new iPhone 13 family. We set all-time records in both developed and emerging markets, reached all-time high in the iPhone active installed base and the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%.",1
Net income of $34.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.10 both grew more than 20% year-over-year and were all-time records. Operating cash flow of $47 billion was also an all-time record.,1
"Our Services set an all-time revenue record of $19.5 billion, up 24% over a year ago, with December quarter records in every geographic segment. Company gross margin was 43.8%, up 160 basis points from last quarter due to volume leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by higher cost structures. Products gross margin was 38.4%, up 410 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and mix. Services gross margin was 72.4%, up 190 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix.",1
"The strong level of sales performance, the unmatched loyalty of our customers and the strength of our ecosystem have driven our current installed base of active devices to a new all-time record of 1.8 billion devices. The growth in the installed base were broad-based as we set all-time records in each major product category and in each geographic segment.",1
"On the product side, revenue was $104.4 billion, up 9% over a year ago, despite significant supply constraints. We grew in each of our product categories, except iPad, where supply constraints were particularly pronounced, and set all-time records for iPhone, Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories.",1
"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report record financial results for the December quarter. We set an all-time revenue record of $123.9 billion, an 11% increase from a year ago. We reached new all-time records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China and the rest of Asia Pacific. And it was also an all-time record quarter for both products and services.",1
I will now turn it over to Luca to go over our quarterly results in more detail.,1
"Let me close by saying that despite the uncertainty of the world, there is one thing of which I am certain: Apple will continue to [innovate] every day and in every way to deliver on the promise of technology at its best.",1
"We recognize, as ever, that it takes all of us to confront our most profound challenges. And at Apple, we are determined to do our part. That includes our own work and inclusion and diversity, which we are advancing every day.",1
"To celebrate Black History Month, we will be releasing a special edition Apple Watch Black Unity Braided Solo Loop and a matching Unity Lights Watch Face. And through our racial equity and justice initiative, we are continuing to support organizations blazing trails to a more equitable world in our economies, our classrooms and our criminal justice system.",1
"And in keeping with our abiding belief in and commitment to education, we also launched a new partnership with the Boys & Girls Club of America. This initiative will help young people across the U.S. learn to code on iPad using our Everyone Can Code curriculum. And we are continuing to drive innovations to help combat climate change. We are already carbon neutral across our own operations, and we are working intensely to meet our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality across our supply chain and the life cycle of our products.",1
"We also celebrated 15 years of Apple's partnership with a global fund on Project RED supporting their life-saving work to expand healthcare services in Sub-Saharan Africa for people living with HIV/AIDS. With the support of our customers, we've now raised nearly $270 million to fund prevention, testing and counseling services for people impacted by HIV/AIDS.",1
"We have always led with our values and with compassion and care and never has that been more needed than during the pandemic. Last quarter, we celebrated 10 years of our Employee Giving program, which we started to help our employees identify and support the causes they care most deeply about. We pledged to match their contributions to organizations doing important work at every level from their local food pantry to global humanitarian non-profits. In the last decade, this program has contributed nearly $725 million to charitable organizations.",1
"I also want to take a moment to thank our retail employees and AppleCare teams for the deep care you've given to our customers as they look to get the most out of our products, learn new skills or track down the perfect gift.",1
"Despite the pandemic, our retail businesses saw its highest revenue in Apple's history, and we also earned our highest ever customer satisfaction scores. That is a testament to the incredible adaptability our teams have shown as we've reimagined [digital] experience.",1
"Fitness+, meanwhile, continues to inspire customers to reach their health and fitness goals. We recently introduced Time to Run, an extension of our popular series Time to Walk, as well as new collections of workouts and meditations to help users make more intentional training choices.",1
"I'm also happy to report that in its first 2 years, Apple TV+ shows and movies have earned 200 award wins and more than 890 nominations. Among the powerful lineup are feature films like The Tragedy of Macbeth, CODA and Swan Song, along with many gripping new series coming up, including Severance and The Afterparty. Each one is a tremendous credit to all the storytellers in front of the cameras and behind them who touched audiences all over the world.",1
Weâll hear from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.,1
"Sorry. We donât comment on future products. And so, I will try to sidestep a bit. With respect to 5G, I think itâs -- we're in the early innings of its deployment on a global basis. We obviously couldnât be prouder of our lineup and are very excited about our pipeline as well and wouldnât trade our position for anybody.",1
"Thank you for that. Tim, as a follow-up, at some point in the future, Apple will launch a 5G iPhone. How big of a demand driver do you view 5G capability in a handset? And what's your view as to what the killer app will be from a consumer perspective?",1
"Second; subsidies. For various reasons, iPhone subsidies are becoming increasingly less common. In Japan, for example, iPhone purchases were traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contracts. Competitive promotional activity frequently increase the amount of subsidy during key periods. Today, local regulations have significantly restricted those subsidies as well as related competition. As a result, we estimate that less than half of iPhones sold in Japan in Q1 of this year were subsidized compared to about three quarters a year ago and that the total value of those subsidies had come down as well.",1
"We generated record December quarter services revenue in Greater China, fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over 2.5 million registered iOS developers. We saw very strong results from our wearables business there with revenues up over 50%. We also continued to grow our total active installed base by adding new customers.",1
"In fact, more than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during the December quarter were purchasing that product for the first time. Finally, for perspective, despite the challenging December quarter, our revenue from China grew slightly for the full calendar year. Macroeconomic factors will come and go, but we see great upside in continuing to focus on the things that we can control.",1
"Returning to iPhone, I'd like to talk about our results in the context of those lower than expected upgrades. iPhone XR, iPhone Xs, and iPhone Xs Max are by far the best iPhones we've ever shipped. They share advanced technologies including the A12 Bionic, the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone with our next-generation Neural Engine capable of 5 trillion operations per second. These are also completely modern iPhones with stunning large full screen displays and Face ID, the most secure authentication of any kind available in a smartphone.",1
"And the cameras are simply amazing with portrait mode and depth control to allow users to create studio quality photos as well as stunning 4K video, opening a whole new era of photography. We couldn't be more proud of our iPhone lineup and our industry-leading customer satisfaction. We wouldn't change our position for anyone.",1
"Now, our customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in the past. When you pair this with the macroeconomic factors, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue that was down 15% from last year. Our iPhone results accounted for significantly more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, outside of iPhone, our business grew strongly by 19%.",1
"So, what's behind this? It's important to understand what's going on from the customer perspective at the point of purchase. We believe that it's the sum of several factors. First, foreign exchange. The relative strength of the U.S. dollar has made our products more expensive in many parts of the world. In Turkey, for example, the lira depreciated by 33% over the course of calendar 2018 and in the December quarter, our revenue there was down by almost $700 million from the previous year.",1
"Third, our battery replacement program. For millions of customers, we made it inexpensive and efficient to replace the battery and hold onto their existing iPhones a bit longer. Some people have suggested that we shouldn't have done this because of the potential impact on upgrades, but we strongly believe it was the right thing to do for our customers.",1
"Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than we anticipated, our business grew outside of China, including new records in the Americas, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe and our rest of Asia Pacific segment. We had record performance in large markets, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany, Italy, Spain and Korea.",1
"What's very important, however, is that in spite of these factors, our total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3 billion at the end of January of 2018 to 1.4 billion by the end of December reaching a new all-time high for each of the main product categories and for all five of our geographic segments. Not only is our large and growing installed base a powerful testament to the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, but it's also fueling our fast-growing Services business.",1
"In fact Services revenue set an all-time record at $10.9 billion in the December quarter growing 19%. We not only generated our highest global Services revenue ever, but we also had all-time records across multiple categories of Services including the App Store, Apple Pay, cloud services and our App Store search ad business and we had a December quarter record for AppleCare. And I'm very proud to say that nearly 16 years after launching the iTunes Store, we generated our highest quarterly music revenue ever thanks to the great popularity of Apple Music now with over 50 million paid subscribers.",1
The App Store wrapped up its best year ever with record holiday period results propelled by the biggest Christmas Day and Christmas week ever. Customers also spent over $322 million on New Year's Day alone setting us new single-day record for both the number of customers and purchase volume. It was also a great holiday season for Apple Pay with over 1.8 billion transactions in the quarter well over twice the volume of the year-ago quarter.,1
"Merchant adoption continues to reach new milestones. Customers can now use Apple Pay with iPhone and Apple Watch at nearly 3,000 Speedway locations, while all Target Taco Bell and Jack-in-the-Box stores will be accepting Apple Pay soon. We launched Apple Pay in three new countries in the December quarter Germany, Belgium and Kazakhstan and is now live in 27 markets around the world.",1
"The rollout in Germany has been a huge success with Deutsche Bank reporting more activations for Apple Pay in one week than for Android in an entire year. This is yet another example of what's possible when you bring together Apple's world-class hardware, software and ecosystem with our engaged and active user base. Shoppers around the world love Apple Pay and it has increasingly become an indispensable part of daily life.",1
"Revenue from cloud services continues to grow rapidly with year-over-year revenue up over 40% in the December quarter. And readership of Apple News set a new record with over 85 million monthly active users in the three countries where we've launched the United States, the U.K., and Australia.",1
"In the letter we shared earlier this month, we said we are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace and that we believe our business has a bright future there over time. But I think some of that got lost, so I want to share a bit more detail on the positives we see in China.",1
"We'll return to upgrades in a moment, but I'd first want to say a bit more about our business in Greater China. Our revenue there was down by $4.8 billion from last year with declines across iPhone, Mac and iPad. Most of the shortfall relative to our original guidance and over 100% of our worldwide year-over-year revenue decline was driven by our performance in Greater China.",1
Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.,1
"Thank you, Amit. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820, and please enter confirmation code 4783460. These replays will be available by approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.",1
"Itâs a good question. Keep in mind that this year had 13 weeks, last year had 14 weeks. And so even though we were reporting a similar year-over-year growth for Greater China, if you change that reporting to an average weekly sales, which probably is much better way to look at it, there was actually a really nice acceleration. And specifically the numbers this quarter as reported are 11% increase for Greater China year-over-year but on an average weekly revenue basis, we were up 19%.",1
"Also Mainland China, we had an all-time record for revenue in Mainland China. And of course a key part of that was iPhone. And as Iâve mentioned before, Kantar reported that the top five selling smartphones in urban China were all iPhones. And so we could not be more pleased with how we're doing. And if you look at the other -- we obviously grew share for iPhone in the quarter, but we also grew share in iPad and Mac during the quarter and wearables were extremely strong there in the quarter. And so everywhere I look, I feel really good about how we're doing in China.",1
"Luca, maybe a question for you. When you talked about reducing Apple's net cash levels to zero effectively over time, I think that implies -- the number goes from $163 billion today to something like zero. What does over time mean for Apple? Is that one year, three years, 10 years, or how do you define over time? And does this change your thoughts around M&A at all, and is that one reason to get that number from $163 billion to zero. Does it change your M&A thought process?",1
"Let me answer, Amit, starting with M&A. Our thought process around M&A has always been the same, and really doesn't change. We've been acquiring companies over the years. In calendar 2017, we've acquired 19 companies. And the thought process is always to acquire something that allows us to either accelerate our product roadmaps, filling gap in our portfolio, providing a new experience to customers. So it's always with the customer experience in mind that we make acquisitions.",1
"We look at all sizes, and we will continue to do so. We have plenty of financial flexibility, of course. We had that even prior to tax reform. And as I said, we will talk about capital allocation plans when we report at the March quarter and that will include talking about timeframes and pace and so on. And so weâll try to be to be very thoughtful. As we said, $163 billion is a large amount and there are even practical considerations around it. So we'll see.",1
"And just for clarity, let me add one thing. What Luca is saying is not cash equals zero. He's saying there's an equal amount cash and debt, and that they balance to zero. Just for clarity.",1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414, and financial analysts can contact Matt Blake or me with additional questions. Matt is at 408-974-7406, and I'm at 408-974-5420. And thanks again for joining us.",1
"One of those factors, weak macro conditions in some emerging markets was significantly more severe than we originally foresaw, especially in Greater China. As our letter noted, that challenge was compounded by quarterly iPhone upgrades that were lower than we anticipated.",1
Good day and welcome to the Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.,1
"At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"For more information, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the Associated Press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thank you, Nancy and thanks to everyone for joining us today. This isn't the first time you've heard from us regarding the December quarter, so the first thing I want to do is provide some final results and connect those back to the letter we shared at the beginning of the month.",1
"As you know, our December quarter revenue was below our original expectations, coming in at $84.3 billion. That's down 5% from a year ago, or down 3% adjusting for foreign exchange. We noted four factors that would impact our results when we provided guidance in November: different iPhone launch timing from a year ago, FX headwinds, supply constraints on certain products and macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets.",1
"Here in the U.S., the latest data from Comscore shows that Apple News has the largest audience of all news apps. And the international audience will continue to grow with our first-ever bilingual launch in Canada available to customers later this quarter.",1
"In summary, we're very happy not only with the growth, but also the breadth of our Services portfolio. Our revenue from Services has grown from less than $8 billion in calendar 2010 to over $41 billion in calendar 2018. The largest category represents less than 30% of total Services revenue and the new services we've launched in the last few years are all experiencing tremendous growth.",1
"We had our best quarter ever for Mac revenue which was up 9% fueled by our new MacBook Air and Mac Mini introduced in October. The MacBook Air includes a beautiful new Retina display, Touch ID and Force Touch Trackpad while the new Mac mini provides a powerful, flexible solution for everything from home automation to giant render forms.",1
"Given the continued strength and momentum in this part of the business, we now expect the number of paid subscriptions to surpass 0.5 billion during 2020. Our subscription business has become very large and diversified covering many different categories from entertainment to health and fitness to lifestyle. In fact, more than 30,000 third-party subscription apps are available today on the App Store and the largest of them accounts for only 0.3% of our total Services revenue.",1
"However, our global active installed base of iPhones continues to grow and has reached an all-time high at the end of December.",1
"We are disclosing that number now for the first time. And it has surpassed 900 million devices, up year-over-year in each of our five geographic segments and growing almost 75 million in the last 12 months alone. We plan to provide information on the iPhone installed base as well as total installed base on a periodic basis. Customer satisfaction and loyalty for iPhone continue to be outstanding and are the highest in the industry.",1
"The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the March quarter 81% plan to purchase iPhones. Based on the latest information from Kantar, iPhone experienced a 90% customer loyalty rating for iPhone customers in the U.S. 23 points above the next highest brand measured.",1
"Turning to Services. It was our best quarter ever with revenue of $10.9 billion, up 19% year-over-year with new December quarter records in all five of our geographic segments. Many Services categories set new all-time revenue records and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services revenue by 2020.",1
"To be clear and as we've already explained 90 days ago, our 2020 goal remains unchanged and it excludes the impact of the revenue reclassification between products and services we recorded in connection with ASC 606, the new revenue recognition accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2019.",1
"The level of engagement of our customers in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital stores reached a new all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts growing by strong double digits over last year. And we now have over 360 million paid subscriptions across our Services portfolio, an increase of 120 million versus a year ago.",1
"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw great response to the new MacBook Air and Mac mini that we introduced in October, which helped drive a 9% increase in Mac revenue over last year to a new all-time record. Mac revenue was up in the vast majority of countries we track with double-digit growth in many large markets such as the U.S., Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Japan, Korea and South Asia.",1
"iPad revenue was up 17%, its highest growth rate in almost six years powered by the new iPad Pro released in November with its edge-to-edge Liquid Retina display, Face ID and A12X Bionic chip, the new iPad Pro has been described by reviewers as a tablet with no equal and the most powerful mobile device ever made. We also had our best quarter ever for Wearables Home and Accessories with 33% growth in total and almost 50% growth from Wearables, thanks to strong sales of both Apple Watch and AirPods.",1
"Our active installed base of Macs reached a new all-time high and half of all the customers purchasing Macs in the December quarter were new to Mac. We also had great results for iPad with revenue up 17% from a year ago. A strong performance of both iPad and iPad Pro and generated double-digit growth in four of our five geographic segments. Similar to the Mac, our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high and among customers purchasing iPad during the quarter half were new to iPad.",1
"The most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured a 94% customer satisfaction rating for iPad overall, with iPad Pro models scoring as high as 100%.",1
"Among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the March quarter, 68% plan to purchase iPads. Wearables, home and accessories revenue grew 33% to a new all-time record in each of our geographic segments.",1
"Revenue from this category was up over $1.8 billion compared to a year ago, thanks to the amazing popularity of Apple Watch and AirPods both of which were supply constrained as we exited the quarter.",1
"Based on revenue over the past four quarters, our Wearables business is approaching the size of a Fortune 200 company. Our retail and online stores generated strong results for Mac and iPad and all-time record performance from Services and from Wearables.",1
"Following the launch of the new iPhone trade-in campaign, our stores more than doubled the volume of iPhones traded in compared to last year, reaching an all-time high in Q1.",1
"Let me provide more color for the various products categories. iPhone revenue was $52 billion. On a geographic basis, most of the decline from last year came from Greater China and other emerging markets with difficult macro and foreign exchange conditions affected our results. We also believe that the reduction of carrier subsidies and our battery replacement program had an impact in a number of countries around the world. And as Tim mentioned we had a lower number of upgrades than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter.",1
"Net income was $20 billion about flat to last year and diluted earnings per share were an all-time record at $4.18, an increase of 7.5% over last year. Operating cash flow was also very strong at $26.7 billion.",1
"Services gross margin also increased 170 basis points sequentially due to favorable mix and leverage, partially offset by foreign exchange. While both products and services gross margins improved sequentially, total company gross margin was down 30 basis points due to a different mix between products and services.",1
"On a sequential basis, products gross margin increased 60 basis points due to positive leverage from the holiday quarter, partially offset by higher cost structures as we launched several new products and by headwinds from foreign exchange.",1
"Company gross margin was 38%. This quarter for the first time, we're making an important new disclosure to our investors as we believe it will foster a better understanding of our business. We are now reporting on a quarterly basis, gross margin for products in aggregate and for Services in aggregate. Products gross margin was 34.3% and Services gross margin was 62.8%.",1
"Looking at product categories. iPhone revenue declined 15% from a year ago while revenue from the rest of our business grew 19% to an all-time record, including our best results ever for Services, for Wearables and for Mac.",1
"Our results were especially strong in the U.S. where revenue was up by more than $1.5 billion compared to a year ago and in several markets where revenue grew by double digits including among others Germany, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Malaysia and Vietnam.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. As Tim said, revenue for the December quarter was $84.3 billion. This result was below our expectations, but we were able to set new all-time revenue records in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe and Korea.",1
"Now for more details on our December quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.",1
Apple innovates like no other company on earth and we are not taking our foot off the gas. We'll continue to invest through near-term headwinds just as we always have and we'll emerge stronger as a result.,1
We are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business and we have a very strong pipeline of products and services with some exciting announcements coming later this year.,1
"Beginning last week, we started making it easier for people to pay for their phones over time with installed payments and we're working on rolling out this program to more geographies as soon as we can.",1
"We are undertaking and accelerating a number of initiatives to improve our results. It's not in our DNA to just stand around and wait for macroeconomic conditions to improve. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in an iPhone in our stores and raising awareness of this opportunity. Because of the quality and durability of iPhones, they maintain significant residual value making trade-ins a great opportunity. It's not only great for the environment, it's great for the customer as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone and it's great for developers as a phone that is traded in and redistributed can help grow our active installed base.",1
This means iPhone can recognize patterns make predictions and learn from experience and it does all this while keeping personal information private. This is a powerful example of how innovation and privacy can go hand-in-hand at a time when these issues are increasingly important to our users.,1
"We believe we are just beginning to see the impact we can make to improving health and are deeply inspired by the possibilities. Another example is the work we're doing with silicon. We've embedded machine learning directly into the silicon with our A12 Bionic chip. Our custom Neural Engine not only provides power efficiency and incredible performance in a very small package, but it also enables processing of data and transactions directly on the device.",1
"We have an amazingly talented team creating hardware, software and services, optimizing each of them to create an unparalleled user experience. Apple Watch is a powerful example of that. It's humbling to read e-mails from customers around the world telling us how Apple Watch has dramatically changed their lives by motivating them to be more fit and active, by alerting them to potentially serious health conditions such as AFib and by helping them in times of crisis with features like fall detection and emergency SOS.",1
"We don't measure our success in 90-day increments. We manage Apple for the long term and when we consider the keys to our success over time there are three that stand out, our highly satisfied and loyal customers, our large and growing active installed base and at the heart of it all, our deeply ingrained culture of innovation. Thanks to all this our ecosystem is stronger than ever before.",1
"I have two questions as well. I guess first one. Could you just touch on what youâre seeing in China in terms of underlying trends, right now? I think growth was up double-digit year-over-year but essentially in line to what you saw in September. I would have thought that would have accelerated a little bit with iPhone X. Just the puts and takes in China will be great.",1
"It also, obviously, you can also do things with HomePod like use it as a speaker phone. And so if youâre talking to your parents or theyâre talking to their grand kids, its unbelievable audio quality for speaker phone. You can also have Siri call for you, you can send messages, you can get a Uber car or a Lyft car. And so there is just a whole variety of things. And so I think the use cases on this much like our phones will be broad based. Some people will use it significantly for music and others may use it significantly for as a digital assistance; and I think the majority of people will likely use all of it and use all of the functionality of it.",1
"We also set a goal to pass 500 million paid subscriptions during 2020. And given that we are already at 480 at the end of December, we expect to pass that mark during the March quarter. So, now, we are setting a new target for ourselves for paid subscriptions. And so, we are now aiming to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020. So, we feel that the services business is growing incredibly well. Of course, we have launched new services very recently. For example, Apple TV+ just launched in November. And so, while these services did not have a material impact in our December quarter results, we expect that over time they start contributing to the growth of the services business. But, we feel very happy with the 17%.",1
"And so we are now in a position where we have $285 billion of cash, we've got $122 billion of debt for a net cash of $163 billion. We have now the flexibility to deploy this capital. We will do that overtime, because the amount is very large. As I said earlier, we will be discussing capital allocation plans when we review our March quarter results. And when you look at our track record of what weâve done over the last several years, youâve seen that effectively we were returning to our investors essentially about 100% of our free cash flow. And so that is the approach that weâre going to be taking. Weâre going to be very thoughtful and deliberate about it. Obviously, we want to make the right decisions in the best interest of our long-term shareholders.",1
"As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call; we expect revenue to be between $60 billion and $62 billion; we expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%; we expect OpEx to be between $7.6 billion and $7.7 billion; we expect OI&E to be about $300 million; and we expect the tax rate to be about 15%.",1
"Tax reform will allow us to pursue a more optimal capital structure for our company. Our current net cash position is $163 billion. And given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash, we are targeting to become approximately net cash neutral over time. We will provide an update to our specific capital allocation plans when we report results for our second fiscal quarter, consistent with the timing of updates that we have provided in the past.",1
"Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable on February 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2018.",1
Thank you. Our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"Luca, I wanted to talk a little bit about, more about your comments on capital structure. I realize you don't want to give any specifics about what you're actually going to return in the timing. But just maybe if you can talk about how much cash you think you need to have here on the business? And then in terms of ongoing cash flow, since toe overseas cash flow no longer be encumbered, does that change your thought process, in general? And then I have a follow up. Thank you.",1
"Of course, we've been talking about the importance of tax reform over the years, because we believe it's really beneficial to the U.S. economy. What it means to us as a company of course is that, we have additional flexibility right now from the access to the foreign cash. And in the past, we've been addressing this issue by having to raise debt as the cash was overseas; the majority of the cash was overseas.",1
"And then, Tim, maybe could you talk a little bit more about what youâre hearing from customers in terms of the iPhone demand. How youâre thinking about the potential decay rate, for lack of a better term, with the high-end phones and over $1,000 phone versus balancing that with now your ability to ship phones down below $400, because youâve expanded the product line so much when you launched your phones in 2017? Thank you.",1
"Turning to taxes. Due to the recently enacted legislation in the U.S., we estimate making a corporate income tax payment of approximately $38 billion to the U.S. government on our cumulative past foreign earnings. This amount is very similar to what we had been accruing on those earnings in our financial results through fiscal year 2017. Including the $38 billion payment, we will have paid over $110 billion of corporate income tax on our total domestic and foreign earnings during the last 10 years for a cash tax rate of about 26%.",1
"The revenue growth from iPhone across all the geographic segments was in the double-digits. And I think as Luca said earlier, when you change that for an average weekly sales basis, itâs actually 22%. And so it was a stellar quarter for iPhone. The iPhone X was the most popular and thatâs particularly noteworthy given that we didnât start shipping until early November, and weâre constrained for a while. The team did a great job of getting into supply demand balance there in December. But since the launch of iPhone X, it has been the most popular iPhone every week, every week sales. And that is even through today, actually through January.",1
"And so we feel fantastic about the results. The most important thing for us is that really the number, itâs customer satisfaction. And customer satisfaction is literally off the charts on iPhone X. We think about the advances in technology that were a part of the iPhone X from -- we went from Touch ID to Face ID; Face ID has been incredibly well received; the wireless charging, the edge to edge super retina display; and totally new gestures, the user experience is different. And so itâs great to get that kind of feedback.",1
"If you look at the the overall iPhone line to get to the essence of the question, I think. I looked -- I reviewed the top many markets, Iâll talk briefly about the top four. In Urban China and the U.S., the top five smartphones last quarter were all iPhones. And in Japan and the UK, six of the top seven were iPhones. And so in a market that is as large as the smartphone market is, people want some level of choice and theyâre deciding which ones to buy. But we feel fantastic, particularly as it pertains to iPhone X.",1
"Next, weâll go Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.",1
"Growing double-digits of such a large revenue base is impressive in itself. But if I look at March quarter guidance, it does assume a slower average weekly growth in total revenue, as well as, I think on my math, iPhone shipments when you compare it to the December quarter. So just how should we read into a modest slowdown in average weekly growth as it relates to the last question around the decay of demand around the higher priced products? Or any impact that you might be seeing from the lower-priced battery replacements or anything else in the market? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"We are guiding to $62 billion. It's a strong double-digit growth, 13% to 17%. In context, it's $7 billion to $9 billion above last year. So when you put things in perspective and you add the $10 billion of growth that we had in the first quarter and the $7 billion to $9 billion that we're guiding to for the second quarter, you're talking about $17 billion to $19 billion of growth in six months. This is at the macro level.",1
Our tax rate of 25.8% for the December quarter was close to our guidance of 25.5% as the lower U.S. statutory rate from the new legislation was effectively offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax balances.,1
"We launched a new $5 billion ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 23.6 million shares and we retired 3.8 million shares upon the completion of our 12th ASR during the quarter. Weâve now completed over $248 billion of our $300 billion capital return program, including $176 billion in share repurchases against our announced $210 billion buyback program with $34 billion remaining under our current authorization.",1
"HomePod is an incredible product that is a unbelievable audio experience in a very small form factor with a super digital assistant in Siri that knows an enormous amount of music. But also can handle request to like home automation to close your garage door, open your door, turn the light on, turn the fireplace on, change the thermostat, all of the things that you would like to do in home automation. But takes it further, because we think do it right from the home app instead of seeing. So you can see, hey Siri, Iâm reading and your room will change to the things you would like happening in that particular room for when you read, maybe itâs a particular light, maybe itâs a type of light, maybe itâs the fireplace, so on and so forth.",1
"As Tim mentioned, it was our best quarter ever for Apple Watch. And when we add the results from Beats and AirPods, our total revenue from wearables was up almost 70% year-over-year. In fact, wearables were the second largest contributor to revenue growth after iPhone, which is impressive for a business that started only three years ago. In total, our other products category set a new all-time record with quarterly revenue exceeding $5 billion for the first time.",1
"During the quarter, we sold 77.3 million iPhones, the highest number ever for a 13-week quarter. Average weekly iPhone sales were up 6% compared to December quarter last year with growth in every region of the world despite the staggered launch of iPhone X. We established all-time iPhone revenue record in nearly every market we track with double-digit growth in all of our geographic segments. iPhone ASP increased to $796 from $695 a year ago, driven primarily by the launch of iPhone X and the success of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus.",1
"We exited the December quarter towards the lower end of our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory with less than 1 million more iPhones in the channel compared to the December quarter a year ago, in line with our growth in average weekly unit sales. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very, very strong for both consumers and business users.",1
"The latest data from 451 Research indicates U.S. customer satisfaction ratings of 96% or higher across iPhone models. In fact, combining iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X, consumers reported an amazing 99% satisfaction rating. And among business customers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 77% planned to purchase iPhone. Our customers are also incredibly loyal with Comcast latest U.S. research, reflecting a 96% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured.",1
"Turning to services. We had a terrific quarter with revenue of $8.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year and up 27% in terms of average revenue per week; that is an acceleration to the 24% services growth run rate that we experienced in the September quarter.",1
"The App Store set a new all-time revenue record. The Storeâs all-new design is off to a fantastic start with quarterly store visitors, transacting accounts and paying accounts, reaching new all-time highs. During the week beginning December 24th, a record number of customers made purchases or downloaded Apps from the App Store, spending over $890 million in that seven-day period, followed by $300 million in purchases on New Yearâs day alone.",1
"And according to App Annieâs latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases by a very wide margin, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play. Across all our services offerings, paid subscriptions reached $240 million with growth of 58% over last year and they were a major contributor to the overall strong growth in services revenue.",1
"Next, Iâd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.1 million Macs during the December quarter, which translates to 2% year-over-year increase in average sales per week. Mac performance was particularly strong in emerging markets with unit sales up 13% year-over-year and with all-time records in Latin America, in India, Turkey and Central and Eastern Europe. On a worldwide basis, the active install base of Macs was up double-digits year-over-year to a new record.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $285.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $16.2 billion. $269 billion of this cash, or 94% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to $110 billion in term-debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding, for a total net cash position of $163 billion at the end of the quarter. We also returned $14.5 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and spent $5.1 billion on repurchases of 30.2 million Apple shares through open market transactions.",1
"It was also another growth quarter for iPad. We sold 13.2 million units with average iPad sales per week up 8% over last yearâs December quarter. iPad sales grew strong double-digits in many emerging markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe and India, as well as developed markets, including Japan, Australia and Korea. The active install base of iPad has grown every quarter since its launch in 2010, and it reached a new all-time high in December, thanks to extremely high customer loyalty and large numbers of first-time iPad users.",1
"NPD indicates that iPad had 46% share of the U.S. tablet market in the December quarter, up from 36% share a year ago. And the most recent surveys from 451 Research found that among customers planning to purchase tablets within 90 days, 72% of consumers and 68% of business users planned to purchase iPads. Customer satisfaction is also very high with businesses reporting a 99% satisfaction rating for iPad.",1
"We are seeing great traction in enterprise as businesses across industries and around the world standardize on iOS. For example, Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Europeâs leading banks, has chosen iOS as the mobile standard for its entire 70,000 employee base in Italy; choosing iOS for its security, user interface, accessibility and reliability, Intesa Sanpaolo will deploy native apps to improve employee productivity in customer support, human resources, and marketing across the company.",1
"And LensCrafters, one of the largest optical retail brands in North America, will be using over 7,000 iPad Pros to enable digital eye exams and digital optical measurements in a personalized and interactive experience. Weâre also rolling out a new initiative, called Apple at Work to help businesses implement employee choice programs more easily and offer Apple products company-wide.",1
"Resources from both Apple and our channel partners will enable enterprise IT and procurement teams to buy or lease Apple products more efficiently, streamline the setup of iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and deliver a seamless onboarding experience for employees. We launched the program with CDW in the U.S. last week, and we would be expanding to more channels and regions later this year.",1
"The December quarter was extremely busy for our retail and online stores, which welcomed 538 million visitors. Traffic was particularly strong during the four-weeks following the launch of iPhone X, up 46% over last year. And across the quarter, our stores conducted over 200,000 Today at Apple sessions, covering topics including photography, music, gaming, and app development, and art and design. Just last weekend, we opened our first store in Seoul, Korea and weâre looking forward to opening our first store in Austria in a few weeks. These newest openings will mark the expansion of our retail store presence to 21 countries.",1
"We typically don't go into this level of detail, but think it's important this quarter to give you additional color. And maybe the two most important messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double digits as compared to last year, during the March quarter. And also and importantly that iPhone sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis will be actually accelerating during the March quarter as compared to the December quarter.",1
"Let me explain the factors that we took into consideration as we came up with our iPhone units and ASP that are embedded in our guidance. Historically, because the channel fill and the holiday season, our selling volume during the December quarter is generally higher than sell-through. This year, the difference was further magnified, because we shipped iPhone X in November rather than the September quarter. We had a very successful product ramp. We were able to reach supply/demand balance in December, which placed the entirety of our channel fill for iPhone X in Q1 and this will have an effect on both units and ASP in Q2.",1
"Now, for units, there is a second point to consider. We typically reduced channel inventory for our newest iPhones in Q2, because they enjoy very large demand in the initial weeks of sales, which are compounded by the holiday season in Q1. So we anticipate doing that in Q2 this year as well. For ASPs, there's also another element that we need to consider. As you know, our newest products this year have a higher ASP than they had in the past. And so as a result, as we reduce inventories of these newest products, the overall ASPs for iPhone in Q2 will naturally decline sequentially by a higher percentage than we have experienced historically.",1
"Well, that 1.4 billion, I don't know where that came from. It did not come from Apple. And so that's one of the things that kind of flowed out there. And I want to divorce Apple from that number. Weâre not releasing a user number, because we think that the proper way to look at it is to look at active devices. It's also the one that is the most accurate for us to measure. And so that's our thinking behind there.",1
Next question comes from Laura Martin from Needham.,1
"I love the 1.3 billion devices you gave us, updating from two years ago. And Iâd love the onramp as you spread out the pricing. Do you get a sense that we have more unique users in that 1.3 billion than we had unique users back there in 2016?",1
"Laura, I missed the first part of that, you broke up on the phone.",1
"So we have 1.3 billion [technical difficulty] unique users or I mean fewer products, so we have a higher percentage of unique [users] in the 1.3 devices and more in the billion devices. Is it a [technical difficulty] are theyâ¦.",1
"Laura, you're cutting in and out. But I'm going to take a swing at what I think you're asking. I think you're asking, are there more active users today than there were two years ago when we had 1 billion active devices. And the answer is absolutely, there are many, many more.",1
"Yes, I was asking as a percent, the ownership. You see 1.4 billion devices owned per person. Do you think it's now 1.2 billion or 1.6 billion?",1
"Switchers in the quarter, you often give us switchers.",1
"So in summary, our guidance for iPhone; we got double digit year-over-year growth and acceleration of sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis. For the balance of the Company, in the aggregate, we expect to grow strong double-digits year-over-year and particularly very strong performance in service and in wearables like weâve seen during the December quarter. I hope this helps.",1
"It is so early on this product cycle, particularly with the iPhone X only starting in November that we do not feel we have data at this point that would be very meaningful to share. And so I'll pump that question until next time around.",1
Next we'll go to Steve Milunovich from UBS.,1
"Tim, you said you don't want to tell investors what to do. But the first point you made was talking about the size of the install base. Later you've talked about the importance of customer satisfaction. Given that this doesn't look like a super-cycle in terms of unit growth, are you nudging us to focus on the size of the install base, the annuity opportunity here? And do you have confidence that you can monetize that install base through additional hardware and services?",1
"What I said on the investor part is that I think every investor has to look at their own situation and conclude the things that they think are important. What I think is important, I think the active devices are hugely important and that's the reason that we released the number two years ago, and the reason that weâre releasing that again today. That number speaks to the strength of the product the loyalty of the customer, the strength of the ecosystem.",1
And so we do put a lot of weight behind that. And it obviously also fuels the services business. So I have long believed that on 90 day clock on unit sales is a very surface way to view Apple. I think that the far bigger thing is to look over a longer period of time. And customer satisfaction and engagement and number of active devices are all part of that.,1
"And could you address the positioning of HomePod? What category is it in, is it a music speaker, is it a home system, since people seem to be trying to position it versus Amazon and Googleâs offerings? And is the target market primarily Apple Music users?",1
"Where that isn't the case, I am not nearly as sure on that. I would point out that that happened some time ago and so it's very difficult currently to ever get a real time handle on replacement rate, because you obviously not -- you don't know the replacement rate for the products you're currently selling, you only know that in an historical sense. So it's not something that we are overly fixate on.",1
"I think on the replacement cycle, Toni, the answer is, probably looks different by geography. In those geographies that had, in the early days of the smartphone market, had very traditional subsidies where you paid $199 out the door or $99 or whatever. I think it's accurate to save those type of markets. The replacement cycle is likely longer.",1
"But I would say that for the current fiscal year, the guidance that we provided for Q2 should be approximately what you should be seeing. As we get into new fiscal year, so many things change and we need to take that into account, the geographic mix of our products and so on. But I would say for the remainder of the year, it's what weâre guide to.",1
"Toni, on the tax rate, I will make two comments. First of all, the new tax law in the United States is complex. And I think we, as many other companies, are really trying to absorb what this all means. And I think we're going to be receiving, over the next few months, implementation guidance. So we've taken some provisional estimates in coming up with our tax entries for the quarter, and we will have to do that as we go forward here during the year. So it may be a bit bumpy in the short-term as we understand the law in full, and it actually gets explained in full.",1
"And just a follow-up, maybe I could clarify two little things. One, Luca, on tax rate, you talked about 15% for Q2. Is that how we should think about the tax rate on an ongoing basis? And then just back to you on your response, Tim, I guess maybe you could just comment on whether you believe the upgrade rate has decreased over the last couple of years, because again, just mechanically install base is growing 20 and units are relatively flat over that period. Isn't that telling the install base is -- upgrade rate is going down, or am I not thinking about other considerations? Thank you.",1
"On the battery, Toni, we did not consider in any way, shape, or form, what it would do to upgrade rates. We did it because we thought it was the right thing to do for our customers. And sitting here today, I don't know what effect it will have. And again, itâs not -- was not in our thought process of deciding to do what we've done.",1
"And so I view all of that to be incredibly positive. Itâs more people on iPhones the better. I would like to point out that the ever year major product hit a high on the active install base. And so thatâs iPad, itâs Mac and those are huge numbers as well. And so as weâve always said, there is a large part of the -- or the vast majority of the services are mapped to the install base instead of the quarterly sales. And this quarter is no different on that.",1
"This is up to investors as to what things they would like to focus on, so I donât want to put myself in the position of that. The way that I look at this and the numbers youâve quoted have a different view of them. But generally what we see with iPhone is the reliability of iPhone is fantastic. The second or the previously owned market has expanded in units over the years. And you see in many cases, carriers and retailers having very vibrant programs around trading an iPhone in. And because iPhone has the largest residual rate on it, it acts as a buffer for the customer to buy new one and it lines up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone.",1
"I have a question and follow-up. You commented on how your install based over the last couple of years has grown 30%. And iPhone is clearly the largest component of that, and so iPhone install base is probably growing close to that number perhaps last, call it 20% through 25%. Yet, if we look at iPhone unit growth for fiscal â18 whatâs implied with your guidance fiscal â17 and fiscal â16, itâs been relatively flat. So you have an install base thatâs 20% plus higher, and a unit growth that relatively flat, which would suggest that your upgrade rate is going down or your replacement cycle is elongating. And Iâm wondering whether you agree with that and whether investors should be worried about that. And maybe if I could just add one other wrinkle to potentially get your response on is. Given consumersâ heightened awareness of their ability to replace batteries going forward as opposed to upgrades. Isnât that also something that investors should potentially be concerned about in terms of its impact on upgrade rate going forward? And then believe or not, I have a follow-up.",1
And next weâll go to Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.,1
"I see AR as being profound. I think, AR has the ability to amplify human performance instead of isolating humans. And so I am a huge, huge believer in AR. We put a lot of energy on AR removing very fast. We've gone from ARkit 1.0 to 1.5 in just a matter of months. I couldn't be happier with the rate and face of the developer community, how faster developing these things. And I donât want to say what we may do. But I could not be happier with how things are going right now.",1
And then how you're think about AR beyond iPhone? You've created the world's largest AR platform. You've got developers generating a wide variety of apps. I realized it's still early days. But do you see Apple as a provider of a larger ecosystem of AR-enabled device beyond iPhone and iPad in the coming years? Or should investors focus on the opportunity within your existing device portfolio for at least the foreseeable future? Thanks.,1
"Mike, you did a good job of answering your question. I think at the beginning, we donât really comment on future products. But I would tell you that weâre thrilled with the reception of iPhone X. And as we said when we launched it, we were setting up the next decade. And that is how we look at it. And so that's the reason it's chockfull of incredible innovation. And so you can bet that we're pulling that string.",1
"I know you don't talk about future products, which is often presses to questions about future products and I'll give it a shot. When you think conceptually about the path for iPhone X Style devices going forward. Is there any reason the roadmap wouldnât consists of multiple devices as weâve seen with past iPhone upgrades? In other words, the 10 was unique amongst recent iPhone launches, because it's a singular device, potentially limiting the shots on go for upgrades given limited options. How do you think about that, going forward? And then I have a follow up.",1
"Certainly, weaker dollar in the long term, if it holds, will be a positive but it's not something that you're going to be seeing translating to gross margin tailwind quickly. And so I think we need to keep that in mind. We also need to keep in mind that we continue to experience a difficult memory pricing environment, which we think is going to start improving as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. But it still has a negative impact in the March quarter.",1
"Let me walk you through the sequential first. So weâre guiding about flat sequentially in spite of the loss of leverage. That is the largest element that we need to take into account because of our typical seasonality. And we expect to offset the seasonality impact with cost improvements and with mix. FX on a sequential basis is fairly muted, because as you know, we've got a hedging program that protects us from the volatility of currencies in the short term.",1
"Yes, that's great color. Just a follow-up on gross margin. Guidance for flat gross margin in March is pretty seasonal, but you do have the tailwind from currency. And so if you can just comment on how you think that flows into the model over the next couple of quarters, the weaker dollar. And what your outlook might be around component costs in the near future. Thank you.",1
"We added Thailand to our footprint with a beautiful store in Bangkok and we opened a stunning new store on Champs-Elysees in Paris exiting the quarter with 506 physical stores in 22 countries.

"Products revenue was $79.1 billion, up 8% as iPhone returned to growth, and we had incredibly strong results in Wearables where we set all-time records for both Apple Watch and AirPods. Services revenue grew 17% to a new all-time record, $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in every geographic segment and new all-time records across our portfolio.",1
"We began 2020 with our greatest product line-up ever and we are only deepening our commitment to do our part to make the world a better place. In November, we released a completely redesigned Everyone Can Code curriculum to help introduce more elementary and middle school students to the world of coding. The new curriculum includes even more resources for teachers, a brand new guide for students and updates Swift Coding Club materials. Today, millions of students in more than 5,000 schools worldwide use Everyone Can Code curriculum to bring their ideas to life and develop important skills, including creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving.",1
"November also saw the launch of our new research app, the latest in our ongoing effort to put the future of health in the hands of every user. Customers in the U.S. can enroll in three landmark multiyear health studies that weâre undertaking with leading academic and research institutions. The Apple Women's Health Study, the Apple Heart And Movement Study and the Hearing Study, as in everything we do, we build user privacy into the research app from the ground up.",1
"This quarter we also announced a $2.5 billion plan to help address the housing availability and affording crisis in our home state of California. We feel a great responsibility to help the region we have always called home stay vibrant and to ensure that it remains a great place for everyone to live and raise a family, including those who do so much to serve the community, like firefighters and teachers.",1
"In much more recent news, weâre closely following the development of the coronavirus. We're donating two groups that are working to contain the outbreak, we're working closely with our Apple team members and partners in the affected areas, and our thoughts are with all of those affected across the region.",1
"As we close the books on a record-breaking December quarter, we are already well underway on some new and exciting developments for the future. Appleâs strength will always be its boundless creativity and innovation, and this year will be no different. But for now, for more details on the results, I would like to turn the call over to Luca.",1
"Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional as we set new all-time records for revenue, net income and earnings per share. Revenue for the quarter was $91.8 billion, up $7.5 billion or 9% from a year ago, in spite of a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange. Geographically, we established all-time revenue records in many major developed and emerging markets including, among others, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.",1
"Company gross margin was 38.4%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue, despite of a negative 60 basis-point impact from foreign exchange.",1
We also want to take a moment to congratulate all the Grammy winning and nominated artists this past weekend who rely on Logic Pro 10 and the Mac to create incredible music we all love.,1
"Products gross margin was 34.2%, up 260 basis points sequentially, thanks to leverage and favorable mix. Services gross margin was 64.4%, up 30 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%. Before discrete items, the rate was 16.5%, exactly in line with our guidance. A favorable one-time item impacted the rate by 230 basis points.",1
"Net income was an all-time record of $22.2 billion, up $2.3 billion or 11% over last year. Diluted EPS was also an all-time record at $4.99, up 19% and operating cash flow was a very strong $30.5 billion, an improvement of $3.8 billion over a year ago.",1
"Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue of $56 billion grew 8% year-over-year, as we saw a great customer response to the launch of our newest iPhones. We set all-time revenue records in several countries, including the U.S. Mexico, the UK, France, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam.",1
"Our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high and is growing in each of our geographic segments. In the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined. Among business buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 84% plan to purchase iPhones.",1
"Turning to services. We set an all-time revenue record of $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in all of our five geographic segments. As Tim mentioned, we established new all-time records for Apple Music, cloud services, payment services and our App Store search ad business and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. We are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal year â16 services revenue during 2020. We've actually already reached that goal on a run-rate basis with the results of the December quarter.",1
"Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number of both, transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits in all of our geographic segments. We now have over 480 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 120 million from a year ago. And at this point, we expect to hit our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark already during the March quarter. Given the tremendous momentum we're experiencing across our services offerings, we're increasing our target for paid subscriptions and aim to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020.",1
"I want to call out and celebrate the exceptional work of our retail and online teams. This quarter, we opened a beautiful new store in Kawasaki, Japan. And exciting things are taking place inside each and every store. Thanks in part to a doubling in iPhone trade-ins versus last year, our retail and online stores set an all-time record and delivered strong double-digit growth in iPhone. We see a very bright future for these efforts and we continue to innovate to ensure that everyone who visits an Apple retail location has a great experience.",1
"This was also a very exciting quarter for the Mac as we launched our most powerful notebook ever. The 16-inch MacBook Pro, as well as Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR, the most powerful tools Apple has ever put into hands of Pros. And weâve already seen a strong response from the Pro community from developers, photographers and music producers to filmmakers and scientists who rely on the Mac to create their lifeâs best work.",1
"Apple technology has made possible a simplified user experience integrating the SAP cloud platform, yielding better accuracy, efficiency, and employee experiences across the board.",1

For the App Store, 2020 started off strong with customers spending a new single day record $386 million on New Year's Day alone, a 20% increase over last year. Apple Arcade, our new game subscription service has been fast off the blocks with a catalog of over 100 new and exclusive games you wonât find anywhere else, all playable across Apple devices with new games and expansions added every month.",1
"We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings. We generated revenue of $91.8 billion, which is above the high-end of our guidance range, with revenue growth accelerating for the third consecutive quarter. Geographically, we set all-time records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Specific and saw Greater China return to growth.",1
Our record performance was fueled by iPhone where December quarter revenue was up 8% year-over-year and by our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth outside of iPhone including a new all-time record for services and another blowout quarter for Wearables.,1
"Our active installed base of devices has now surpassed 1.5 billion, up over 100 million in the last 12 months alone, reaching a new all-time high for each of our main product categories and geographic segments. Not only is our large and growing installed base a powerful testament to the satisfaction, engagement and loyalty of our customers, but it's also fueling our growth across the board, particularly in services. Letâs take each category one by one.",1
"On iPhone, revenue in the December quarter was $56 billion, again thatâs up 8% over a year ago, thanks to the exceptional demand for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. In fact, iPhone 11 was our top-selling model every week during the December quarter and the three new models were our three most popular iPhones.",1
"We had double-digit growth in many developed markets, including the U.S., the UK, France and Singapore, and also grew double digits in emerging markets led by strong performances in Brazil, Mainland China, India, Thailand, and Turkey. These new models are by far the best iPhones we've ever shipped with advance technologies and unprecedented leap in battery life to easily get through the day and our best-in-class camera experience. We have been wild with the photos customers have shared in our all-new Night Mode photo challenge this month.",1
"Turning to services. Q1 revenue reached $12.7 billion, an all-time record, growing 17% over last year. Once again, we saw double-digit growth in all five of our geographic segments and established new all-time records from multiple categories including cloud services, music, payment services and our App Store search ad business, as well as setting a December quarter record for the App Store and AppleCare.",1
"Apple TV+ is off to a rousing start, and I want to congratulate the entire team at The Morning Show for their multiple Golden Globe nomination. Jennifer Aniston on her Screen Actors Guild award and Billy Crudup on his Critics Choice award.",1

"We are thrilled with the continued growth at Apple Card. And last month, the customers began using Apple Card monthly installments at Apple retail and online to purchase new iPhones and pay for them over 24 months. We see great promise for these recently launched services, and we're optimistic about what we've got in the pipeline for each of them.",1
"Now, turning to Wearables. We had another incredible quarter, setting an all-time record in virtually every market we track around the world, and this product category is now the size of a Fortune 150 company. Demand for AirPods continues to be phenomenal, particularly for our recently launched AirPods Pro, our new addition to the AirPods family that features active noise cancellation.",1
"Apple Watch had a great start to fiscal 2020, setting an all-time revenue record during the quarter. It continues to have a profound impact on our customersâ lives and it continues to further its reach as over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter were new to Apple Watch. Both AirPods and Apple Watch were must have holiday gifts, helping drive unprecedented results for the category, even as we face supply constraints for Apple Watch Series 3 and AirPods Pro.",1
"Mac and iPad generated $7.2 billion and $6 billion in revenue, respectively, and the high level of customer satisfaction and loyalty for both products drove the active installed base of both Mac and iPad to new records in all geographic segments.",1
"App Store revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased almost 40% year-over-year.",1
"Our first-party subscription services also continued to perform extremely well. Apple Music set an all-time revenue record, offering a catalog of over 60 million songs to our customers. iCloud also generated an all-time revenue record, growing very-strong double digits while offering our customers a safe, secure and seamless experience across all their devices. It was a December quarter record for AppleCare, thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and expanded distribution, many of our partners have come to appreciate the strength of the AppleCare brand and our ability to deliver the very-best service and support in the world. That value resonates with both our partners and our customers, and we are very happy to see that quality of experience delivered to more and more of our users.",1
"Next, Iâd like to talk about Mac and iPad. Mac revenue was $7.2 billion and iPad revenue was $6 billion. Both products had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the launches of MacBook Air here, Mac mini and iPad Pro during the December quarter a year ago and the subsequent channels fill. Despite the tough compare, on a demand basis, our performance for both Mac and iPad was around even to last year.",1
"I'll talk about supply chain and customer demand some to give you some color. With respect to the supply chain, we do have some suppliers in the Wuhan area. All of these suppliers, theyâre our ultimate sources, and weâre obviously working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production loss. We've factored best thinking and the guidance that we've provided you.",1
"Thank you, Tom. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"That will come from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.",1
"Thank you very much. I wanted to go back to revisit China. Tim, can you talk about what you are seeing in the region -- what you were seeing in the region prior to the health crisis? And then, can you also update us a bit in terms of your manufacturing strategy, dual-sourcing, geographic diversification, even with the region, just so we have some idea of how this will be managed? Thank you.",1
"Yes. Thanks,, Shannon. In terms of China, the results from last quarter, and then I will get into the coronavirus in a second. For the results from last quarter, we had double-digit growth for iPhone in Mainland China. So, that was an important change from where we've been running. We also had double-digit growth in services in Mainland China and we had extremely strong double-digit on Wearables. And so, really, there were a number of different factors in terms of the things that customers are responding to. iPhone 11 is doing well there, the product has been very well-received with its battery life and the camera is unbelievable. We also, as you probably know, have certain trading programs going and financing programs. These have also been well received.",1
"And so, itâs sort of the sum of all of this. And we are tracking quite a large percentage of new customers on products like the Mac. Three quarters of the customers buying a Mac in China are new, and nearly two-thirds of the customers buying iPad are new. So, it was a terrific quarter. We had three of the top four selling smartphones in urban China according to Kantar.",1
"In terms of the coronavirus, as I mentioned earlier, first and foremost, our thoughts are with all of those that are affected across the region. And as I've mentioned, weâre donating to groups that are working to contain the outbreak. We are also working very closely with our team and our partners in the affected areas, and we have limited travel to business critical situations as of last week. The situation is emerging and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely. As Luca had mentioned, we have a wider than usual revenue range for the second quarter due to the greater uncertainty.",1
"With respect to supply sources that are outside the Wuhan area, the impact is less clear at this time. The reopening of those factories after Chinese New Year has been moved from the end of this month to February 10th, depending upon the supplier location, and we've attempted to account for this delayed start up through our larger range of outcomes that Luca mentioned earlier.",1
"Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter, were new to that product. And the active installed base of both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high. The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 93% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and 92% from businesses, and among both consumers and businesses were planning to purchase tablets in the March quarter 78% plan to purchase iPads.",1
"With respect to customer demand and sales, we've currently closed one of our retail stores and a number of channel partners have also closed their store fronts. Many of the stores that remain opened have also reduced operating hours. We're taking additional precautions and frequently deep-cleaning our stores as well as conducting temperature checks for employees. While our sales within the Wuhan area itself are small, retail traffic has also been impacted outside of this area, across the country in the last few days. And again, we have attempted to account for this in our guidance range that weâve provided you. I hope that gets you some color.",1
"Yes. That was very helpful. Luca, maybe if you could just touch on from a gross margin from perspective, the commodity pricing environment and availability. Obviously, there has been some movement on DRAM and NAND. So, if you can talk about how you are thinking about inventory levels and managing that going forward? Thank you.",1
"Yes. As I said earlier to the question around the gross margin guidance for the March quarter, we are seeing a benign commodity environment. Most commodities have been declining during the December quarter, and we expect the same to happen in the March quarter. As always, and as you probably know, we look at the way these prices move and at times when we feel itâs appropriate we buy certain commodities in advance. And so, we will continue that practice as we go through the year.",1
That will come from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.,1
"Luca, can you address the modest slowdown in services growth this quarter, 17% versus 18% in September? Which services categories accelerated versus where did you see some deceleration in the growth?",1
"Katy, let me make a couple of comments here. The 17% during the December quarter, we look at it against our fiscal year â19 growth rate, which was 16%. So, we feel very good about the results for the December quarter. As Tim and I mentioned during our prepared remarks, it was very broad-based growth because we grew double digits in services across all the five geographies. We set all-time records for many, many categories, music, cloud, search ads, payment services, December records for the App Store and the AppleCare. If you remember, we had set two goals for ourselves in the services segment. The first, we set a goal to double our fiscal â16 revenue during 2020. And when we look at it on a run rate basis, weâve already achieved that goal with the results of the December quarter.",1
"So, retail stores did fantastic on iPhone, very strong double-digit growth in iPhone from a year-over-year point of view. And one of the factors that enabled that was the -- getting to a monthly payments on the Apple Card to make it very simple. Of course, thatâs U.S. only at this point, but the U.S. is very key market for us. And so, it was an important part of it.",1
"Great. And then, my second question is I think you indicated that last month we started offering consumers the ability to use their Apple Card to buy an iPhone on an installment basis. Can you talk about how thatâs had an impact on your unit sales for iPhones?",1
"Hey, Tom, itâs Tim. We are primarily measuring our sales on the number of subscribers. As you can tell from the way that we launched the product, we started with a very aggressive price at $4.99. And in addition to that we have our bundle where if you buy pretty much any device, youâre getting a year for free. And so, we're very focused on subscribers. That said, the product itself is about storytelling. And we think if we do that well, then we will find that there will be some number of those that will also be critical acclaimed. And we're seeing that with the morning show, we're seeing that with Little America and others.",1
"So, congrats on the launch of Apple TV+. I wanted to know internally, how you're getting success, is it truly on critical acclaim, is it on number of consumers that are using the service, contribution and service revenue, et cetera, et cetera? Thank you.",1
That will come from Tom Forte with D.A Davidson.,1
"Yes. That's right, Amit. Itâs about flat sequentially, and by the way significantly higher on a year-over-year basis. But on a sequential basis, you are right, on one side we got the loss of leverage from the usual seasonality but we expect that that loss of leverage will be offset by better mix and cost savings.",1
"Perfect. And I guess, Luca, you could just touch on gross margins. The March quarter guide I think implies gross margin of flat to actually up 10, 15 basis point. It's rare for you guys to actually guide gross margins up in March I think because you have a fairly high seasonal sales deleverage happening. So, what are the offsets that's enabling what looks like a better than seasonal guide for gross margins?",1
"Yes. Amit, itâs Tim. If you look at the Apple, the Wearables as a category within the Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue, Wearables grew 44%. So, it was very strong, as you say. Both Apple Watch and AirPods did very well in terms of collecting new customers. Apple Watch in particular, 75% of the customers are new to the Apple Watch. And so, itâs still very much a selling to new customers at this point.",1
"Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess, first one for me on Wearables, fairly impressive to see, itâs already a $10 billion business for you guys. Could you just touch on the growth that you are seeing on the Wearables side? How much the growth you think is coming from first time buyers of AirPods or Apple Watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the products that they have, because it looks to us the adoption rate is fairly low in your installed base, so there should be a long run way, but love to just understand how you see the growth divided between those two buckets.",1
Yes. That will be from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.,1
"Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock, payable on February 13, 2020 to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2020.",1
"Finally, as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $63 billion and $67 billion. The wider than usual revenue range comprehends uncertainty related to the recently unfolding public health situation in China. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 39%. We expect OpEx to be between $9.6 billion and $9.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $250 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%.",1
"We returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. We began a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 30.4 million shares. We also repurchased 40 million Apple shares for $10 billion, through open market transactions, and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. As we have done for the last several years, we would share our plans for the next phase of our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with $207 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued a 2 billion euro-denominated green bond, retired $1 billion of maturing debt and reduced commercial paper by $1 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $99 billion at the end of the quarter and we maintained our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.",1
"Another example is Butterfly Network, a medical imaging company, which makes handheld ultrasound device that connects to iPhone or iPad to enable clinicians to take an ultrasound anywhere at a cost that is dramatically lower than other solutions in the market today.",1
"We also continued to see strong demand for our products in the enterprise market as our technology solutions enable businesses to do their best work. 100% of Fortune 500 companies in the healthcare sector use Apple technology in areas such as patient experience, clinical communications and nursing workflows, and we're also seeing smaller companies in this sector drive innovation with our technology and apps. One example is Gauss Surgical, which uses Core ML in iOS to more accurately estimate blood loss during child birth and surgery. This helps clinicians have more complete and timely information on whether a patient needs an intervention, which can impact both, clinical outcomes and costs.",1
"Wearables, home and accessories established a new all-time record with revenue of $10 billion, up 37% year-over-year with very strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments and growth across Wearables, accessories and home. We set all-time records for Wearables in virtually every market we track, even as we experience some product shortages due to very strong customer demand for both Apple Watch and AirPods during the quarter.",1
"Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expenses, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speaks as of their respective dates.",1
"At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.",1
"There are, I would say three factors that explain this difference between the 24.5% to the 19%. The first one is that foreign exchange plays a role. Roughly 60% of our Services business is outside the United States. And as you know the U.S. dollar has appreciated in recent months. And in general, we tend not to reprice our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent basis.",1
"We are also broadening the scope of many of these services. If you take Apple Pay as an example, it started off as the most convenient, most private and most secure way to make a payment in a store or in an app. Then we took Apple Pay to Safari, then we started a peer-to-peer service and we're launching it in new markets across the world every quarter, so we are broadening that scope.",1
"And of course, similar to what we've done in the past in the last three years, we launched several new services, we're also looking to launch new services going forward that we believe will provide great value to our users and we're really very excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us.",1
I think you're referring to the deceleration in the growth rate that we've seen in the December quarter. And I think you're referring back to the growth that we reported in September.,1
"I think an important point I need to make, and I think it's helpful that you asked the question, is that a portion of this deceleration is truly just a reclassification of the amortization of free services that we've made in connection with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. And as we explained 90 days ago, this amortization of free services in the past was reported under Products and now gets reported under Services.",1
"The reclassification is actually dilutive to our growth rate because the amortization of free services is a relatively stable number, which gets applied to a growing base. So this reclassification reduces our growth rate versus the previous classification. This factor by itself represents roughly one-third of the deceleration that you're seeing.",1
We talked about 27% growth in the September quarter. With the reclassification that growth rate was about 24.5%. So that explains about a third of that deceleration.,1
"The second factor is a well-known issue around the App Store in China. The App Store in China is a large business for us. We believe this issue around the approval of new game titles is temporary in nature, but clearly is affecting our business right now.",1
"However, the foreign exchange issue that Luca spoke of in the call and -- made that difference or amplified that difference in international markets, in particular the emerging markets which tended to move much more significantly versus the dollar.",1
"And then thirdly, we are seeing some level of deceleration in AppleCare, which has had very, very strong growth during fiscal 2018, where we're starting to lap some of the increase in distribution coverage that we put in place recently and the channel fill of Apple components that happened when we increase the distribution coverage. But in general, we are very, very pleased with 19% growth and we think that the business will continue to grow nicely going forward.",1
"Thank you for that color. Just a quick follow-up, Luca. Share repurchases in the December quarter were well below the run rate from the June and September quarters. How much did the weaker quarter play into your ability to carry out the buyback at the same level? And what should we think about is the right run rate going forward?",1
"Well, we've always said that we're very committed to executing our program. We have done almost $250 billion of repurchases from the beginning of the program. But we've also said that we want to execute the program in an efficient, effective, I will say, disciplined manner. And that takes into account also overall market conditions.",1
"So, that's what we did during the course of the December quarter. We -- our fundamental view remains the same. We are optimistic about our future and we think there is great value in our stock. And so we will continue to execute the program. We will continue to report at the end of every quarter. And by the way, when we report our March quarter results, we will also talk about the next step in our capital return program which is something that we do traditionally in the spring.",1
The next question will come from Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research.,1
"Great. Thank you very much. Some have the perception that you priced the new products, the new iPhones too high, what have you learned about price elasticity? And do you feel that perhaps you pushed the envelope a little bit too far and might have to bring that down in the future?",1
"Thirdly, as you mentioned, our subscriptions are becoming a very large portion of our business and they're growing very well above services average. And the fact that we are saying that we will surpass 0.5 billion during 2020, we're not putting a specific date during 2020, but I think you've seen over recent quarters that we've been adding about 120 million on a year-over-year basis for a number of quarters now. And this is an incredible staggering number, right, when you think about it.",1
"Second, we are making it easier for our customers to transact on our digital stores. We accept many more payment methods today which are very common in certain countries around the world. We've also increased the distribution coverage for many of these services. We're bringing AppleCare to more points of sale around the world. We are launching Apple Pay in more and more markets and so on.",1
"The second factor for the growth of the services business is that within this installed base the percentage of users who are paying for at least one service is growing very strongly. This is due to several factors. First of all, we're offering more and more services. During the last few years, as you know, we launched Apple Music, Apple Pay and advertising service for our developers on the App Store. All these businesses are growing very strongly.",1
"As we just told you, the installed base continues to grow very nicely. It has reached 1.4 billion active devices at the end of December and really very little of our services revenue is driven by what we sell in the last 90 days.",1
"So far, we've been able to grow about 20%. In fiscal 2018, we grew 22%. So we are on track to achieve our objective. And it's important to understand what is driving the growth of the business. First of all, it's our installed base.",1
"Yes, Katy, let me take that one. First of all, when we talk about the services business, it's very important to start from the momentum that we have. As you know, we have set an ambitious target for ourselves to double the size of our business from fiscal 2016 to 2020, which implied at the time a 19% CAGR.",1
"But if you compare what you added in 2018 versus what you expect to add over the next two years, that implies a slowdown in annual net new subscribers. So should we be thinking about services as a lower growth segment than what you experienced in 2018? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon. Services growth did decelerate from the growth rates in recent quarters, so can you talk about the factors that played into that slower growth? And then, appreciate the new disclosure around paid subscribers.",1
Certainly. Our first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourselves to two questions. And may we have the first question please?",1
"Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock, payable on February 14, 2019 to shareholders of record as of February 11, 2019.",1
"We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%. On a sequential basis, this range reflects seasonal loss of leverage and a 60 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by commodity cost savings. We expect OpEx to be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 17%.",1
"Consistent with our historical cadence, we plan to provide an update on our overall capital return program when we report our March quarter results. As we move ahead into the March quarter, Iâd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $55 billion and $59 billion. This range reflects a negative year-over-year impact of $1.3 billion from foreign exchange, which represents about 210 basis points of last year's revenue and a more uncertain macroeconomic environment than a year ago, especially in emerging markets.",1
"As we explained in the past, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. As part of this plan, we returned over $13 billion to our investors during the December quarter. We repurchased 38 million Apple shares for $8.2 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $245 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $102.8 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding, for a net cash position of $130 billion.",1
"By using Metal in Split View with the iPad camera, construction workers can compare building plants and 3D models to what is actually being built in real time. This new iOS app reduces wasted raw materials and helps keep building projects on time and on budget.",1
"Weâre also seeing great innovation in the construction industry, with iPad and new third-party apps made for iOS. For instance, Procore Technologies has introduced an app to help decrease building errors on the job site.",1
"Steve, it's Tim. If you look at what we did this past year, we priced the iPhone Xs in the U.S. the same as we priced the iPhone X a year ago. The iPhone Xs Max which was new was $100 more than the Xs. And then we priced the XR right in the middle of where the entry iPhone 8 and entry iPhone 8 Plus have been priced. So, it's actually a pretty small difference in the United States compared to last year.",1
"And so what we have done in January and in some locations and some products is essentially absorbed part or all of the foreign currency move as compared to last year and therefore get close or perhaps right on the local price from a year ago. So, yes, I do think that price is a factor. I think part of it is that, the FX piece.",1
"Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.",1
"In the past that deferral and the subsequent amortization was reported under products. Now in connection with the new revenue recognition standard, we are reclassifying essentially that amortization from products revenue to services revenue. So total revenue has not changed, we just report that estimated value under the Services category. We also reclassify the cost that we need to incur to provide those services. So the gross margin rate of these services is clearly significantly dilutive to the overall Services margin. I hope I've...",1
"The second way is AirPlay 2, which we have as just pointed out we have support on a number of different third-party TVs. And we're excited about that. It makes the experience in the living room with people using our products even better. We think that people are really going to like that.",1
"Another way is, of course, all the third-party video subscriptions that are on the store. We are participating in this today. And I would guess that that's going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and people begin to buy likely multiple services in place of their current cable bundle.",1
"And then finally, original content where we will participate in the original content world. We have signed a multiyear partnership with Oprah. But today I'm not really ready to extend that conversation beyond that point. We've hired some great people that I have a super amount of confidence in and they're working really hard and we'll have something to say more on that later.",1
The next question will come from Walter Piecyk with BTIG.,1
"Great, thanks. I just have a question on the free services. Can you just describe how the math works on that? Is it that the free services are non cash revenue that's getting booked in the Services revenue with no cost and then the costs come out of products? Can you just run us through what the current status versus how you were accounting for that before?",1
"Yes in essence when we sell a product at a certain price, we make an assumption. We estimate the value that can be associated to providing free services. In our case, it's providing Maps services, providing Siri and providing free iCloud to all the customers that purchase our product. And so we calculate an estimated value. That value gets deferred and gets amortized over the estimated period of time that we deliver the free services.",1
"So it did make services gross margin, got it. And then my other -- my second question is just, when you think about growth in Services, you have selling more to existing paid subscription customers or it's the 300 million going to 0.5 billion. If you can just talk at a high level as far as when you look at growth going forward, is it about -- what is the mix in terms of selling more to existing users, getting new users or -- and maybe some of the individual services that you see the biggest growth opportunity? Thank you.",1
"And then secondly in some markets as I had talked about in my prepared remarks, the subsidy is probably the bigger of the issues in the developed markets. I had mentioned Japan, but also even in this country even though the subsidy has gone away for a period of time. If you're a customer that your last purchase was a 6s or 6 or in some cases even a 7, you may have paid $199 for â and now in an unbundled world it's obviously much more than that. And so we are working through those and we've got a number of actions to address that including the trade-in and the installment payments which I had mentioned as well.",1
"Yes. I mean as I said I mean essentially what -- services -- I said services too is our installed base. So the first driver is growing the installed base. Installed base has grown nicely over the last several years. We've added 100 million in the last 12 months alone. So that's the first step. Then within that installed base, of course we want to make sure that there are more people that are so interested in our services that in addition to transacting on those services on a free basis, they also are interested in paying for those services. And I mentioned that the percentage of paid accounts has increased strong double-digits. So we want to continue to do that.",1
"We want to make it easier for our customers to actually use our services and so we are accepting more and more payment methods around the world. And clearly, as you said the idea of adding new services is very important to us. During the last three years, we've added Apple Pay, which has been incredibly successful and is a wonderful customer experience.",1
"We've added Apple Music, where we now have more than 50 million paid subscribers and continues to grow very nicely. And we've added a very useful service to our developers. We provide an advertising service for developers in the App Store.",1
"The way we've added these services in the past, obviously, we're also very interested in adding new services that can provide great value to our customers in the future. Now we don't want to get into product announcements here, but obviously that is part of our strategy.",1
"Thank you all. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcast, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. Please enter confirmation code 2358120. These replays will be available by approximately 5:00 PM Pacific Time today.",1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414. Financial analysts can contact Matt Blake or me with additional questions. Matt is at 408-974-7406, and I'm at 408-974-5420. And thanks again for joining us.",1
And I think that it'll likely take place at a much faster pace this year. And so we're going to participate in that in a variety of ways. One of those is through Apple TV and you're well familiar with that product.,1
"Yeah, Shannon, we see huge changes in customer behavior taking place now. And we think that it will accelerate as the year goes by to sort of the breakdown of the cable bundle that's been talked about for years.",1
"Okay, thank you. And then Tim, can you talk a bit about video? You've signed a myriad of deals. There was announcement about -- there are TV app directly on Samsung. So perhaps when this comes out you'll be multi-platform. I'm just curious how you view the opportunity in video. And I guess assuming, you can just leverage the costs that you've made already, it should be accretive to margin I would think?",1
"But I wouldn't draw necessarily a conclusion on how this services gross margin is going to move over time. We will report of course at the end of every quarter. But important to keep in mind, it's a broad portfolio with very different gross margin profiles within the portfolio. It is important for us to grow gross margin dollars. And if at times we grow services that are at a level of gross margins, which is below average, as long as this is good for the customer and as long as we generate gross margin dollars we're going to be very pleased.",1
"And so depending on how these separate businesses do in the marketplace, we're going to be seeing some level of movement going forward on services margins. But you've seen that for the last 12 months they've gone up nicely 450 basis points and sequentially they've gone up 170 basis points.",1
"For example, you know that on the App Store, we book revenue on a net basis and therefore the gross margins tend to be accretive. But we also have services that are very successful, that are below the average for the services business.",1
"Yes, Shannon. I think you've seen that Services gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by a significant amount. Let me start with sequential because I think it's probably most relevant for us. Sequentially, we increased 170 basis points. It's a business that is growing nicely, so we get good support from our scale. Some of these services are scaling quickly and so we tend to expand gross margins there. And also, we had favorable mix. As you probably know, we have a very broad portfolio of Services. Some of them tend to be accretive to the average gross margin for services, also because of the way we account for them.",1
"Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the trajectory of Services gross margin, up about 500 basis points it appears year-over-year. You talked a little bit about sequential. But what's driving the improvement or will it be volatile as we go through the year depending on quarters and mix? Just whatever color you can give us as we start to forecast this? Thank you.",1
Next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"We do design our products to last as long as possible. Some people hold onto those for the life of the product and some people trade them in. And then that phone is then redistributed to someone else. And so it doesn't necessarily follow that one leads to the other. The cycles -- the average cycle has extended. There's no doubt about that. We've said several times I think on this call and before, that the upgrades for the quarter were less than we anticipated due to the -- all the reasons that we had mentioned. So, where it goes in the future, I don't know, but I'm convinced that making a great product that is high quality, that is the best thing for the customer and we work for the user. And so that's the way that we look at it.",1
"Okay. Tim, at your September event Lisa Jackson, an Apple VP, stated the company needed to quote design products to last as long as possible. And Apple's clearly doing that by helping with the battery replacement program, iOS working on an older range of products et cetera. But I guess the question is why doesn't that mean that replacement or upgrade cycles for iPhones should continue to extend going forward in part because that's almost one of your objectives? And maybe to that end, maybe you can help us understand what iPhones' average replacement cycle might be today, and how that may have changed over the last three to five years. And again, why wouldn't you expect it to elongate over time given some of the aforementioned things? Thank you.",1
"On channel inventory, as you know our historical pattern for iPhone channel inventory is that typically we increase inventory in Q1 and we decrease in Q2. And we think this year will be similar and we've exited the December quarter with levels of inventory that we are comfortable with. So that leaves us with the reality that our iPhone performance in Q1 from a revenue standpoint was minus 15%. And we expect that the key factors that Tim mentioned during the call affecting iPhone performance in Q1 will also have an effect on Q2 starting with the strong U.S. dollar environment. On a year-over-year basis, the negative impact from currency is going to be about $1.3 billion, so that's about a bit more than two points versus last year's revenue and so that obviously plays a role. And the macroeconomic environment particularly in emerging markets will continue to be there. On the positive side, we expect that we will continue to grow revenue nicely from the rest of the business which is not iPhone.",1
"Yeah. I mean three questions there. The first one is a question around conservatism. As we always do when we provide a range, it's a range that we believe we're going to fall within. We've done pretty well with that up until the December quarter, right? I mean, we've been â we didn't miss in years and years. So that's the idea. There isn't a specific level of conservatism. We believe that this is the range where we're going to fall within.",1
"Yes. Thank you. I have one for Luca and one for Tim. Luca, looks like the midpoint of your Q2 revenue guidance implies the steepest Q1 to Q2 sequential decline in iPhone revenues in history. It also implies a year-over-year deceleration in iPhone revenues. And I'm wondering, if you can comment about whether that's conservatism, whether you're entering the quarter with a high level of channel inventory and maybe you can comment explicitly on that, or whether you actually think the macroeconomic conditions are getting worse?",1
The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.,1
"Well Steve, we did mention on the call last quarter that the different timing of our phone launches would affect the year-over-year compares. If you remember, our top models the Xs and Xs Max shipped during the September quarter, which plays the channel fill and the initial sales in that quarter. While last year the iPhone X shipped in Q1 in the December quarter, plays in the channel fill and initial sales in the December quarter. So we knew that this would create a difficult compare for Q1 of 2019 and this is essentially what happened. It was pretty much in line with our expectations. To give you more color I would say that, the XR is our most popular model and it's followed by Xs Max and then the Xs.",1
"I know that you're not giving units going forward, but you said you might make qualitative comments. I was wondering, if you have a comment particularly on the ASP on a year-over-year basis?",1
"And for my follow-up I wanted to come back to something Tim said earlier about that you are not fearing cannibalization; I wanted to ask in context of your iPhone business given the strength you are seeing at the low end of your product line the iPhone 4 being stocked out during the quarter. There seems to be a lot of demand at lower price points for the iPhone, why not get more aggressive at lower price bands and move down market in the iPhone business? Thanks.",1
"And then finally, the PC market grew 4% last year in the March quarter, and this year IDC is projecting that to decline by 3%. So, considering these factors, the underlying performance of the business is much stronger than the 5% to 10% year-over-year growth implies and we remain very confident in our business and our new product pipeline.",1
"Second, the iPhone 5 rollout this year, has been our fastest ever. We are selling in 100 countries by the end of December. Last year, we did not achieve this country distribution until the March quarter, which included China that we launched in January. Third, we made a very good strategic decision to introduce the iPad mini which customers love and to keep the price reduced iPad 2 in the line. As a result of this, we saw a reduction in our iPad ASPs of about $101 year-over-year in the December quarter. And you can see that, our iPad units grew faster than our iPad revenue in the December quarter. We would expect iPad ASPs to be down quite a bit in the March quarter on a year-over-year basis for the same reasons.",1
"Because of the higher cost associated with the large touch screen and more powerful processor required to run applications like Safari, this was the most expensive iPod weâve brought to market for some time. So we had the challenge of establishing a completely new type of iPod at the top of the line at a price point above where weâve been for quite some time, and we succeeded.",1
"Operating margin for the quarter was better than expected at 22.1%, resulting primarily from higher-than-anticipated gross margin and revenue. Net income was $1.58 billion, which was up 57% over the prior December quarterâs results and translated to earnings per share of $1.76. Cash generation for the quarter was over $3 billion, or approximately two times net income.",1
"Iâd like to first talk about our Mac products and services, which represented 47% of total quarterly revenue. We are extremely pleased to have shipped 2.32 million Macs, exceeding the previous December quarter shipments by over 700,000 units and representing 44% year-over-year growth. Thatâs more than 2.5 times the overall market rate of growth for the December quarter based on the latest forecast published by IDC.",1
"Sales of the new iMac we announced in August continued to be very robust, helping drive 53% year-over-year growth in desktop systems. Sales of portables were also strong, increasing 38% year over year. We began and ended the quarter with less than three weeks of Mac channel inventory.",1
"We are extremely pleased with the very successful launch of Leopard on October 26th and the response from both customers and reviewers has been terrific. Total Leopard revenue was about $170 million during the quarter, a significant increase from about $100 million in revenue generated by the Tiger release in its first quarter. We believe that 19% of the Mac OS 10 installed based is already using Leopard.",1
"Now Iâd like to discuss our music products and services, which accounted for 50% of total revenue during the quarter. We sold over 22.1 million iPods, surpassing the record levels sold in the year-ago quarter. We began and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.",1
"One of our primary goals for this holiday season was to establish an entirely new type of iPod in the marketplace, the iPod Touch. This new iPod has the potential to grow the iPod from being just a music and video player into being the first mainstream WiFi mobile platform running all kinds of mobile applications.",1
"In addition to selling very successfully, the iPod touch was responsible for the overall increase in iPod ASPs to $181, which drove revenue up 17% year over year. Last week we announced a major software upgrade for the iPod Touch, including five great mobile applications and the ability to watch iTunes movie rentals on its gorgeous screen.",1
"Revenue grew 35% year over year to $9.6 billion, an increase of almost $2.5 billion over the previous December quarterâs record-breaking results. The revenue growth was driven by record Mac, iPod, and iPhone sales and strong demand for our recent software releases.",1
"According to the latest data from NPD, iPodâs share of the U.S. market for MP3 players in the December quarter was consistent with the year-ago quarter and in international markets, according to GFK, we continued to gain market share year over year in virtually all European and Asian countries.",1
"We were very pleased with the iPhone momentum and customers continued to rave about their iPhones. We sold over 2.3 million iPhones during the quarter and executed successful launches in the U.K., Germany, and France. Total revenue recognized during the quarter from sales of iPhone, iPhone accessories, and payments from carriers was $241 million. Total deferred revenue from iPhone and Apple TV was $1.44 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to $636 million at the end of the September quarter.",1
"I would like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which also posted record quarterly results. Revenue was $1.7 billion, representing 53% year-over-year growth. The stores generated $405 million in segment margins compared to $259 million in the year-ago quarter. We opened our third store in Manhattan on West 14th street, which is off to a great start and devotes an entire floor to the Genius Bar, personal training, and pro lab.",1
"We opened six other new stores during the quarter, ending with 204 stores. With an average of 201 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $8.5 million compared to $6.6 million in the year-ago quarter.",1
"The stores sold a record 504,000 Macs during the quarter, representing 64% year-over-year growth. Once again, over 50% of the customers buying Macs in our stores during the quarter were new to Mac.",1
"Store traffic hit a new record with 38.4 million visitors during the quarter, representing 14,700 visitors per store per week, an increase of over 10 million visitors from the prior December quarter.",1
"Our domestic business performed very well, with revenue growing 27% year over year and we were especially pleased with our international business, which grew 46% year over year.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report our best quarter ever, with the highest revenue and earnings in Apple's history.",1
"Most of my questions have been answered, but I do want to touch on Boot Camp. As I understand it, Apple will not be introducing virtualization software in the Leopard release. Having said that, will Apple support third party software like Parallels and VM-ware?",1
"As it relates to product mix, we saw customers buying up the line. For example, in the Mac business, we had a very strong Mac Book Pro quarter. That certainly helped us from a margin perspective.",1
We go now to Steve Lidberg with Pacific Crest Securities.,1
"Can you provide an update on the retail store plan, what you're targeting in terms of the number of store rollouts in '07, and provide a headcount of where you ended the quarter on the employee side with the retail stores? Thanks.",1
"Sure. We ended the December quarter with about 6,600 employees in our retail stores out of about 21,500 for Apple overall. We opened five stores in the December quarter, would expect to open seven in the March quarter, and would expect to open about 35 to 40 in fiscal '07.",1
We'll go next now to Shebly Seyrafi with Caris and Company.,1
"Thanks very much. You talked about the iPod gross margin increasing better than expected due to mix and component prices, but can you describe what you mean by mix? Because in my analysis, the Shuffle likely did well. Your blended iPod ASP was down 8%. Do you mean the video iPod did perhaps better than you were expecting three months ago? What do you mean by mix, exactly?",1
"To clarify, the gross margin was about 300 basis points better than our guidance, and that really resulted from a better commodity environment across all of our commodities, so not only in iPods but Macs as well. A better product mix -- and I'll come back to that -- and higher revenue from leveraging the fixed costs with the revenue over-performance that we had.",1
"But within the iPod itself, were there positive mix effects? I would think the video iPod gross margin is higher than the shuffle gross margin, for example?",1
"Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.",1
"Well, again, we don't provide individual product gross margins, but our gross margin exceeded our guidance and the iPod line certainly played a role for us in achieving that result.",1
"Thanks, Shebly. A recording of today's call will be available for replay by telephone for seven days beginning at 5:00 pm Pacific Time today and the number for the replay is 719-457-0820. The confirmation code is 7811704. A replay of the audio webcast of this call will also be available beginning at approximately 5:00 pm Pacific Time today at www.apple.com/investor.",1
Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896 and financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570 and I'm at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.,1
"Good day and welcome to the Apple Incorporated first quarter 2008 quarterly results conference call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, Madam.",1
Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer and heâll be joined by Apple COO Tim Cook and Treasurer Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with analysts.,1
"Please note that some of the information youâll hear during our discussion today may consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes and earnings. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2007 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today in the attached press release.",1
"Our stores continued to innovate and provide outstanding customer service. The new concierge teams that were added to all stores were exceptionally well-received by customers and helped direct traffic to the storeâs personal shoppers, express bays, genius bars, and studios for training and other services.",1
"The stores delivered over 300,000 personal training sessions during the quarter, a new all-time high.",1
"Total company gross margin was 34.7%, which was stronger than expected due to a more favorable commodity environment, stronger software sales, higher overall revenue, and a weaker U.S. dollar.",1
"Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions; could you just give a little bit more detail on what your inventory targets are in the channel in terms of weeks? And it seems that you implied that you are unable to meet all of the demand that was out there. Can you give us some more detail on where you might have come up short, either by geo or product line?",1
"The pro segment itself, the part that we can measure the best, which is around pro audio software and video, pro audio was up very significantly year over year and the video business continued to perform very well.",1
"Okay, and what were the effects of the iPhone rebate redemptions during the quarter, if anything? Anything significant?",1
"Bill, I think customers really appreciated that we provided the $100 credit. The impact of that at this point is largely behind us and we saw that in both the September and the December quarter.",1
"And then one last, if I could; on the iPhone unit expectations for 2008, are you guys providing any type of update on that today? Thanks.",1
We remain very confident in hitting the 10 million goal for 2008.,1
And weâll hear from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.,1
"David, are you talking about the Macintosh specifically?",1
"Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, including $92 million in stock-based compensation expense. We capitalized only $1 million of software development expense related to Leopard during the quarter compared to $22 million in the September quarter. OI&E was $200 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 32%.",1
"As you know, our target for the Mac is to be between four and five weeks of inventory and we did not end the quarter within that range. We ended it significantly less than the range. We did that because Macintosh sales were much higher than we anticipated for the quarter, had tremendous momentum throughout the quarter and we are obviously trying to remedy that situation now.",1
"And do you think you can get back within the four to six week range, four to five week range by the end of March?",1
"You know, we donât forecast channel inventory but Peter has given you our guidance and embedded in that is our supply and demand forecast.",1
"Okay, and then just on the iPods, it looks like units were up only sort of in the mid-single-digits year over year, yet you gained some share. Are we reaching a saturation point for MP3 players or is there still room to grow there?",1
We view the iPod market as bigger than a market for just simple music players. This is one of the reasons we developed the iPod Touch and we believe that one of the iPodâs future direction is to become the first mainstream WiFi mobile platform.,1
"As I indicated in my prepared remarks, the Touch is off to a great start. We really succeeded in the introduction and it played a big role in our growing revenue 17% year over year, and we donât think that revenue growth like this is characteristic of a saturated market.",1
But particularly to the pro segment though.,1
Generally the Macintosh business is on fire. Weâve done 44% year over year. The Mac business has incredible momentum.,1
"Yes, thanks. Could I ask another follow-up question on Macintosh here? When you look at the pro segment, now that you have Creative Suite, larger monitors, and more powerful Macs, since theyâve been available, what did that do to the Macintosh business if anything for the quarter? And does that color your outlook here for the upcoming quarter at all?",1
"And that comes from FTN Midwest, Bill Fearnley.",1
"Okay, great, thanks.",1
We ended the quarter below our target range and we started the quarter below our target range.,1
Let me just follow-up; I believe you gave the channel inventory levels for iPods. Can you give a picture of where Mac channel inventory stands today?,1
"I think that the guidance that we have projected of $6.8 billion is up 29% year over year. We provide you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving. We remain very confident in our business and our products and our strategy. Macs just had a terrific quarter. We were up 44% year over year. Weâve had some great announcements at MacWorld, so as I look forward, we remain very confident in the business and the guidance that weâve provided at 29% is actually up from what we did in the year-ago quarter in March where we grew 21%.",1
"If I just look at your revenue guidance for the March quarter, over the last few years the decline was pretty consistently a 25-point decline in March and yet you are guiding for something worse than that. And if I look at the mix of Macs, which is increasing year-on-year and clearly PCs experienced less of a sequential decline than CE products like MP3 players, it would suggest you should actually see better seasonality all else equal in the March quarter. So if you can just walk through why your outlook is suggesting worse seasonality than what weâve seen over the last few years.",1
(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
We remain very confident in our product pipeline and look forward to the rest of 2008.,1
"In closing, we are extremely proud of our record December quarter results as we reached new highs in product shipments, revenue, and profitability. We believe these outstanding results reflect the excellence of our innovative products and we are very proud of the growth we have achieved. We are very enthusiastic about our announcements in the first two weeks of 2008, including MacBook Air, iTunes movie rentals, new software for iPhone and iPod Touch, and the updated Mac Pro.",1
"We expect OpEx to be about $1.12 billion, including about $115 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $190 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 32%. We expect to generate EPS of about $0.94.",1
"We expect gross margin to be about 32%, reflecting approximately $20 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We are guiding gross margin down sequentially primarily as a result of two factors. First, we expect a sequential decline in software sales as Leopard enters its second quarter and iLife and iWork enter their third quarters. Second, we expect sequentially lower revenue due to seasonality as weâve seen in past years.",1
"For the quarter, we are targeting revenue of about $6.8 billion or approximately 29% growth over the prior March quarter. We expect the total quarterly cost of non-cash stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $135 million.",1
"Looking ahead to the March quarter, Iâd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"We had very strong cash generation during the quarter, increasing our cash balance by over $3 billion to end with over $18.4 billion. Cash flow from operations was $2.76 billion.",1
"Charlie, we support Parallels today, they are a key application partner, developer for us. We are clearly supporting them.",1
We go next now to Charlie Wolf with Needham.,1
"Great, thanks. Can you give us any sense of whether you are seeing any cannibalization at all yet going on between the iPod and the iPhone? I know last quarter you said you didnât have enough data. I was wondering if you had enough incremental data now to make a judgment there.",1
I was pleased with all elements of the iPod performance this quarter.,1
"Just one final follow-up. At the Macworld keynote last week, Steve talked about 50% of all Macs in the quarter -- I think this was all Macs, not just retail Macs -- were sold to new users. I think that's the first time we've heard that metric. Can you just tell us where that number had been tracking previously?",1
"For some time, the retail stores have been hitting a number somewhere around 50%. The thing that is new is that this is now expanded to the rest of the channel in the United States. We feel this is yet another indicator that between the halo effect and the fact that we've got the best line of Macintoshs we've ever shipped before, and a great OS, it's the total of all of that that has produced this result. We're thrilled about it.",1
We go next now to Jesse Tortora with Prudential.,1
"Hi, guys. Would you say the iPod gross margin contribution this quarter was due more to better fixed cost absorption on the higher units, or a better cost structure due to product refreshes in the back half of '06? Basically just trying to figure out where the upside came from in terms of the gross margin.",1
"As I commented on an earlier question, I think the larger factors are the ones I cited, the favorable commodity pricing environment and product mix.",1
"Do you think the cost structure on the iPods, are you pleased with the cost structure with the new refresh in the back half of the year, or do you think that's not changed meaningfully?",1
"Great. Peter, one more question. How about as far as the cash use on your balance sheet? Maybe you can give us your thoughts in terms of the buybacks and the acquisitions?",1
"On a longer-term basis, do you see these two markets legitimately converging or is there going to be a place for both a specific iPod-type device and a mobile phone on a longer-term basis?",1
"Not really changed from past quarters. The stock buyback programs and other forms of returning cash to the shareholders are reviewed with the senior management and the board from time to time, but our preference continues to be to maintain a strong balance sheet in order to preserve our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions.",1
We go next now to Bill Fearnley at FTN Midwest.,1
"Yes, good afternoon, a couple of questions here on the Mac product line. How is the Mac Pro performing versus your expectations now and your latest thoughts on the transitions to some of the products that the design professionals are looking for? Also, did Mac Pro help ASPs in the quarter at all? Then I have a couple of follow-ups.",1
"Let me address the total Pro market, which I think is what you're getting at. The Pro market met our expectations internally. However, those expectations were tempered by the fact that some customers are still awaiting the Creative Suite from Adobe to be released. They did release a beta, and I think there's a lot of positive comments about the beta product and they have announced that the release will be coming in the second calendar quarter of this year, so just next quarter. We would hope to see some of those customers that are delaying purchases begin to buy again at that point.",1
"Also on Boot Camp downloads , can you update on that? Are you still on track to add the Boot Camp functionality to Leopard when it's released in the spring?",1
"We are now up to 1.5 million downloads so it continues to be of great interest to a number of different people, and our intention is still the same, to include it in Leopard as we release Leopard in the spring.",1
"We'll see. Again, the iPod has a significant line of different products with different price points and different capabilities and so we'll talk more as time goes on about those. We don't ship the iPhone until June.",1
"As Peter indicated, we just announced the iPhone, so it's too soon to tell. It's hard to predict but we believe that we've got a great line of iPods shipping today that are a very wide range of prices and capacities and form factors to meet a lot of different needs from different consumers, and so we'll see. Perhaps we'll have more on this as we talk again next quarter.",1
"Well, Shaw, as I've said over the last couple of years, we're very confident in our business, in our strategy, and we are investing for both long-term growth in revenue and earnings, and that's certainly true in the March quarter and it was true in the December quarter.",1
"Well, I think several things that I feel really indicate that there is a halo effect:",1
"Gene, we're still a few months away from June and I'm sure we'll share more details as we get closer to the launch.",1
"In terms of Apple TV, maybe you could talk a little bit about projected units or the addressable market, or put some sort of parameters. I know it's the best-selling product on your website right now, so maybe you could put some parameters of how should we think about that Apple TV opportunity?",1
"We just announced last week, as you know. We've just started taking orders, and we plan to ship, as Steve indicated, in February. For this particular quarter, we'll have just a few shipping weeks, and we've incorporated our thinking about both the supply and demand side into the guidance that Peter gave earlier.",1
"Do you think Apple TV is more of a niche market similar to AirPort Express has been for the music market, or do you see this as a broader platform?",1
"If you're asking from a demand point of view, I think we'll see as we move forward. It's really too early to tell. From how we're positioning the product, as Steve indicated in the keynote, we see this as the DVD player of the 21st century so it's clearly not a niche.",1
"Lastly in terms of the halo effect, some investors are disappointed at the Mac number. Obviously you're coming up against a tough comp in the September quarter with the educational quarter, and historically you're flat to down in December. Maybe this is just an example of The Street getting ahead of themselves. How do you conceptually think about the halo effect, and what inning we're in with that?",1
One is that we've grown at three times market.,1
"Thanks. Tim, can you maybe talk a little bit about how you're conceptually thinking about iPhone cannibalization of iPod, specifically at the video iPod level?",1
"That in the U.S., we've grown at 31% versus a market of 3%.",1
"If you look at the latest student monitor information, the intent to buy a Mac is up substantially. As an example, the intent to buy a Mac portable went from 17% to 28% in a year.",1
"Also, my view is that we have significant momentum on the Mac. This is the eighth quarter of the last nine that the Mac outgrew the market and I don't think a lot of people can say that. So we are thrilled with this number. It is higher than what we projected. I can't speak to the models that you guys have, but we are thrilled internally on the number.",1
"Do you have any idea of the 21 million iPods, just a rough guess of what percentage of those went into new iPod owners' hands?",1
I don't know.,1
We'll go next now to Robert Semple with Credit Suisse.,1
"Thanks. One last quick follow-up on iPods, if I could. Could you comment on the linearity of iPod shipments in the first quarter in terms of how the product flowed? Did you have a big burst of product in the month of December, and any additional comments on linearity? Thanks.",1
"From a sell-through point of view, December is obviously a very key month. I would tell you that we had weeks that the sell-through was just stunning on the iPod. We obviously shipped the product prior to the sell-through and so the linearity of shipments is pulled to the left in order to accomplish the sell-through.",1
We go now to Kevin Hunt at Thomas Weisel Partners.,1
"Thanks. Of the 40,000 distribution points you mentioned, can you talk about how that breaks out internationally versus U.S.?",1
"I'll give you our total CapEx, $142 million in the quarter, of which retail was $36 million.",1
"Thanks. On the Apple TV, I know you're not going to give us an outlook on your expected unit shipments, but will you be breaking that out as a separate line item, or will that be part of other music and products as you see it now?",1
It will be a part of the other music-related products and services line.,1
"Thank you. Finally, Peter, you mentioned before that the iLife is a January refresh. We didn't hear anything about that during Macworld. Is iLife still a January refresh time schedule?",1
"We don't announce our future products, but stay tuned.",1
We'll go to Brian Blair - Wedge Partners.,1
"The bulk of the 40,000 are outside the United States.",1
"Hi, I had a couple questions. First of all, can you comment on the Cisco lawsuit over the iPhone name, and will that have any potential impact on your ability to ship starting in June? I have a couple other follow-ups.",1
So more than 50%?,1
"More than 50%, yes.",1
"I know it's early obviously, but can you talk about if there are going to be additional software application download opportunities for Apple on the iPhone?",1
"Again, we'll talk more about the iPhone as we get closer to shipment.",1
We go next now to Shaw Wu with American Technology.,1
"Just one question for Peter. Your OpEx guidance is a bit more than I would expect, given the sequential decline in revenue that you're also guiding. I was just wondering if marketing programs are in place there? I mean expenses associated with marketing your new products, such as iPhone and Apple TV associated with that, or are you just being conservative in terms of the guidance there?",1
In the quarter?,1
"Thanks, Tim. With regard to retail CapEx, did you mention that, Peter? I missed it if you did.",1
"We are disappointed with the results, even though they're consistent with the market in both areas of PC and MP3 and we're putting additional emphasis there. We just started running a localized Mac/PC ad that's getting very, very good reviews there.",1
"Japan, two things. One, the PC market in Japan is among the weakest in the world. IDC was projecting a 16% contraction year-over-year in the home market, which is obviously the market that is most important to us. In the MP3 space, we maintained a 50% share of the market. However, the market did not grow, and with the lower prices that we announced in September, that resulted, along with the CPU performance, to a lower revenue on a year-over-year basis.",1
Thanks for taking my question. Could you quickly go over what happened in Japan? I've got a couple more questions after that.,1
We go now to Jonathan Hoopes at Think Equity Partners.,1
"I guided gross margin down largely as a result of less leverage on fixed costs from the lower revenue, a different product mix, including a full quarter of the iPod Shuffle. I expect higher music sales from the gift card redemptions, and lower software sales as we approach the Leopard release. Those are the primary factors.",1
"To follow up on that, if the number one driver of gross margins was mix and margin performance of the iPod business, why are you expecting margins to fall so much quarter on quarter in your fiscal second quarter?",1
"We don't disclose our pricing plans, obviously, but I would just point out that we sold 21 million iPods. There's not a price issue on iPods. Customers believe they're of great value, and I would make the same point on the Macintosh that grew at three times the market.",1
"Thanks, good afternoon. Hoping to get a feel for how you're thinking about the balance between the very favorable commodity pricing environment, record gross margins and top line growth. In other words, are you thinking about getting a little bit more aggressive on iPod pricing in the first half of the year to pass those commodity savings on to customers?",1
We'll go now to Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.,1
"If you look at 2005 and you look at the Americas line and add retail to it, you would see that sequentially there was a 16% fall, which is the same as this year. That 16% fall was comparing, however, to a 14-week Q1. That suggests that we did better this year.",1
"In 2004, we had a very strange occurrence that we had no G5 processors to ship, if you recall, and so we went an entire quarter without shipping the iMac. In fact, we pushed the introduction out until the end of that quarter and then shipped very minimal units. That also affected our Pro machine sell-through that quarter. So 2004 would not be a good comparison.",1
"Just one other follow-up. I'm a little confused here. I heard you say that Mac units have been typically down sequentially in December over September, but I'm looking at the last four years of data and they've been up every year, including up 25% in holiday '04. I'm a little confused by that comment, so can you just clarify that again for me?",1
"The 40,000 has been relatively consistent for several quarters, although we've taken some channels out and added others. So we've added to the channel over that period of time. The Mac number is up 1,500 across last year.",1
"Okay. And then earlier, Tim, I think you gave the channel numbers for iPod and Mac for this year . Do you know what those were for a year ago? You gave the number of channel locations.",1
"We think the Cisco trademark lawsuit is silly, as we've said before. There are already several companies that use the name iPhone for voice over IP products, and we believe that Cisco's U.S. trademark registration is tenuous at best. We are the first company to ever use the iPhone name for a cell phone, and if Cisco wants to challenge us, we're confident we'll prevail.",1
And weâll hear from Bill Shope with J.P. Morgan.,1
"When we look at the U.K., France, and Germany, there is no obvious evidence of cannibalization at all. In the U.S. where iPod unit sales were flat year over year, it could have been one of the factors but other factors played into that as well, so it is very difficult to say with any precision whether there was cannibalization or not.",1
"Sure, Chris, itâs Peter. We are not going to talk about guidance at a specific product level, but let me give you some things we thought about in coming up with the range of $41 billion to $43 billion. It is that range is a 5% to 10% year-over-year increase. And there are few factors that are impacting the year-over-year results making the strong performance of the business a little bit harder to see. So, let me point a few of these out. First of all, as we have talked about several times on the call, last year in the March quarter, weâve built 2.6 million units of iPhone channel inventory, which allowed us to get into our 4 to 6-week range. That increased the revenue in the year ago quarter by $1.6 billion. And as Tim talked about that was sell-in that was not sell-through, we are thinking about the business on a sell-through basis. So, donât lose sight of the 1.6 billion.",1
"Okay, and then final question; I think you had mentioned initially at the end of the first quarter of iPhone sales that you didnât want to talk about iPhone channel inventory, that it was still a relatively small and insignificant product. Given that it has over $1 billion in deferred revenue, why are you choosing not to disclose that number?",1
"Okay, can you comment on the number of unlocked phones that you believe were sold in the quarter? You had mentioned that on your last call.",1
"We believe that the number of phones bought with the intention of unlocking was significant in the quarter but we are unsure how to reliably estimate the number. In the December quarter particularly, we saw sales increase across the quarter similar to what you would expect with the holiday gift-buying pattern.",1
"But as weâre new in the business, weâre unsure when all the recipients will activate. Some people wait until their existing contracts expire, some may initially use the non-phone features only, others activate in the future, and so at this point we donât have a precise estimate for you.",1
"We see this phenomenon as being an expression of very strong interest in iPhone globally and in that way, itâs a good problem to have.",1
"Can you comment qualitatively -- youâve given the number last quarter -- qualitatively, do you believe the percentage would actually be higher or lower this quarter, or is it too early to tell based on your experience?",1
Itâs too early to tell. I would just say I think it is significant.,1
"Toni, thatâs not the reason we gave. We said that since we only have one channel partner in each of our first four countries, weâre not going to report the inventory but we are going to employ our proven systems and processes to manage the iPhone differently, or effectively.",1
"Well, the observation is that if the U.S. grew at 27%, your stores grew at 50%, and the stores are 30% or 40% of your business in the U.S., then in order to true-up to the 27, you are coming up with a growth rate that is substantially below 27, probably about 10, doing the math in my head real time for the other channels. So Iâm just trying to understand what you saw in those other channels and if there was anything that you observed around linearity in the quarter.",1
It will come from Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.,1
"Yes, thanks very much. Could you help reconcile the 2.3 million iPhones shipped in December versus over the 4 million announced at MacWorld?",1
"Sure. As Steve indicated at MacWorld, the 4 million iPhones were to date as of the keynote and the 3.7 million iPhones that we had sold cumulatively through the December quarter were part of that.",1
So would you say that suggests a fairly significant increase in run-rate since December?,1
Iâll leave the analysis to you but weâre very happy with iPhone momentum. Our customers are raving about their iPhones and we remain confident in our goal for 10 million for calendar 2008.,1
"Could you give us any, either quantitative or qualitative, commentary on how European iPhone uptake is faring versus your U.S. experience?",1
"You can see from the data sheet that the Macs grew in the Americas channel at 35% year over year, Macs grew in the retail channel at 64% year over year. And so that was obviously a part of it.",1
I donât have that number with me and itâs not a number that weâd report. But you can look at the Americas number and the U.S. is obviously the overwhelming majority of the Americas number.,1
Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns.,1
"Thank you and good afternoon. I have a couple of questions, please. Firstly, I wanted to explore more your comments on the different curve that you saw in demand in the U.S. in the last month of the quarter. Was that a statement that was only applicable to iPods or did the linearity curve in the U.S. regarding the Mac business look any different than it did last year?",1
"Unit sales year over year were flat in the U.S., yes.",1
"And then I just want to again tie into the response to the last question, just in terms of as -- you know, with all this traffic coming in, can you give a sense about what you were seeing in terms of consumer behavior in terms of proclivity to spend, issues like that, that give you a sense about what the consumer is doing, what they are thinking?",1
"In the December quarter, Andy, the retail stores just had a quarter for the record books. Our Mac sales were 504,000 in the stores. That was up 64% year over year and over half the Macs we were selling, we sold were to people that had never owned a Mac before, so that trend makes us feel very good.",1
"And lastly, could you give us a sense about store opening plans for this year, what you see in domestic and international split?",1
"We expect to open about 35 to 40 stores in fiscal 2008. Today, about 25 of our 204 stores are outside the United States and weâll open more stores internationally in 2008 than we did in 2007, including our first stores in China.",1
And that comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.,1
"Mac was very strong throughout the quarter. The statement that I made was about iPod and it wasnât a statement that it wasnât strong -- it was a statement that when you got into the gift-buying season, the shape of the curve was somewhat different at the U.S. level, but at the worldwide level it was very, very similar to the previous year.",1
"Okay, and if you strip out retail, what did the U.S. grow at?",1
"And then, can you offer your perspective on what you saw outside your stores? Quick math would say your stores are growing at 50%. The U.S. business grew at 22%. Some rough math might suggest that non-Apple channels only grew in the single digits in the U.S. Can you comment on that? And again, maybe you can -- the Macs are a unique destination, I think, but if we look more broadly in your retail channel, can you comment on what you were seeing in those channels relative to other quarters and also the linearity over the course of the quarter?",1
"Toni, I think there may be some confusion in the numbers. Let me go through these quickly -- Americas with retail grew 29%.",1
How about U.S.?,1
"But when you strip out retail from that totally, and Iâm talking about our retail stores, Americas grew at 22%.",1
What did the U.S. grow?,1
The U.S. grew at 27% year over year.,1
"You know, we just launched in France at the end of November. We launched in the U.K. and Germany in November and earlier November, and so we had very limited experience but we are very happy with all of the launches so far.",1
"Is 3G and Bluetooth important to that 10 million iPhone outlook, as well as to your plans for the European market?",1
We donât talk about new products but we are very confident in meeting the 10 million for the year of 2008.,1
And that comes from Andy Hargreaves with Pacific Crest Securities.,1
"We have moved the number of storefronts carrying Mac now up to 9,500 and that compares to 7,700 a year ago. We have done that because of the momentum that we see in the Macintosh business.",1
Do you have a target?,1
"The only target I am talking about right now is we plan on doubling the number of Best Buy stores, as I talked about earlier in the conference call.",1
How about for iPhone distribution points? How many retail outlets are available within existing countries where the phone is available? And then do you have a target for iPhone distribution points -- and Iâm thinking here specifically around the consumer electronics channel or an expansion of the Best Buy relationship? Thanks.,1
"We have about 2,500 storefronts in Europe that carry iPhone between the U.K., France, and Germany, and we have around 2,000, 2,100 or so in the United States between our stores and the AT&T stores.",1
"In terms of expansion, I donât have anything to announce today in terms of an expansion.",1
"Iâm just wondering on Apple TV if you have any plans to do any new in-store displays or any other marketing to show what the product does, especially at third-party retailers?",1
Based on the roadmap that you have?,1
This is something that we are looking at but have nothing specific to talk about today.,1
"Okay, and then also just wondering if thereâs anything you guys are doing actively to try to promote more corporate use outside of the traditional customers in either your reseller channel or in education that you are doing, training, that kind of thing?",1
"The education market had a record Q1 for us. We grew about five times the IDCâs forecasted market rate of growth of 6%, and this was led by both K-12 and higher ed, and so we were doing excellent in this business.",1
"There are many, many examples of small business using Mac and larger businesses continue to be interested in the Macintosh as well.",1
"Thanks very much, Andy and thanks to everyone. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820, and the confirmation code for the telephone replays is 4273792. And these replays will be available beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.",1
Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414 and financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570 and I am at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.,1
Thanks. I wanted to ask about Mac distribution points in the quarter. How many retail outlets or distribution points was the Mac available during the quarter and do you have any targets for year-end?,1
"Thank you, Shaw. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"Shaw, this is not something that I can comment for you on this quarter. We have not yet been through a March quarter with iPhone so we donât have any history go by as we do with Mac and iPod, so weâll report to you in April what we did for the March quarter.",1
"Okay, and then Peter, I am going to try to take another stab at this iPhone seasonality question. Your guidance implies obviously seasonality for the whole company and you commented on the iPod. I understand itâs a little early but just a little help in terms of what should we think of iPhone seasonality at this point? Or is it just too early?",1
"Shaw, the iMac announcement in August was extremely well-received and the iMac had enormous momentum. In fact, if you look at desktops, the iMac grew faster than notes but the total of our desktops grew at 53% and that compares to an IDC projected growth rate of the desktop market of only 10%, so over five times the market rate of growth.",1
"Thanks. I just had a question, a little more color on your Mac business. I think, Tim, you kind of answered it a little bit but I noticed that our desktop business was a bit stronger than your portable business, at least on a sequential basis and even on a year-over-year basis. Any color there in terms of why that happened?",1
Shaw Wu with American Technology.,1
"Thanks, Tavis. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"Okay, thanks a lot.",1
"As you know, weâve recently begun to sell iPhones and we donât have any experience yet with the March quarter handset seasonality so I canât comment on it.",1
"And then in terms of the iPhone seasonality, historically the wireless phone business is somewhat seasonal in Q1 coming off a typically strong Q4. Should we be building in an expectation of sequentially down shipments or is that something you just donât want to get into at this point?",1
"For the current quarter, our expectation is on DRAM and NAND Flash memories, we believe both of these markets will remain in an oversupply condition. We see LCD, hard drives, and optical markets being close to a supply/demand balance, which should result in some improvement in costs from last quarter. And for most of the other components, we see the seasonally slower March quarter resulting in historic level price declines.",1
"Thanks for taking my question. The last couple of quarters, you guys have mentioned in relation to the guidance for gross margin, the expectation of component costs creeping back up. You didnât mention that this quarter. Should we take that to believe your guidance presumes a roughly flat component cost environment?",1
It comes from Tavis McCourt with Morgan Keegan.,1
We have nothing to announce today.,1
"Okay, do you have any plans to talk about next regions or countries at all?",1
Weâve very confident in meeting the 10 million for 2008.,1
"I wanted to clarify something -- when you talked about the U.S. iPods being flat, youâre talking year over year? I just want to clarify that in the question.",1
"Thank you, Gene. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"Okay, and then can you give us any color on inventory levels for iPhones exiting the quarter?",1
"Tim mentioned that there was -- iPods were flat in the U.S. and that was perhaps due to the iPhone, but you donât know. There may be other factors. I was wondering if there were any of the other factors you wanted to elaborate on -- maybe there were shortages, maybe there was demand issue. I was just wondering what that was.",1
"Okay, just moving on, the MacBook Air, kind of a new thing -- do you think that will be incremental in terms of your Mac units, or do you think it will cannibalize part of the pro and MacBook lines? How should we look at that product in terms of additive or not to your line going forward?",1
"You know, Ben, weâve just announced it, as you know, last week. The customer reaction has been great. The orders are very strong for it but itâs too early to tell before we are shipping the item of the cannibalization factor on the other notebooks.",1
"Okay, and then what in your guidance are you thinking about for iPods? Maybe you donât want to go by product line, but it sounded like you said other factors in the quarter contributed to the flat growth in the U.S. Iâm wondering if you could triangulate what the other factors were to maybe whatâs in your guidance for iPods going forward and whatâs in your guidance for cannibalization of the iPhone to the iPod? Thatâs my final question.",1
"Ben, for iPods in terms of assessing seasonality, weâve learned in the last years that really what drives the MP3 market to different levels are innovative product launches and the seasonal holiday buying in the December quarter, so we would expect to see a sequential decline in iPod sales from the December to March quarters but look, weâre shipping the best iPods that weâve ever made. Weâve launched the iPod Touch and we think itâs been a great success.",1
"And those special things that other factors that impacted the iPod in the U.S., do you want to elaborate on what those were and whether they can continue?",1
Iâm not clearly on what you are asking.,1
"Let me back up for a moment and talk about the iPod results in December and how we look at that internally. We set out to achieve three things in the December quarter with the iPod business. The first was we wanted to hold our already high share that we enjoy in the United States. We wanted to continue to grow share internationally and as weâve already said on the call, we are very pleased to report that we did both of those. In fact, some of the share gains are stunning when you look at the share gains in the U.K., France, Spain, Australia, and several other countries in Asia.",1
"Good afternoon. Thank you. Peter, I want to ask the guidance question another way. Last year on the same conference call a year ago, you guided down about 52% or so sequentially and then came in at $0.87, down only 24% sequentially in terms of EPS. This year you guide down actually better rate at down 47%, so the guidance in my opinion on the EPS, itâs kind of hard to get a feel for how you really feel. I mean, do you feel pretty much like the same as last year, that the good things are ahead of you and the product pipeline is as exciting as last year? Is there anything else qualitatively besides your earnings guidance that could give us a feeling for how you feel going forward? Products maybe, anything.",1
The second thing we wanted to do was to sell at least the number of iPod units that were comprehended in our guidance and we are pleased to report that the sales of over 22 million iPods not only set a company record but were also consistent with what we had contemplated in our guidance.,1
"And the third thing, and most importantly by far from our point of view, as Peter talked about earlier we wanted to establish an entirely new type of iPod, the iPod Touch. The iPod Touch has the potential grow the iPod from being just a music and video player into being the very first mainstream WiFi mobile platform running all kinds of mobile applications, and we overwhelmingly met this goal. Introducing the Touch at the high end of the line may have traded off a bit of unit volume but it was the right decision to achieve the strategic goal of establishing a platform.",1
"Itâs interesting to note that in achieving all three of these, we grew iPod revenue 17% year over year and this growth rate is the highest growth rate that weâve seen in revenue in iPod for a year.",1
So thatâs kind of how we --,1
I got you. The Touch sacrificed a little unit growth but you are happy overall with your execution.,1
Weâre thrilled with it.,1
"Sure. Iâll tell you -- I am very confident in our business, our strategy, and our products. We have just fantastic products that are available to customers today. We are very confident about whatâs in the product line. We are innovating. We are delighting customers. We are gaining share and I just couldnât be more proud of the Apple team and confident in what we are doing. And as regards to the guidance, we gave you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving and our focus is on managing the business.",1
"Next question will come from Ben Reitzes, UBS.",1
"You know, Iâm not projecting volumes on it but I think we have a great product.",1
"When you look at the demand curve across the quarter, on a worldwide basis the curve was very similar to the curve that we saw last year. In the U.S., what you are referencing on the NPD data is that in the gift-buying season, back-loaded in that November and December, we saw a slightly different curve than we did last year but that was made up for in our very, very good growth internationally.",1
"Weâre not providing specific iPhone inventories. As you know, we have one channel partner for each country and weâre employing our proven systems and processes with iPhone to manage inventory efficiently, just like we do with Mac and iPod.",1
"Okay, and then one final question, looking at the ASP trends for iPods, obviously that was a big help this quarter. Do you think we, given the success of the Touch, we should see the ASP trends hold in that level going forward? Or at least going into the March quarter, is that implied in your guidance?",1
"We donât forecast ASPs but as you indicated, the iPod ASP did increase sequentially and year over year and that was a result of a very successful introduction of the iPod Touch. And we just updated the iPod Touch now to include five great mobile applications and the ability to watch movies from the iTunes store and we think that our customers are really loving the product.",1
"Thanks, guys.",1
Next weâll hear from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.,1
"Thanks very much. I have two questions. First of all, could you comment at all on the linearity of iPod sales throughout the quarter relative to normal seasonality? And the reason I ask the question is that NPD data suggests a weakening in sell-through for iPod during the month of December this year. Iâm just wondering if that contributed to any sort of rise in iPod inventories within that four to six week range that you talked about during the quarter, and then a follow-up.",1
"Tim or Peter, are you at all concerned that that might be indicative of where the U.S. economy is heading and where consumer demand is heading? And have you factored that into your guidance for the March quarter?",1
Stock buy-back programs and other forms of returning the cash are discussed with the Board from time to time but our preference continues to be to maintain a strong balance sheet in order to preserve our flexibility to make strategic investments and/or acquisitions.,1
"We give you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving, so no change.",1
"In terms of the economy, weâll leave the economic forecasting to others and we are focused on managing our business. The business performed very well in the December quarter, with revenue in the United States growing 27% year over year. This growth rate was actually faster than last yearâs December quarter, which grew at 21% in the U.S. and for fiscal â07 in the U.S., it grew at 23%.",1
"In the December quarter, our U.S. Mac sales were 43% year over year and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the traffic in the retail stores was amazing. Most of the stores are in the U.S. and our traffic grew by over 10 million customers year over year. As we look outside the U.S., we were thrilled with the business, which grew 46% year over year in the December quarter.",1
"So we remain very confident in our strategy and our business and we are going to continue to invest to innovate in hardware and software products that delight customers and continue to improve the buying experience, both in our stores and in the channel.",1
"Thank you, Peter, and then one final question on share buy-back; you now have $18.5 billion in cash on the balance sheet, no debt, and you are going to generate probably a minimum of $1 billion in free cash flow per quarter this year, and arguably the predictability of your earnings will rise over time as iPhone produces more of an annuity like profit stream for you. Could you talk about how this factors into the Boardâs potential decisions regarding uses of cash and share buy-back?",1
"Sure. Well, Rich, as you said, the cash generation of the business on the December quarter was very, very strong. We -- cash went up by over $3 billion, of which $2.76 billion came from operations and we are I think managing the business very, very well.",1
"Good afternoon. Could we first get an update on Mac channels, Best Buy, what you are thinking in terms of distribution?",1
"We ended the quarter with about 286 stores in Best Buy. We are thrilled with the results that weâve seen. Itâs added to the Mac momentum. We have elected to expand that further and have jointly agreed with Best Buy that weâll expand from the 286 to 600 over the next six months, so weâre very, very happy with how that relationship is coming out.",1
"Okay, and I donât know, Tim or Peter, could you give us an idea on your goals for iTunes rentals? How should we think about the success of that business and is it more a way to drive incremental Apple TV sales or are you looking at it more from a profitability standpoint for that specific unit?",1
"So we think that we are managing our business very well. We are very confident in our strategy and our products and weâll just going to keep coming out with new, innovative hardware and software products that delight our customers and we want to keep growing the company.",1
"Thanks for taking the call. I had a couple of questions. One is on the revenue sharing arrangement that Apple has with the carriers. I noticed that Orange in France is selling the iPhone for EUR399 with a two-year subscription, but itâs selling it for EUR749 unlocked. My question is does Apple share in the incremental revenues that Orange gets on an unlocked phone?",1
"Charlie, Iâm sorry, weâre not discussing the terms of our agreements with the carriers so I canât specifically answer that.",1
"Okay, the second question is what was the -- I think you can answer this one, the division between direct and indirect sales worldwide?",1
Sure. Direct sales in the quarter for Q1 was 46% and that compared to 44% in the year-ago quarter.,1
"Good afternoon. Peter, I realize youâre not an economist, you mentioned earlier in the call, but I think thereâs a lot of conversations going around about the overall health of the consumer, specifically the high-end consumer. And when you hear these conversations, how should investors put into perspective that theme relative to Apple's business in 2008?",1
"Well, as I said before, weâll leave the economic forecasting to others and we are just focusing on managing our business. You know, if the December quarter was any indication, we did incredibly well. Revenue growth here in the United States was 27%. Outside the United States, we were up 46%. The retail stores just had a record quarter. Traffic was up more than 10 million people year over year in the December quarter, if thatâs any indication.",1
"And in terms of the iPhone rollout internationally, do you want to just remind me what the -- is it Asia end of this year or some time in 2008 or what had we set on that?",1
We just introduced it. We think customers are really going to love it but weâll have to see. Our objective with the iTunes store is to run it just a little above break even and we think that it helps us to sell iPods and Macs and that is really our strategy.,1
We still plan to enter Asia in 2008 and we also plan to roll out additional European countries during 2008.,1
Okay. Would Asia -- obviously Japan would be Asia. Thereâs been a lot of talk about China -- anything specific relative to the China market?,1
Nothing specific to announce today.,1
"Okay, and then lastly, Apple TV, you guys have referred to that as kind of a hobby in the past. What was it going to take for that to become more of an actual business that can move the needle?",1
"You know, as Steve covered at MacWorld, many companies have tried in this space and missed. We are back with Apple TV take two with movie rentals directly from iTunes and we think we have it right this time, so weâll see.",1
"So basically donât think of it as a big impact in 2008 but maybe beyond, or --",1
That comes from Charles Wolf with Needham & Company.,1
"Fair enough. All right, I will cede the floor. Thank you.",1
"You know, I am personally extremely happy with what happened in Japan last quarter. As you know, we have struggled there for several quarters and one data point doesnât make a trend but what happened was that the reception to iMac has been tremendous, our desktop chair moved from 6% to 10% year over year. Also, the reaction to iPod Touch was overwhelming, which really helped the iPod business have a much stronger revenue growth rate year over year, and so those two things together really drove Japanâs performance.",1
"Okay, fair enough. Tim, Japan had a little bit of a bounce back, actually a nice bounce back. Was that easy compares or was leading the charge in Japan?",1
"One other thing, if I can -- of course we are talking about largely finished goods sales in the box, but of course weâre shipping Leopard on every Mac and I think thatâs contributing to the great Mac sales that weâre enjoying.",1
"Okay, and then let me ask one --",1
"Well, weâll have to see. We are again, as I said, weâre very excited about Leopard. Customer response has been strong. Sales will be down sequentially in the March quarter and I donât know if itâs going to follow the same trend that Tiger did. Your sales in the first quarter for consumer software titles are always the best but Tiger is doing incredibly well and the installed base is bigger today than what it was when we first shipped Tiger.",1
"Right, so I got that part, Peter, but would you expect a similar trajectory over the course of the March quarter? And also, the 19%, where do you think that goes?",1
"Our sales going back to Tiger in its first quarter were $100 million, or about $100 million and in its second quarter were about $35 million. And as I indicated in the prepared remarks, Leopard sales in its first quarter were 170.",1
"Sure. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, Leopard is off to a great start. Customer and reviewer response has just been off the chart and about 19% as of the end of the quarter of the Mac OS 10 installed base is already enjoying Leopard.",1
"Thanks. I have two, if I could; Peter, is there any help you can give us on Leopard in the March quarter in terms of expectations and perhaps a way to frame it as how did Tiger do on the first quarter run-off, and give us some comparison for how Leopard framed up in December compared to Tiger? Thatâs my first question. Thank you.",1
The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.,1
"I ordered it quickly. So one last question for Peter just to confirm, because I think itâs pretty obvious but I want to make sure -- the 190 you talk about in OI&E, which is down sequentially even though cash is up, is that just reflecting rate reduction?",1
The orders are very strong and so I hope you have a good place in the queue.,1
"Okay, well hopefully -- we ordered a couple so hopefully it will come soon.",1
"We create products that we hope will appeal to all types of people and we think that the MacBook Air will appeal to travelers, to professors, to all different kinds of people who want to access the computer very quickly wherever they are. We think itâs very leading edge, itâs a superior combination of size, weight and performance and form factor, while being very, very competitively priced if you look at what other people are charging for these, and so we think itâs a great segment for us and a great new product.",1
"Okay, and then sort of shifting over to MacBook Air, I donât know, Tim, if you could give anymore ideas as to how we should think about this fitting from a longer term standpoint into your product roadmap -- how do you think about the ultra mobile market? Is this more of a niche product? Should we think technology trickles down over time? Just anymore clarity you can give us, because obviously it could be fairly instrumental in terms of driving revenue.",1
"I know you talked about a June launch, do you think that that will generally be in full production by June, or do you think this is going to be a situation where it will be relatively -- because that 10 million units for '08 just seems pretty low. If you have availability, it would seem that initially that number should be more than easily achievable. So in other words, do you expect to have capacity constraints at the beginning of the shipment of the iPhone?",1
"Gene, calendar year '08 is what Steve referenced in his keynote. The point that he made was that the worldwide market for total cell phones is somewhere around 1 billion and our objective of getting 1% of it would yield 10 million units across the calendar year.",1
"Good afternoon. First in terms of the iPhone, Steve Jobs talked about 10 million units. Is that for fiscal '08 or calendar '08? Where did that number come from? Maybe just a little bit of logic behind that number.",1
"Thanks Richard Chu, could we have the next question please.",1
"So effectively you are saying, so you see no need to reduce prices, in spite of the perceived difference in value?",1
I am saying that anything that we are planning on doing we factored into our guidance. And that we are only selling these while supplies last.,1
"And finally, if upon rough calculations on the implied music and video downloads are revenue streams, are correct, excluding that downloads at iPod, the remainder of the music revenue streams look like they are non-iPod non-download music revenues increased dramatically Q4 to Q1 and could you comment on that and comment on the seasonality and dynamic associated with that business.",1
"Richard this is Peter. There are now over 2000 different accessories that you can buy with your iPod and fundamentally those are the revenue streams that i think that you are referring to. We did very well with our sales with these in the quarter, both the Apple branded and our third party developers that we sold directly. We expect to have a good quarter in March and honestly we are going to learn more about the seasonality of this part of the business because it is bigger, it is growing, i have said this before and believe it to be the case that many people will buy and iPod and then later come back to add accessories to it. And this seems to be a part of our business that has more of a recurring revenue stream, much like the iTunes music stores and we are very pleased with what we are seeing and we are learning more about it.",1
Can you update us on profitability of the music store?,1
The music store in the December did operate above break even.,1
Next question comes from Richard Gardner of Citigroup.,1
"If i can follow on the second question, you kept, as you said, the old product pricing is unchanged, can i fundamentally ask why, just that you assume users perceive the things, your performance for what they need. Could you comment on that?",1
"Tim, i was hoping if you could just give us standard pitch on component pricing and availability during the first and second fiscal quarters for the major commodities that you buy and then also i was hoping if you could give us the mix of web direct sales in the quarter please.",1
"On a component basis, Rich what we saw last quarter was that the, we have a favorable component environment, both in terms of LCDs and memory, both of those were most stabilize than we had predicted, as we enter into this quarter, we continue to see the LCDs being a favorable environment, because supply is greater than demand, we do expect the DRAM market stabilizes on as more of the manufacturing capacity is converted to NAND Flash. Hard drive prices continue to decline but they are declining at a lower than attributable rate due to some underlying components.",1
And any comments on flash?,1
"I would tell not to continue to expect price reductions in the flash area as more and more and people convert their DRAM capacity to NAND in short term, but overall as you can tell by the amount of prepay that weâve elected to do, we view that particular market as not having as many down turns as some of the other commodity markets then, we believe that it is very important to lock supplies for the long term.",1
And then web direct sales in the quarter.,1
We donât release the exact numbers but i would tell you that the web sales was significant in the quarter.,1
We are selling the iMac G5 and the PowerBook G4 15H product while supplies last. And we factored our thinking into our guidance.,1
"What i am saying specifically is that if you look at previous years for Apple, and the Q1 results, and just look at the total revenue, we would not expect the total revenue to look the same sequentially that had in the past, because we were operating at a much higher music content in the Q1 in the holiday period.",1
Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray.,1
On the Macintosh or the iPod?,1
"Gene, is your question on the Macintosh or the iPods?",1
On the Mac side.,1
"We are very confident that we have selected the right course where the future of the Macintosh, we reviewed the roadmap, from many different sources, we believe Intel has the best one by far. Weâve got the launch underway, we were happy that we were able to do that 5 or 6 months before the expectations doing it, and we will have the transition completed much earlier than the market anticipated by pulling again until the end of 2006. And so we are very very optimistic about the future of the Mac and the way we are headed.",1
"But there are also just of couple of, doing the product side which i would say is they are important but there is also, the distribution side and the pricing side, and you guys can probably have an opportunity to really put the hammer down in terms of picking up market share in 2006. So just conceptually, obviously you guys like to talk about pricing, but conceptually do you see Apple being more aggressive, trying to gain market share in 2006 or kind of continue to the status quo of creating the best products, happen âto be more selective in terms of distribution, more selective in terms of price.",1
"We are going to continue to make the best products on the face of the earth, that is reason that we are here. On a distribution basis, we continue to open stores, we also continue to look at different alternatives to the channel, and when responding that we like and we would obviously view that, they are beneficial, i wouldnât want to comment on the price question.",1
"And just last question is, outside of the extra week in the December quarter, and outside of people postponing their purchases in anticipation of the Intel based, is there any reason to think that the seasonality between December March should be any different than previous years?",1
"Just the overall business, the overall seasonality between December and March.",1
"The impact of the Timâs response to the prior question was, effectively that you are assuming a larger seasonal decline in music business than the Mac business?",1
Yes. There is a reason to think that seasonality of the total company would be different because the music business with a much higher percentage of our business in the December quarter than it had previously been and so obviously the iPod would have a different seasonal curve than the Macintosh to have.,1
Okay. That makes sense. Great thank you.,1
"Thanks Gene, could we have the next question please.",1
Richard Chu of Sg. Cowen & Co.,1
"I just wanted to repeat this but, three questions, seasonality on the guidance, you are assuming this similar, i have seen a stronger seasonal decline in the resent systems, is that impromptu to comment?",1
"Richard, we didnât hear you, would you repeat?",1
"Rich, i will add with overall our direct sales which include the web sales that Tim referred to, sales through our retail stores, and direct sales to US education and enterprise and music stores comprised of 49% of total Apple revenue and that was up from 44% in the year ago quarter.",1
"And then may be Peter, just one more simple one for you. Can you talk about the location of the 14 new store openings that you talked about fiscal 2006. How many of those are domestic versus international?",1
"We expect most of those to be domestically but we will continue to open stores in Canada, the UK and Japan as well.",1
Shaw Wu of American Technology.,1
David Bailey of Goldman Sachs.,1
"You mentioned that iPod margins were about above 20% in the quarter, is that from lower component cost, or a better mix and how sustainable is that?",1
"David, i donât want to be specific any of those parts of your question and just we said that they were above 20% in the quarter, and i will report to you in April what they were for the March quarter.",1
"Okay. Let me try something on the Mac side. Do you expect to end the March quarter within your targeted channel inventory range. And if so how much build you think you will have in the quarter, how much you have included in your target?",1
"We donât project channel inventory, David, we guide to a total revenue number and Peter has provided that guidance.",1
"Thanks David, could we have the next question please.",1
Q â Shaw Wu,1
"Thanks Richard Gardner, could we have the next question please.",1
"Yes. Two questions. Europe looked like there was very very strong, just wanted if you could give more color in terms of what happened there in terms of i guess the Mac business versus the music business and then the second question R&D, looks like it took a big of spike in terms of the absolute dollars, but certainly not so on the percentage of the revenue, just wondering how should we think of R&D spending, should we think remaining at these levels, or could it turn down?",1
"Shaw, let me address your R&D question and Tim can talk a bit about Europe. As i mentioned earlier we are very confident in our business and we are investing in the business for long term growth and both revenue and earnings and a big part of that is our investment in engineering and you have seen it go up, each quarter for the last many quarters and just expect it continue to invest not only in engineering but in opening more retail stores and more advertising and marketing program to grow the business.",1
"Shaw, on the Europe side the Mac shipments were up 49% sequentially from September, but as you probably know that the September quarter in Europe is the traditionally weak quarter because the summer vacation that happen across most of Europe. In terms of revenue Europe with retail stores was up over 50% and frankly there were many countries in Europe that had more relatively more iPods constraints so that revenue number was held down iPods a bit more than some of the other geographies.",1
"Thanks Shaw, could we have the next question please.",1
Q - Steve Lidberg,1
I was hoping first with regards to iPod if you kind of outline how you see the opportunity for the iPod in terms of units or other market comparisons and on the total opportunity available and also with regards to creative professional can you comment with regards to the health of that market both from a video perspective as well as publishing?,1
"Thanks Keith Bachman, could we have the next question please.",1
"Okay. Fair enough, thanks very much guys.",1
"I think that is a question for them, however, we worked closely with Microsoft with running Rezatto and if you, i would invite you to try that yourself and we certainly believe that users will be very satisfied with that experience.",1
Any idea when Microsoft and Adobe might be needed.,1
"What we are seeing is that Rezatto runs very well with products like Microsoft Office as an example and as you commented we have already reported the iLight suite and it is shifting on the new iMac, new MacBook Pro. Weâve already ported iWare. Obviously the OS is native and all of the applications embedded in the OS that is just mail, iChat etc., are also ported. Weâve also announced as you refer, that our, the bulk of our Pro application will be available in March natively. It is just includes final product and logic and aperture expenses. There are a lot of things that are already native and in fact as weâve announced last week, the website has recorded over 200 native ads already, and well over 1500 witches. And so we are seeing great moment for our developer community and i think by making the announcement, obviously people are even more anxious than they already were to complete the work and we are very confident that weâll continue to see great momentum in that area.",1
"Well let me ask the software part of the question and Tim, At least at Mac World, the Cox coming natively, and then the Apple software suite is running natively in sounds like Rezatto and emulation is still, going to be a part of the software side of the equation, so you still have the emulation. Do you think that is going to cause people to pause it off in terms of the performance that you didnât get?",1
We are producing the best Macintosh that has ever been produced and there are great products that have Power PC processors in them and incredible products that have Intel processors in them and we just have to see how the customers vote in terms of the percentage of each.,1
"The second questions, is there anyway to conceptually think about your CPU business may split in terms of the units at all between the Intel side and the Mac side in this quarter, is there any kind of general plan that you could think since there is the vast majority of the platform is still on the IBM processor side or the G processor side. Is that 80-20 or any kind of color you could give us there?",1
"We started below our range, we ended below our range, and we had planned that Keith because of the announcements that we made at Mac World.",1
"Two questions if i could. Tim i just wanted to clarify, i think what you said was you started the quarter with some low inventory in the CPU side and you ended a bit low too, so it didnât sound like inventory played a big role in the December quarter in the CPU side can you just clarify that if i could for the first question?",1
Keith Bachman Banc of America Securities.,1
"Thanks Steven Fortuna, could we have the next question please.",1
"Basically, i am a factory man, a different product mix which would include fewer iPods and a lower component cost.",1
"And then, in terms of okay, Iâll leave that alone and then go on to my last question, can you walk through, Tim commented on what you expect for component in the March quarter, go through, because of the kind of puts and stakes that you factored into your gross margin guidance?",1
"Steve, it is Peter, Iâll address that. I am not going to provide specific product level guidance, to think you thought i would, but let me make some comments what was last year and related little bit to this year. Last year we did see a seasonal drop off, in the combination of our iPod and the iPod Mini line which was more than offset by the introduction of the iPod shuffle. And as was widely reported and weâve commented, the iPod was one of the top holiday gifts this season and it is natural to think that they will be decrease in demand in the March quarter from this exceptional holiday result which again included a 14th week. And you can go out get some primary research on what you would see for various CE products.",1
"In terms of the seasonality of the iPod, it seems which you are baking into your guidance, in terms of my model, at least so much of your earnings power for the quarter and for the year for that matter, depends upon what assumptions one makes for seasonality in the March quarter end, looks like your guiding, if i am doing it quickly, it perhaps not accurate, looks about 45% sequential decline in iPod, it looks may be bacon in that kind of a decline to get to the numbers that you guiding to, i think first of all, i am in the ballpark with that and secondly if you donât comment on the iPod things specifically, how do you think about the broader CE market in terms of the typical March seasonality.",1
And our next question will come from Steven Fortuna of Prudential Equity Group.,1
"Just in terms of the big picture here, conceptually where you are going with the market share plan here, do you see yourself being a little bit more aggressive 2006, in terms of your efforts to gain market share, maybe just in terms of breadth of distribution and other ways that you could gain market share?",1
"Thanks Joel, could we have the next question please.",1
We'll go now to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.,1
Robert Semple from Credit Suisse First Boston is our next question.,1
"Let me, Iâll let Tim address, our channel inventory. But let me just speak to you in a little broader term about our guidance. We factored a number of considerations into developing our guidance. Our first, then, this really was your first question, Q1 spanned 14 weeks, and Q2 will span a normal 13 weeks. And again the 14th week that we had this quarter was the week between Christmas and New Year which is a very strong, sharp shopping week. Second, for our Mac business, we have factored in the very strong response that weâve received for the new Intel-based Mac that we announced at Mac World, the limited number of shipping weeks that we will have on the MacBook Pro and the positives that we saw in customer demand for Q1. For the iPods we have factored the extraordinary demand in Q1 which was fueled by iPods being one of the top holiday gifts of the season, some channel fill that we had and the seasonal drop in demand as we go from holiday quarter to the March quarter.",1
Did you say channel inventory for iPods were within the range or even at the low end?,1
They were within the range but maybe iâll let Tim make some comments on both Mac and iPod inventory.,1
"On iPod channel inventory, as it has been widely reported in number places, our channel inventories were lower than we would have liked, for most of the quarter. Shipments did improve on iPod across the quarter, in particular in the second half of December, the shipments were very strong. With the strong shipments, the total channel inventory which included a significant amount of inventory that was in transit at the end of the quarter increased by approximately 550,000 units as compared to the channel inventory at the beginning of the quarter. Despite that the ending channel inventory was still below the target range of 4-6 weeks based December sales. However we believe that the channel inventory is within our targeted range of 4-6 weeks, based on our current view of demand for the seasonally lower March quarter. In terms of the Mac channel inventory, we began the quarter below the targeted range of 4-5 weeks, and as we had planned we ended the quarter below the targeted range in preparation for the Mac World announcements that we made last week.",1
"Okay. Tim, i am going speed it for one more, the â just, i see a situation where you still may have some lower than expected channel inventory but, may be now are you seeing anything out there that is giving you any pause in the economy or in the consumer markets other than some of these Apple related events that you are talking about?",1
"What we are seeing is, we had extraordinary response last week to our announcements at Mac World, we are thrilled with the reactions that weâve got including the bookings on the new iMac and the PowerBook, our MacBook Pro, the last quarter we did see a pause as some customers began to speculate about the upcoming announcements at Mac World however, the Mac beat our internal expectations as Peter just said, we obviously factored some level of pause into our guidance and we were able to beat that number and we are happy with that and the overall moment of the Mac business.",1
"Just kindly of looking at the Opex guidance, it is now basically inline with your sales guidance, i know you donât give a target model anymore but historically you used to try to keep that tracking at about 50% of the growth of sales, how should we be thinking about that, do you need to be spending this much if top line growth is going to be slowing like this?",1
"Ben, I would characterize it as a big week.",1
"We, as I said we are very confident in our business, in our strategy and we are continuing to invest for long term growth, both in revenue and in earnings. Iâve provided very strong guidance for the March quarter with revenue growing at 33% and double digit operating margin.",1
"I guess one follow up on the Mac question. Obviously you have had a strong response for the new product, does this mean you are very scared about iBook and PowerBook sales really deteriorating until those two new products are launched as well?",1
"We did see a pause quarter as Peter has said we have factored what we saw last quarter, end of the quarters guidance, we are thrilled with the response that we got last week and as we said we started shipments of the iMac already and given that weâve got an entire to ship it, we believe we can, we are hopeful that we can meet the demand on the iMac. But also as we announced last week, the MacBook Pro will begin shipping in February and therefore has a limited number of weeks to ship during the quarter, given that and the very strong response that we saw, we may not be able to meet the demand on the MacBook Pro.",1
"Thanks Rob, could we have the next question please.",1
"Obviously phenomenal quarter, just wanted to dig down a little bit more on the CPU side of the equation, you have reported several times the fact that you saw a pause, since that was the one area where some people could say, they were disappointed on the December results. Can you just provide a little bit more specificity in terms of what you saw that gives you a confident that this is purely a pause in front of the product cycle as compared to any disconnect on the âHalo Effect ? that many people have?",1
"Let me make some comments. First of all the Mac business grew 20% year-over-year and it did exceed our internal expectations which had factored again at a level upon. We did see a pause, weâve received reports from a number of customer from different markets that they were postponing purchases tending Mac World announcements, however in our results last week that we saw in the reaction last week is extraordinary and that gives us tremendous optimism about the customer reaction and on the Intel based Macintosh. It is very difficult to predict how customers will react this quarter. And so obviously factored in a that kind of thinking into our guidance. A year ago we had a situation as you recall the comparison of the quarter where we had, a significant shortage of G5 chip in the September quarter and then we began to fill the channel and serve the pent-up demand as we entered the December quarter. And so the comparison frankly is also a difficult comparison. That has to be taken to consideration as well and looking at the year-over-year results.",1
"Then with regard to your outlook, I mean can you just tell us a little more about what you are expecting with the Intel transition, I mean, you are coming off a quarter where you guided 4.7, you are coming in at 5.75, I mean, now you are at 4.3, shouldnât we assume, why are being so conservative, a little more detail on this exact Intel transition issue, would be helpful, may be even if you can go back to the weeks of inventory and what you might expect further drain or anything else.",1
Okay. I mean is it possible to say like it added a million or 2 million iPods or is it just too hard to say?,1
The 4gig is lean in places that we are working very hard to get those gigs NANOs out there.,1
The Apple Retail stores reached a significant new milestone in the December quarter by generating $1.072 billion in revenue compared to $561 million in the year-ago quarter. We opened 11 new stores during the quarter exiting with a 135. With an average of 129 stores opened during the quarter average quarterly revenue per store was $8.3 million up 41% from the year-ago quarter. Retail segments profits grew sharply to $90 million from $45 million in the year-ago quarter. And associated manufacturing margin not reflected in retail segment profit with a $199 million up from $99 million in the year-ago quarter. We are particularly proud of the moment we have realized in our stores. With fiscal 2004 after 3 years of operation we generated $1.185 billion in annual revenue through the stores. In fiscal 2005 we nearly doubled that number $2.35 billion. Now in a single quarter we have surpassed $1 billion in revenue. We will continue to add new stores at a measured pace and expect to open a total of 40 new stores during fiscal of â06.,1
"Good afternoon. Thanks for everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Appleâs CFO Peter Oppenheimer and he will be joined by Appleâs COO Timothy (Tim) Cook and corporate treasurer Gary Whistler for Q&A session with analyst. Please note that some of the information you will here during this call consists of forward looking statements regarding revenue gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes earnings per share, Appleâs retail initiative, iPod shipments, future products including Intel based Mac, component prepayments and non-cash stock based compensation expense. Actual results and trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information please refer to the risk factors contained in the companyâs Form 10-K for 2005. Please also note that any non-GAAP financial measures included in todayâs call should be viewed in addition to and not in lue of Appleâs GAAP results. A reconciliation of any GAAP and non-GAAP measures discussed will be posted on Appleâs website at www.apple.com/investor. I would like to remind you that the second quarter of Appleâs fiscal 2006 will end on April 1st and will span 13 weeks rather the 14 weeks spanned by the first fiscal quarter. In connection with SEC rules on corporate disclosure Apple is making this analyst call open to the media and general public by broadcasting the call live over the internet. With that i would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.",1
"Peter Oppenheimer, CFO",1
"Thank for joining us. We are extremely proud to report a tremendous first quarter for Apple. Revenue of $5.75 billion increased over $2 billion from last quarterâs record revenue and was up 65% year-over-year. This quarterly results also exceeded Appleâs revenue for all of fiscal 2002. The quarterâs revenue was fueled by record shattering iPod sales, solid Mac sales and 14th week of business during the quarter. Quarterly net income nearly doubled on a year-over-year basis and also widely eclipsed the previous record established in the September quarter. Based on an unusually strong operating margin of 13% net income was $565 million or $0.65 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of non-cash stock based compensation operating margin was 13.8%, net income was $595 million and diluted earnings per shares was $0.68. I will now provide highlights of our two businesses, Mac and Music. Our Mac business generated 41% of total revenue which was up 12% from the year-ago quarter. Mac shipments increased 20% year-over-year to $1.254 million the highest quarterly total in six years.",1
"We continued to experience strong portable system sales. We shipped the combined total of 587,000 iBooks and PowerBooks representing 39% year-over-year growth. We shipped 667,000 Desktops systems representing 7% year-over-year growth. Mac unit sales exceeded our internal expectations despite of what we believe was a positive sale associated with the Intel transition. Reflecting on the September and December quarters, we were pleased with the lower than expected impact at the Intel transition on sales and with the moment of our Mac business. Our ending channel inventory remain below our target of 4-5 weeks as planned due to our Intel based Macintosh announced at Mac World.",1
"Our Music business generated 59% of total Apple revenue in the quarter and was up 145% compared to the year-ago quarter. We sold over 14 million iPods during the quarter, more than three times the number we sold in the year-ago quarter and more than double the previous record number of iPods we sold in the September quarter. We are particularly proud of our execution given that we replaced two of our three iPod lines including the highest volume iPod Mini line as we entered the holiday season. Customer reactions about the iPod Nano and the 5th generation iPod.",1
"IPod channel inventories were lower than we would have liked during the quarter. At the end of the quarter including units in transit our channel inventory levels were within our 4-6 weeks target range based on our current US demand for the seasonally lower March quarter. It was a landmark quarter for the iTunes music store with the addition of television, music video and short term content to the storeâs vast and growing library of music and audio books. The iTunes music store continues to be the worldâs leading online music service and currently operates in 21 countries that represent over 90% of the global music market. We have sold over 850 million songs and 8 million videos to date. And according to Nielsen Sound Scan Apple accounted for 83% share of the US market of legally purchased and downloaded music during the month of December.",1
"In terms of geographic results including sales from our retail stores quarterly revenue in Japan, the Americas and Europe was up year-over-year by 92%, 70% and 51% respectively. Gross margin was 27.2% on a GAAP basis and included $5 million in expense related to non-cash stock based compensation. Without this expense non-GAAP gross margin would have been 27.3%. GAAP operating expenses were $814 million including $39 million in expense related to stock based compensation.",1
"Let me answer your first question. Yes, the 14th week this year, did span between Christmas day and New Yearâs day and that is traditionally and it is was year, a very strong shopping week, and our earnings expenses and revenue were all higher as a result.",1
"Non-GAAP Opex was $775 million $55 million higher than our guidance primarily due to variable expenses associated with the higher revenue level, a greater than expected mix of direct sales and investments we made in our business. OYME (ph) was $81 million and the tax rate was 32%. Cash grew by $446 million during the quarter to $8.707 billion. We made prepayment of $750 million related to previously announced agreements for future supply of NAND Flash memory components. Without these prepayments cash would have increased by about $1.2 billion. The cash generation was primarily a function of strong earnings, excellent working capital management and employee stock option exercises.",1
Cash flow from operations during the quarter was about $283 million which includes the impact of a $750 million prepayments. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $82 million including $40 million for our retail initiative. Looking ahead for the March quarter i would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. Quarter-to-quarter which will span a fiscal 13 rather than 14 weeks we are targeting the second best quarter in the companyâs history second only to the last quarter with revenues of about $4.3 billion. This target represents 33% year-over-year growth and an increase of over $1 billion year-over-year. We are factoring into our guidance a seasonal decline in iPods in the beginning of our transition of Intel based Mac. We expect the total quarterly cost of non-cash stock based compensation to be approximately $49 million. We expect GAAP gross margins to be about 27.8% reflecting approximately $5 million related to stock based compensation expense. Without that expense we expect non-GAAP gross margins to be about 27.9%. We expect GAAP Opex to be about $774 million including about $44 million related to stock based compensation. We expect non-GAAP Opex to be about $730 million. We expect OYME (ph) to be $72 million and we expect the tax rate to be 32%. We expect to generate GAAP EPS of about $0.38 which includes an anticipated $0.4 per share related to non-cash share based compensation expense. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be about $0.42.,1
"During the March quarter, we expect to pay the remaining the $500 million of the $1.25 billion NAND Flash repayment. We just completed the best quarter in Appleâs history, and fiscal â06 is off to a great start. Our new Intel based Mac announced at Mac World has been very well received. We remain extremely enthusiastic about our innovative product pipeline and we are confident in our strategy. With that I would like to open the call for questions.",1
Questions And Answers,1
Thank you Operator Instructions Our first question comes from Benjamin Reitzes of UBS.,1
"A couple of things, Peter do you â are you able to quantify the impact of the extra week, I believe last year you did not have the week after Christmas, this year you did, and so was this yearâs extra week extra big or is it really hard to say and then I just wanted to ask more about your guidance, so it would be great if you can just answer.",1
You specifically like to talk about specific products anymore but would you atleast confirm that more of the slowdown happened on the professional side of the equation as opposed to the consumer side of the equation? Or is there another trend that you saw?,1
"We had some level of reports from customers in different markets, i wouldnât want to pin it on one market above the other.",1
"Thanks Rebecca, could we have the next question please.",1
"Thanks Shannon, could we have the next question please.",1
"Can you give us an idea in terms of availability of components from Intel and specifically is that leading to any delays in terms of getting the MacBook Pro out? Just specifics, you said February, it is earlier rather than later in the month?",1
"Let me answer the question broadly about the supply of the iMac and the MacBook Pro. Weâve begin to ship the iMac, we are very happy with how the production ramp is going. We are extremely happy with the response we had last week as iâve said before, and we are hopeful that we could meet the demand for the quarter. On the MacBook Pro as planned we are beginning to ship that in February and given the number of weeks that would remain in the quarter to ship and the extraordinary response that weâve seen with our customers we may not be able to meet demand on that product.",1
"And with regard to any product constraints in the last quarter, any thoughts on air freighting, any incremental cost that were associated with any shortages?",1
"In the current quarter, that factored into our guidance we would be airfreighting the Intel based iMac in order to get those into customers hands very quickly. We are also in the results in our Q1 that has Peter has talked to airfreighted some number of iMacs as we had rose the multiple line up in October.",1
"Okay. And then finally, can you give us an idea of how many outlets, you are now selling iPods in?",1
We are over 35000 at this point although we do not sell all models in all outlets.,1
Joel Wagonfeld of First Albany Capital.,1
The next question comes from Bill Shope of J.P.Morgan.,1
"Two part question, if i could. 1) is there any chance the new iMac and the PowerBook have better gross margins given the scale of the Intel Eco system for other parts of the component. 2) is it accurate of the impact of any price protection that you may have incorporated for plan discounts of the legacy G5 and G4 Mac, with that already be incorporated in the December quarter and hence that would negatively impact this March quarter and finally i just wanted to be clear, are you saying that with your comments on the inventory that the supply and demand are now in balance for all of the iPods includes the NANO 4gig?",1
"Let is answer your first two questions and Tim can address your third. As regards the Intel based Mac gross margins we donât to provide specific gross margins for any of our products, i have given you pretty detailed guidance for the December quarter. And i am sorry what was your second question?",1
"The impact of any price protection, that would have already been incorporated last quarter?",1
"As i had earlier mentioned we are not going to talk about product plans or pricing actions that we have not already have announced but i can tell you that any price protection that would effect our channel inventory that contemplate, we provided for in our December quarter and in future action beyond that, would not affect the channel inventory but March quarter is down in, we have factored into our guidance for the March quarter.",1
"Relative to the channel inventory on iPod on an aggregate basis, we believe that we are within our targeted range of 4-6 weeks based on our current of view of demand for the quarter however, there are stock out in different places on different models and also some countries are leaner than others. We are working very very hard right now, to alleviate this situation.",1
is the 4gig still the key bottleneck?,1
Shannon Cross of Cross Research,1
"Thanks Charlie, could we have the next question please.",1
"Yeah. Charlie that is 3 million per day, not 3 million per week for clarity.",1
"Yes. In the december quarter we sold a lot of iTunes Music gift cards and certificates over the store but we were also having people purchase directly as well, and we couldnât have been happier with the sales of iTunes in the December quarter.",1
"Okay. Let me ask the final question then. At the Mac World keynote last week, Steve indicated that music downloads were running at 3 million per week, i believe, i assume that that level was reached through a lot of redemptionâs of gift certificates, is that a reasonable assumption?",1
"Charlie, as i have indicated in Billâs question, we donât want to talk about iPod sales by model or geography. I can tell you that with 14 million sold last quarter, we were thrilled with that result and there were points in the quarter where we were too low in our many of our channels.",1
"Okay. What was the split between iPod sales, domestic versus international?",1
"Charlie, i am sorry, i donât have that.",1
Yes. I have few questions. What was expressed on Apple Store Mac sales between Windows and Mac users?,1
Charles Wolf of Needham & Company.,1
"Thanks Bill, could we have the next question please.",1
"Sure. As you know i donât want to be, for competitive reasons specific in what we want to talk about, specific iPod sales, but i will tell you that the iPod gross margins in the December quarter were above 20%.",1
One final question. Can you give us read on margins for the iPod business for the quarter?,1
"We recognize shipment of our products in most cases, when they are shipped from our factories.",1
"Okay. Just a clarification on the in-transit inventory that you included in your channel inventory number, that is not recognized as revenue yet. You donât recognize until it actually arrived at the retailer or is that incorrect?",1
"We donât Bill, talk about future products or future pricing but we certainly factored our thinking into our guidance and we will continue to ship the iMac G5 and the PowerBook 15 inch wealth of iBook.",1
"First of all, on your website you are still offering the iMac G5, obviously the PowerMac G4. They are at the same price as the new Intel based Mac, that you highlighted at Mac World. Can you give us an idea of how much inventory you are still need to work through for the legacy products and also help us understand how you work through that inventory without discounting?",1
"On your second question, on the creative professional we saw good growth in the video market on a year-over-year basis, we were very pleased with it, DNP was weak and if it is as you know the DNP market itself is not a hugely growing market, it is just that not out of our expectation though by any means. In terms of opportunities on the iPod, we see iPod as the absolute best player in the market. We only recently announced the iPod Nano and the iPod, there is more video content on the way with the iPod and so i think there continues to be significant opportunity for the iPod in the overall music business.",1
"Thanks Steve, could we have the next question please.",1
We have a follow-up question from Benjamin Reitzes of UBS.,1
"The second question goes to the gross margin question again, just in terms of better understanding the sustainable leverage, taking away the commodity environment and the mix environment, which will clearly cycle. You are seeing tremendous leverage in the business. Is there any reason why that is not sustainable? As we think longer-term and go out say a year from now and look at next December, where if we expect growth in the business, we should be thinking and contemplating what the operating leverage looks like. I know that going quarter to quarter, you are not going to see that same sort of leverage, but as we think longer term, how much of the gross margin leverage that you experienced in the quarter is sustainable? How meaningful was that really in this past December?",1
We will go next now to Rebecca Runkle at Morgan Stanley.,1
"Great, thanks. Two quick questions. First one, Peter and Tim, just goes to the Mac units in the quarter. Obviously you are taking share and you had a great quarter, but if I look sequentially, you saw units drop in the U.S. and in retail. Will you put some color behind that? Was that channel fill? What were the drivers there that caused that sequential drop?",1
"Rebecca, if you look at the Americas as an entity, and you combine the retail result, the Mac units sequentially were down 16%. That is exactly the sequential decline the previous year, and frankly it is the decline about every year. We have an extremely strong educational business in the Q4 period that includes substantial institutional business, and that institutional business corrects significantly as we get into Q1.",1
"So the sequential decline that we saw is something that is very seasonal in nature. Frankly, we were very happy to overall have the same number of total Macs that we had in Q4, because we expected that given the high level of institutional sales, including two very large one-to-ones that total 50,000 units, we had predicted the Mac to be down from Q4, and it is not. As Peter said in the preamble that, combined with the staggering demand on iPod, allowed us to overachieve our revenue guidance.",1
"Another way of interpreting that though, if I am understanding correctly, is that your share gains in institutional are pacing about the same rate as your share gains within the U.S. consumer and the holiday buying season patterns that we saw. Youâre not seeing that shift on a year-over-year basis, that sequential pattern. You are not seeing that shift, so that would suggest that your share gain --",1
"Keep in mind that last yearâs sequential pattern included a 14-week Q1, and so to have about the same sequential results is actually a very, very positive point.",1
"Rebecca, while I am guiding to 29.5% for the March quarter, over the longer term, I would continue to target gross margin in the 27% to 28% range, despite our recent results, which have benefited from several factors, including a favorable commodity environment. Looking forward, we are likely to see other factors that will drive gross margin down, such as a different commodity environment or product mix.",1
"Great, and then just a follow-up on the iPod side. Can you give us a general idea -- you used to give some of the information about where the iPod gross margin is. Could you help us understand maybe how that is varying from where it used to be?",1
"How much of the leverage in the December quarter, or how much of the gross margin differential from your guidance was driven off of leverage? Is that a third of the up-side?",1
"I did not calculate it that way. It helped us, but I would say the bigger drivers were the favorable commodity environment and the product mix.",1
"Great, thanks a lot, Peter.",1
"Thanks, Rebecca. Could we have the next question, please?",1
We will go next now to Keith Bachman at Banc of America.,1
"I have two guys, if I could, for both of you I think on the first one. International sales, is there any way to give us some color on the international sales? In particular, Europe looked pretty good, and the flavor between iPods and CPUs. iPods have in the past few years been traditionally ahead of U.S. orientation. Is that expanding significantly? In other words, was a lot of the upside in your iPod you think driven by sales outside of the U.S.? Is there any color you can give us there on the international sales?",1
"Well, as you know, we have a longstanding practice of not releasing specific product gross margins. However, the corporate gross margin was over 31%, exceeding our gross margin guidance and iPod was key in achieving this.",1
"As Peter said, we grew at three times the market. Underneath that, if you look in some specific markets, like the U.S., we grew at 31% versus market growth of 3%, which is substantially above. Portables grew at 65% versus IDCâs forecast at 23%. This is also now eight of the last nine quarters that the Mac has outgrown the market, so I do not see -- I believe we have very, very competitive product offerings that are delivering substantially above market growth. We have no reason to change.",1
"Good afternoon again and couple of things, just caught me a little off guard, it was pretty quick. With regards to other music at 491 much better than expected. I am just wondering, was there anything in there, that that particularly helpful meaning you are seeing a lot of extra shells now iPod accessories in many retailers, maybe if you are able to kind of talk to how much iPod accessories were in that number and what is going on with the iPod Eco system going forward so that we can model that line a little better.",1
We go next now to Richard Farmer at Merrill Lynch.,1
"We were very pleased with the storesâ performance. They are bringing many new customers to Apple and we think come June, they will sell a lot of iPhones.",1
"Secondly, just to clarify your channel inventory comments, I am having trouble reconciling them. At the end of last quarter, you said iPod inventory, I gather on a consistent, look-forward basis, was in your range of four to six weeks. You are basically guiding for iPod revenues to be down more than 40%, units to be down more than 40% sequentially. So if your units are going to effectively be half and your inventory actually went up on a sequential basis, the number of units, and you were between four and six, how is it possible that you are not at least eight weeks of channel inventory at the end of this quarter on a look-forward basis?",1
"The difference between the beginning on-hand and the ending on-hand last quarter in the iPod space was only 200,000 units, so it was a very, very small increase and all of that was due to the Shuffle, which did not start shipping until October. So because we think demand will be higher than in Q4, which is the previous four to six week period, we are still within four to six on a look-forward basis in the January quarter.",1
"Sorry, can you run that by me again? At the end of fiscal Q4, I thought on a look-forward basis you were four to six weeks on what will be double the volume. So if at the end of Q1 on a look-forward basis, you are still four to six weeks, then your volumes looking forward are going to be half, yet your inventory went up. How is that possible?",1
The four to six weeks that you are quoting in Q4 was looking back. It was a backwards looking four to six weeks.,1
"Obviously, if you looked at, if we did a look-back basis on Q1, Tony, it would be one to two weeks. It would be a very, very small level of inventory, but that is an unrealistic number because we have inventory for forward sales.",1
"Thanks. Peter and Tim, I would like to ask about the operating leverage and of the margins in the quarter. The operating margin was 18.6%, a lot higher than most of us were modeling. Gross margins as well, 31%, higher than expected. I guess the question is how sustainable do you think that kind of operating leverage is? I heard a few comments about the commodity environment and the leverage of the fixed expense, but is it reasonable to think that margins can go higher from here with more growth? Or are you planning to make decisions to reinvest more aggressively in pricing or other things in a way that would reduce those margins more than a normalized amount?",1
"Great, thank you very much. Just a question on the Mac side. You saw a pretty good sequential up-tick in the ASP, and I was wondering if you were starting to think about maybe pricing a little more aggressively to accelerate Mac growth even more going forward?",1
"I will start and Tim may want to add a few comments. We were thrilled with the operating margin in the quarter at 18.6%, but as I said in my prepared remarks, it was exceptionally high, driven by gross margin of 31%, which is well above where we have been operating and our target range, and was certainly positively influenced by the record revenue of over $7.1 billion, so do not get used to 18% operating margins.",1
"With the guidance that I have provided for the March quarter, we have effectively guided to slightly over a 12% operating margin.",1
"Richard, I would just add to that that as you know, commodity markets cycle and we realize that right now we are on a very favorable cycle, but we would never project that to continue in the long-term.",1
"Okay, and then just a follow-up, if I could, on the iPhone. You decided not to support 3G in the first prototype model. Could you talk about your thinking there? How quickly could that change over time?",1
"At this point, we are very much sold on the 2.5 for the edge network with Cingular, because it is much more widespread and widely deployed in the U.S. We do not comment on our roadmaps, et cetera, but obviously we would be where the technology is over time.",1
We will go now to David Bailey at Goldman Sachs.,1
"Keith, if you look at Europe in particular, the Mac unit growth in Europe was 28%, and that compares to a market growth of 9%, so they were also over three times the market.",1
"We did grow iPod sales faster outside the United States, which was our goal, if you recall. As Peter talked about in his opening remarks, we had several countries that did exceptional. We now have five countries that are above 50% -- and this is in addition to the United States -- the U.K., Switzerland, Canada, Australia, and Japan. If you look at some of the other countries that we put significant attention to from an advertising point of view and a channel development point of view, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, Denmark -- all gains between 10 and 20 points of share.",1
"We feel very, very good about how we did on both the Mac and the iPod internationally, particularly in Europe.",1
"It was slightly down, yes. Again, as a result of our expanded channel and our supply and demand being in balance this year, where that wasn't the case last year.",1
I can get that for later.,1
"Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks.",1
We go now to Harry Blount of Lehman Brothers.,1
"Thanks. Tim, just real quickly, on the number of distribution locations for the iPod, and then for the Mac?",1
"For iPod, we're at 40,000. For the Mac, we're at 7,500.",1
"Just to clarify Peter, on a comment you made earlier, I think you said iPod revenue was lower within the Apple stores on a year-over-year basis. Is that also true on a unit basis?",1
"Just to clarify something on the gross margin side of the equation. If I look at retail being up -- about 11% by the looks of it -- and if I take a look at the mix shift here between iPod and Mac, how could we not conclude, in effect, that the gross margins on the iPod line are not as good now -- or better than -- what they are in the PC line?",1
"My follow-on question, Peter, when answering Rebeccaâs questions on your intention of the gross margin, the iPhone is out. It is announced. Will the gross margin on the iPhone be at, better or worse than the corporate average? Is there any color you could give us there? In the past, you have given us a little bit of color as youâve introduced new products.",1
"Well, again, we don't comment specifically on product gross margins, but as I commented before, iPod certainly played a role in the gross margin achievement that we had in the quarter at 30%, which was above our guidance.",1
"The last questions relate to the channel, your indication of 200,000 units increase in channel inventory. I just want to make sure, from an understanding perspective, that includes all of the iPod units that are resident at all of your 40,000 distribution points?",1
We'll go to Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns.,1
"Sure. Just two things, if I could.",1
"One, I just wanted to clarify in terms of where you are in terms of -- this is an iPhone question --is the design fixed? In the sense that one of the questions people have asked about is the battery being sealed. Is what you see what you get, and is there any consideration towards changing that?",1
"Andy, we'll provide more details on the iPhone right before we begin shipping in June.",1
"Okay, that is fine. I can dig it out.",1
"Our average store revenue in the quarter was $6.7 million, and I do not have last yearâs in front of me.",1
For retail?,1
"Okay, and then my final question, not sure if this was already addressed, but can you give us a read on same-store sales growth for the quarter?",1
"I do not see anything related to a pause, relative to Leopard. If you look back at Tiger, we saw no pause related to a new operating system.",1
And then the question on the pause potentially ahead of the Leopard launch?,1
"Relative to Best Buy and more generally, expansion of the Mac channel, we are continuing to selectively expand the Mac channel. We now have around 7500 storefronts around the world. That increased about 1500 across the year. Best Buy in particular, as I mentioned on the last conference call, we had increased about 50 stores during the holiday quarter and we will be working with Best Buy this quarter to evaluate those and conclude what our next steps are.",1
"Great, thanks. First of all, could you give us an update on the Best Buy pilot and how that fared during the quarter? Secondarily, I am not sure if you have this data, but if you have any surveys or do any work during the quarter to see if there was any evidence that maybe some customers are pausing on Mac purchases ahead of the Leopard launch?",1
We go next now to Bill Shope of J.P. Morgan.,1
Nothing to share with you today.,1
"Okay, and one final question. Last year, well, actually in â05, there was a stock split, about $80. Just curious on your thoughts, I donât know, Peter, whoever wants to take it at this point in time.",1
We continue to plan to ship Leopard in the spring as we had announced at the developerâs conference. We have a lot of people working on it.,1
"Okay, and then my second question is just with regard to Leopard. We did not get much on Leopard at Macworld. Obviously you had a bit more to announce at that point in time. Anything you can give us on Leopard in terms of color at this point in time?",1
"As you know, we do not release specific units within the iPod family, but I would tell you that all three models did exceptionally well.",1
"Good afternoon. Just two questions, one with regard to the product mix. Could you give us just a little more clarity, possibly within the iPod side of it, just in terms of where you saw the demand? Obviously shuffles were strong with the ASPs, but anything more you can give us there? Just trying to sort of get a read through to gross margin contribution for each one of them.",1
We will go next now to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"As you know, we do not plan to ship the iPhone until June. Consistent with our longstanding practice, we do not provide product level gross margins, but the guidance that I will give you in April for the June quarter certainly will comprehend our anticipated iPhone shipments.",1
"Sure, Toni. The retail store revenue, as you said, grew 6% year over year as total Mac sales increased by 60%. This was partially offset by lower iPod revenue, which resulted from the price reductions that we took in September, and also our expanded and well-supplied distribution channel that we had this year. That was really the cause of it.",1
"Yes, thank you. I have two questions. The storesâ revenue collectively was up only 6%, despite the fact that CPU growth was up 60% and revenue was likely up 70%, implying a dramatic deceleration year over year in iPod unit shipments in the stores. Could you comment on why that happened? What we have been seeing, pretty well through history, is the stores have always grown faster than Apple overall. I think other than the Intel transition, this was the only time in history where that has not occurred. That clearly seems attributable to the iPod. Could you take me through why that might be?",1
We go next now to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.,1
Did you know that relatively unknown elements inside iPods are surging in price and will help you profit from the unstoppable consumer electronics trend over the next 5 years?,1
"Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our presentations for today.",1
"Thanks so much for holding, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to this Apple first quarter financial results conference call. Just a reminder, todayâs conference is being recorded. And now at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, Madam.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Appleâs CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, and he will be joined by Apple COO Tim Cook and Apple Treasurer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&A session with analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, earnings per share, future products, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast, and for more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2006 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release.",1
Avalon Ventures Logo,1
"Apple sold over 40,000,000 iPods in 2006. Shareholders are happy.",1
"Enter Rare Earth Elements called lithium and neodymium. Without them, iPods, MP3 Players and other consumer electronics could not operate. As a result, demand for the lithium ion battery market is far out-weighing supply. We can say the same for neodymium, a metal used in magnets that find their way into the small hard drive inside every iPod.",1
Portable Mac shipments during the quarter grew 65% year over year and accounted for 60% of total Macs sold.,1
How can you profit from this trend? Buy resource companies specializing in Rare Earth Metals.,1
"Enter Avalon Ventures Ltd., well-positioned to profit from the new demand for rare metals from the consumer electronics industry through its large rare earth projects, including the worldâs largest undeveloped resource of the rare lithium mineral petalite. If you believe in the future of consumer electronics, take a look into Avalon Ventures, or our official online Investor Relations HUB.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report stellar financial results and another record-breaking quarter for Apple. The quarterâs revenue was $7.12 billion, representing 24% growth over the prior December quarterâs record results, which included a 14th week.",1
"The revenue growth was driven by very strong iPod sales during the holiday season and continued robust demand for Macs. Operating margin for the quarter was exceptionally high at 18.6%, resulting from the revenue growth and effective cost management. We are particularly proud to have generated net income of $1 billion, which is up 78% over last yearâs record December quarter results, and translated to earnings per share of $1.14.",1
"I would like to first talk abut our Mac products and services, which represented 43% of our total quarterly revenue. We shipped a total of 1.61 million Macs, consistent with the record-setting shipment in our September back-to-school quarter, and representing 28% growth over the 14-week year-ago quarter. We were very pleased with this growth, which was ahead of our expectations and represented about three times IDCâs latest published market growth rate estimate for the December quarter.",1
"Ending channel inventory of Macs was essentially unchanged from the prior quarter, and was just below our target range of four to five weeks.",1
"Okay. Thanks. Gene and thanks to everyone for joining us. A recording of todayâs call will be available for replay via telephone for seven days beginning at 5:00 PM pacific time today.

Q - Piper Jaffray,1
And a follow-up from Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray.,1
Mine has been answered. Thanks a lot.,1
Q - Rebecca Runkle,1
We have follow-up question from Rebecca Runkle. Please go ahead.,1
"I guess, you are helping. Okay thanks a lot.",1
We donât give unit level guidance on the product.,1
"I mean, is that like million of units, tracking type of device in the future, that kind of subset of iPod sales, is that the potential where we are looking at. Like a higher attach rate?",1
"We are very pleased with the response on it Ben, and we are working very hard to get units out. We are currently not meeting demand but we are working really hard to try to do it. I am not projecting whether we can or not, for the full quarter at this point.",1
Okay. And you can meet demand.,1
Well.,1
"That radio tuner, any early indications on how that is doing.",1
Yes. Announced at Mac World. Yes.,1
"Well, will that line where we see the new radio tuner, i believe?",1
"Ben, the two largest component of the other music related products and services are first the iTunes music store and then the iPod accessories, both the Apple branded that we sell both directly and indirectly and the developer iPod accessories that we sell through the Apple online and retail stores. Both had significant growth year-over-year and sequentially the music store, we couldnât be happier with itâs performance as indicated earlier, we are serving customers in 21 countries, where over 90% of music is purchased. And we saw just strong growth both year-over-year and sequentially not only in music but with the addition of video and we look forward to bringing more content both here in the United States and in other places before too long. The accessories business continues to grow for us both in terms of the Apple branded and our developers support. We are now have over 2000 accessories that you can buy with your iPod, the vast majority that Apple doesnât make. And as i said we are beginning to see a bit more of a recurring revenue stream there where people are coming and adding back, that next accessory to their iPod family.",1
"We refreshed both the MacBook and MacBook Pro with Intel Core 2 Dual processors during the quarter, and customer demand for our portable Macs remained particularly strong.",1
"It was an outstanding quarter for our music products and services. They accounted for 57% of total revenue during the quarter versus 59% in the year-ago quarter. We sold 21.1 million iPods, representing 50% growth over the year-ago quarter. The new iPod Shuffle began shipping at the end of October and we were very pleased with the demand for all three of our iPod product lines during the quarter.",1
"Sure, Rich. This is Tim. Last quarter, we saw favorable pricing across the board. It was a great time to be a buyer. For this quarter, we see that favorable pricing environment continuing on LCDs and Flash memory, and we believe that DRAM will be relatively supply/demand balanced.",1
"For Macs, Apple does a significant percentage of its December quarter in the consumer segment and sequentially, we would expect to see the holiday buying season drop off and the education buying to begin to ramp up in the spring.",1
"In closing, fiscal year 2007 is off to a tremendous start. We are incredibly proud to have just completed the first quarter with revenue of over $7 billion and net income of $1 billion. Last week at MacWorld, we introduced the revolutionary iPhone and Apple TV and we are very excited about the remarkable new products coming from Apple this year.",1
We go first today to Mr. Ben Reitzes with UBS.,1
"Thanks, good afternoon. Peter, in your guidance, what are you factoring in, or are you factoring anything in, for any pause in demand ahead of the iPhone, perhaps in the iPod markets or anything? Also, what are you factoring in for seasonality in the iPod market?",1
"We have factored our view of customer demand and supply into our guidance. As we have said, we just announced the iPhone last week and it is really too soon to tell, but we believe we have a great iPod product offering today, with a range of prices, capacities and form factors to meet many customers needs and uses. We may be in a position to share some observations with you next quarter.",1
"In terms of seasonality from December to the March quarter, let me speak first about iPods and then I will make some comments about Mac.",1
"For iPods, in terms of assessing the MP3 market seasonality, we have learned over the last few years that what really drives the MP3 market to new levels is innovative product launches and the holiday season buying in the December quarter. iPod demand this quarter was extraordinary. We were able to ship over 21 million units. Unlike the previous year, iPod supply and demand were largely in balance. Given this, we would expect a higher seasonal decline from the December quarter to the March quarter this year than we saw last.",1
"One last thing is just with regard to your stock option investigation. Have you received any commentary from the SEC or Justice Department? Are they happy with your findings? What do you expect to hear from them now, if anything?",1
"Channel inventory of iPods increased by about 200,000 units, all related to channel fill for the iPod Shuffle. We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks on a look-forward basis.",1
"We from the beginning have voluntarily and proactively provided all details of our internal review and the independent investigation to the SEC and the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California. The exhaustive and independent investigation found no misconduct by any member of Apple's current management team, and the Board has expressed complete confidence in the management team.",1
"Okay, and so they still have no formal investigation and what not, and no comments from them, or else you would have to share them, correct?",1
We are continuing to voluntarily and proactively inform them of our findings and answer their questions.,1
"Great, thanks, Peter.",1
We go next now to Mr. Richard Gardner with Citigroup.,1
"Thank you. Peter, you mentioned a very favorable commodity environment when you did your gross margin discussion. Could you talk about which commodities in particular were more favorable than expected in the quarter? Could you give, Tim, please, your typical supply/demand outlook for the March quarter as well? Thank you.",1
"We expect to generate EPS of about $0.54 to $0.56, including an anticipated $0.05 per share related to non-cash, share-based compensation expense.",1
We expect OI&E to be about $130 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 32%; and,1
"We expect op-ex to be about $845 million, including about $58 million related to stock-based compensation expense;",1
"We expect gross margin to be about 29.5%, reflecting approximately $8 million related to stock-based compensation expense;",1
"We expect the total quarterly cost of non-cash, stock-based compensation to be approximately $66 million;",1
We are targeting revenue of between $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion;,1
For the quarter:,1
"Looking ahead to the March quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"We had very strong cash generation during the quarter, increasing our cash balance by over $1.75 billion to end with $11.9 billion. This was primarily a function of strong earnings and working capital management.",1
"OI&E was $126 million. The tax rate for the quarter was 31%, slightly below our guidance of 32% due to the extension of the R&D tax credit associated with recent legislation. We expect the tax rate to be 32% for the remaining quarters of the fiscal year.",1
"Operating expenses were $898 million, including $40 million in expense related to stock-based compensation.",1
"Gross margin was 31.2%, almost 300 basis points higher than our guidance, primarily due to the favorable commodity pricing environment, better product mix, and greater leverage of fixed costs due to the higher-than-expected revenue.",1
"The stores sold 308,000 Macs during the quarter, representing 60% year-over-year growth. Almost 28 million people visited our stores during the quarter, representing 13,000 customers per store per week. We continue to invest in our stores to support customers and to showcase our products. The stores are a wonderful place to buy Macs today and we think they will provide customers a great experience with iPhone beginning in June.",1
"Sales from our Apple retail stores were over $1.1 billion, the highest level in the storeâs history. The stores generated $89 million of segment margin, not including $232 million of associated manufacturing profit. We opened five new stores during the quarter to end with 170 stores. With an average of 169 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $6.7 million.",1
"iTunes continues to lead the market for songs purchased and downloaded, accounting for over 85% of the U.S. market based on the latest data from Nielsen Soundscan. iTunes gift cards were immensely popular during the holiday quarter and doubled year over year.",1
"Other music revenue grew 29% year over year, fueled by very strong sales through the iTunes store. The storeâs growing content offering now includes over 4 million songs, 350 television shows, and 250 movies. As we announced last week, we have now sold over 2 billion songs and have added feature films from Paramount Pictures to our movie library.",1
"We are happy that iPod maintained its leadership position in the U.S. in the face of increased competition. Our share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was 72% in the month of December, according to NPD Techworld. iPod shipments grew even faster in international markets, which resulted in share gains in every country for which we have market data. This gives us confidence that our emphasis on advertising, channel development and improved supply in these markets has been effective.",1
"Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude todayâs presentation. We do thank everyone for your participation and have a wonderful day.",1
Good day and welcome to this Apple Incorporated Apple First Quarter Fiscal Year 2009 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.,1
"At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1
"Segment margin reached a new record of over $1.8 billion and 30.3% of retail revenue compared to $1 billion and 26.2% in the year-ago quarter. Store traffic reached new record levels with 110 million visitors compared to 76 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 45%. That translates to an average of almost 22,000 visitors per store per week, reflecting incredible interest in our stores and our products.",1
"We were also happy to announce the all-new iTunes U App last week, allowing students using iPads to have access to the world's largest catalog of free educational content, along with over 20,000 education apps and hundreds of thousands of books in the iBookstore that can be used in their school curriculum. And as of today, over 3 million copies of iTunes U App have already been downloaded.",1
"Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed 315 million cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 62 million in the December quarter. We were very pleased to launch iOS 5 and iCloud during the quarter. Customers are loving the new features of iOS 5, including Notification Center, iMessage and Reminders. And iCloud is off to a great start with more than 85 million customers signed up as of today. With iCloud, customers can store their music and photos and documents and keep their personal information and content in sync across all their devices, automatically and seamlessly.",1
"The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 550,000 apps available, including 170,000 apps specifically for iPad. We are thrilled that by the end of this month, our developers will have earned over $4 billion cumulatively from App Store sales, including over $700 million in the December quarter alone.",1
"I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which also generated record results. Revenue was $6.1 billion, an increase of 59% over the prior year. The stores experienced very strong year-over-year growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, establishing new records for all 3. iPhone sales were extremely robust, more than doubling year-over-year thanks primarily to the very successful launch of the iPhone 4S.",1
"Sales of iPad were also up significantly year-over-year, thanks to continued strength of iPad 2 and strong holiday season buying. The stores also sold 1.1 million Macs compared to 851,000 in the year-ago quarter. And about half the Macs sold in our stores during the December quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.",1
"We opened 4 new stores in the quarter, including our spectacular new store at Grand Central, as well as 3 stores in Europe, bringing us to a total of 361 stores. With an average of 358 stores open, average revenue per store was $17.1 million compared to $12 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 43%.",1
"Our EasyPay checkout process has significantly enhanced our ability to handle such high customer traffic levels. And now, with personal pick up, customers can order Macs, iPods or iPads from the Apple online store and pick up most in-stock products within 1 hour at the Apple Retail Store of their choice, making shopping for Apple products that much easier and faster.",1
"iPad is extremely popular with students, teachers and administrators as a wonderfully engaging and powerful tool for teaching and learning. Today, 1.5 million iPads are already in use in education institutions, including over 1,000 one-to-one deployments.",1
"Total company gross margin was 44.7%, which was 470 basis points higher than our guidance. About half of this difference was driven by lower commodity and other product costs. Another quarter was due to leverage on the higher revenue and some onetime items benefiting the quarter. And the remainder was due to better-than-expected mix largely from the record iPhone sales.",1
"Operating expenses were $3.36 billion, and included $357 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $137 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 25.25%.",1
"Turning to our cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $97.6 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to $81.6 billion at the end of September quarter, a sequential increase of $16 billion. About $64 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of the December quarter.",1
"Cash flow from operations was over $17.5 billion. We are actively discussing uses of our cash balance and don't have anything specific to announce today. In the meantime, we continue to be very disciplined with the cash and are not letting it burn a hole in our pockets.",1
"As we move ahead into the March quarter, which will be 13-week quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"We expect revenue to be about $32.5 billion, compared to $24.7 billion in the March quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 42%, reflecting approximately $60 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.05 billion, including about $350 million related to stock-based compensation.",1
"We were very pleased to announce iBooks 2 last week featuring iBook Textbooks to deliver educational content that is more interactive, current and portable than ever from leading publishers, including Houghton Mifflin, McGraw-Hill and Pearson, as well as thousands of independent publishers. And with iBooks Author, anyone with a Mac can create iBook textbooks, cookbooks, picture books and more, and publish them to Apple's iBook Store. And over 600,000 copies of iBooks Author have already been downloaded since last Thursday's announcement.",1
"iPad continues its unprecedented adoption in business. Nearly all of the top companies within major Fortune 500 markets including pharma, manufacturing, hospitality, consumer products, financial services, healthcare and retail are actively using iPad to improve workflows, business processes and customer engagements. We are delighted to learn how iPad enables businesses to change the way they work. Real estate agents at Coldwell Banker and Sotheby's access sales presentations and use custom iPad apps in the field. Retail chains such as Bed Bath & Beyond use iPads to deliver key business metrics on the sales floor. Wineries are using iPads in their vineyards to call up weather data and soil profiles, record quality assessments and make decisions on the spot about whether to harvest their grapes. And in this past quarter, Chinese airline, EVA, has also deployed iPads to pilots and crew for flight manuals, documentation and training.",1
"Good day, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.",1
"As we announced last month, the Mac App Store has been a great success with customers downloading over 100 million apps in less than a year. The Mac App Store offers thousands of apps in education, games, graphics and design, lifestyle, productivity, utilities and other categories, and has rapidly become a favorite shopping destination for Mac software.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2011 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. We are thrilled to report the results of a tremendous quarter, generating the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple's history. We established numerous new records during the quarter, including all-time highs for quarterly iPhone, iPad and Mac sales. We are very proud of these results and are extremely pleased with the momentum of our business.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $46.3 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 73%. The increase was fueled primarily by strong growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, and was also aided by the inclusion of a 14th week in the quarter, which we indicated previously.",1
"Operating margin was $17.3 billion, representing 37.4% of revenue. Net income was $13.1 billion, increasing 118% over the prior December quarter's results, and equaling half of the net income generated in all of fiscal 2011. The quarter's net income translated to earnings per share of $13.87.",1
"Turning to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new all-time quarterly record with sales of 5.2 million Macs, setting new records for both desktops and portables. Mac sales grew 26% year-over-year compared to IDC's latest published forecast of 0 growth for the market overall in the December quarter. While total Mac sales benefited from the 14th week, average weekly Mac sales were up strongly year-over-year across the quarter. Mac sales outgrew the market in each of our geographies with particular strength in our Asia-Pacific segment where sales were up 58% year-over-year. The increase in Mac sales was fueled by very strong growth of MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, as well as the continued strong performance of iMac. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory on a look-forward basis.",1
Moving to our music products. We sold 15.4 million iPods compared to 19.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations and iPod touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD. And iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.,1
"Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter increased by 99% year-over-year to over $9.1 billion compared to $4.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. iPad sales surpassed our expectations with sell-through exceeding sell-in by about 200,000 units. We exited the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory on a look-forward basis.",1
"We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory on a look-forward basis. The iTunes Store generated record results with revenue in the quarter of $1.7 billion. During the quarter, we launched iTunes music stores in Brazil as well as 27 other countries in Latin America and Europe, now offering a catalog of over 20 million songs from major recording labels, as well as thousands of independent artists. And iTunes customers were amazingly busy on December 25, generating over 140 million downloads of apps and content that day.",1
"I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to sell a record 37 million iPhones compared to 16.2 million in the previous December quarter. This represents 128% year-over-year growth compared to 40% growth for the smartphone market overall in the December quarter, based on the latest published estimate from IDC. We experienced very strong iPhone sales growth in all of our segments, thanks primarily to the tremendous popularity of iPhone 4S.",1
"Customers have been captivated by Siri, which let's them use their voices to send messages, place phone calls, schedule appointments and more. Siri understands what users say, knows what they mean and helps them with everyday tasks and information requests. iPhone channel inventory increased sequentially by about 200k, leaving us with a little under 6 million iPhones in the channel at the end of the quarter, and below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks on a look-forward basis.",1
"Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $24.4 billion during the quarter compared to $10.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 133%. Nearly all of the top companies in the Fortune 500 now approve and support iPhone on their networks. This includes companies in markets such as financial services, consumer products, transportation, healthcare and insurance.",1
"iPhone is changing the way companies across the globe use mobile devices for work. In addition to accessing e-mail, calendar and contacts, many of these companies are developing and deploying mission-critical iPhone apps to help improve productivity and give employees secure and immediate access to information anywhere. Many companies around the world have thousands of employees using iPhone and business apps. Some new examples include Royal Dutch Shell, Credit Suisse, Kimberly-Clark, St. Jude Medical, Providian, Teradata, Nike, [indiscernible] and Facebook. We were very pleased to begin shipping iPhone 4S in China and 21 additional countries earlier this month. iPhone 4S is now available in over 90 countries, making this our fastest iPhone rollout ever.",1
"Turning to iPad. We were very pleased with record sales of 15.4 million iPads during the December quarter compared to 7.3 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 111%. iPad was extremely popular with holiday season buyers, and we remain very excited about the potential for this market.",1
"We expect OI&E to be about $125 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $8.50.",1
"In closing, we are extremely pleased with customer response to our products and the record-breaking results in the December quarter. We launched iPhone 4S to rave reviews, delivered iOS and iCloud to millions of customers and surpassed all previous records for quarterly iPhone, iPad and Mac sales. We are very proud to be delivering the strongest product lineup in Apple's history and we are extremely enthusiastic about our new product pipeline.",1
"Thank you, Peter. [Operator Instructions]",1
"Tony, it's Peter. We have always discussed, internally as a management team and with our board, our cash. We recognize that the cash is growing for all the right reasons and I would characterize our discussions today as active about what makes the most sense to do with the cash balance, but we don't have anything to announce specifically today.",1
"Okay. Great. I have a question on the iPad. Obviously, a very strong shipment number for the December quarter. But with that said, did you see any impact at all from some of the new lower-priced tablets in the market? And I guess looking forward into 2012, how do you think about competition from the lower-priced content, subsidized tablets like that of Amazon's models in 2012?",1
"We're really happy with the 15.4 million iPads that we were able to sell. And as Peter said, we did take down the channel inventory slightly. There's the -- underlying sell through was slightly higher than that. This is consistent with our long-term beliefs that we've had since -- before we introduced the product, that this is a huge opportunity for Apple over time. And as I've said before, I truly believe, and many others in the company believe, that there will come a day that the tablet market and units is larger than the PC market. In fact, it's interesting to note that in the U.S., it's clear from the IDC's recent data on desktop PCs in the U.S., that tablets exceeded desktop PC sales last quarter in the U.S. And so I think you can already see different indicators that there is significant momentum in this space. In terms of our competitiveness, the ecosystem for iPad is in a class by itself. We strongly believed in optimizing applications from day one to take advantage of the larger canvas, and we now have apps totaling over 170,000 available for customers. And that compares to what appears to us to be only a few hundred for the competition. And so I think people really want to do multiple things with their tablets. And therefore, we don't really see these limited function tablets and e-readers being in the same category. There is clearly customers that will buy those. I think they'll sell a fair number of units. But I don't think that people that want an iPad will settle for a limited function.",1
"And in terms of other tablets, last year was supposed to be the year of the tablet. I think most people would agree, it was the year of the iPad for the second year in a row. And so we're just going to continue to innovate like crazy in this area. And we think we can continue to compete with anyone that is currently shipping tablets or that might enter in the future.",1
"Okay. Great. And then, I guess digging into the iPhone number a bit more, you gave us a lot of great color on that performance, but could you dig in a bit more to what your learning in terms of iPhone elasticity with the new price points for the 3GS, I guess in both the post and prepaid markets? And I know in the past, you've talked about the iPhone and the prepaid market that sort of an evolving strategy that you all were approaching with sort of an open mind. How are you thinking about that now that you've had a full quarter with these lower price points and obviously, some success there?",1
"Each of the models, the 3GS, the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4S, were important in achieving the 37 million total units. And so we're glad to cover the broad range with great products. But the iPhone 4S was clearly the most popular among those. In the postpaid markets, as you know, there's a much smaller difference between what the customer pays in each of these. It's larger in the prepaid markets, and so it's too early to tell given we just started this October as to how this will play out over time. But we're thrilled with the total result, and you can bet that we're into details in every single country in the world trying to learn what we can learn to adjust and even do better in the future.",1
"Peter, Tim, I'd like to follow up on your comment that you're actively discussing, uses of cash. Is that any different, quite frankly, than what you've been doing historically? Or is that statement meant to suggest that you're thinking more constructively about cash than you have historically?",1
Is there a timeframe or will you actually tell us that you've finished those discussions? Or is there a process for which there is an ending and you will inform us about that?,1
[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Ben Reitzes of Barclays.,1
"When we have something to announce, Tony, we will announce it. But I want to say again that we are actively discussing the best uses of our cash balance.",1
"And then on my follow-up, I was wondering, I want to revisit the gross margin question. I think in each of the last 10 years, your gross margin has actually gone up from Q1 to Q2. I think the last 3 years, which is more representative of your mix, it's kind of been going up by 200 basis points. So by saying it's going to go down 270 basis points, that's kind of bucking normal seasonality by 400 to 500 basis points, sounds like the onetime items is about 50 basis points. Is the loss of leverage that significant? Or what am I missing?",1
"The factors that are -- Tony, that are going to affect our sequential decline are primarily 3. They are the loss of leverage from the revenue, so we reported $46.3 billion this quarter, which included a 14th week. We see our revenues being $32.5 billion next quarter. So against our fixed cost that will have a significant impact. We did have some onetime items in the December quarter which won't recur, and the dollar is much stronger. So those are the principal 3 reasons. I would also say that 44.7 is a high, high, higher than we have seen since I've been with Apple in 15 years. And it's hard to compare this year versus last because we're in different commodity cycles and different currency levels and where we are with our product cycles as well. Last year, we did have a sequential increase in iPhones, and that was a big contributor to our going up sequentially. We don't see that reoccurring this year, especially from the high of $44.7 billion.",1
"So we just got back from CES and everyone has a connected TV, trying to solve problems that only Apple can solve, and yet when we look at your Apple TV offering, it seems a little dated compared to what's on the market. So just from a high level, how should we be thinking about your strategy in the living room?",1
"Gene, it's Tim. The Apple TV product is doing actually very well. In last fiscal year that ended in September, we sold a bit above 2.8 million units. And just in the past quarter, the December quarter, we set a new quarterly record for Apple TV at over 1.4 million. But in the scheme of things, if you dollarize this in revenue that -- we still classify this as a hobby. However, we continue to add things to it and if you're using the latest one, I don't know about you, but I couldn't live without it. And so I think it's a fantastic product. And we continue to pull the string to see where it takes us. But other than that, I don't have any comments.",1
"Okay. And then Tim, you've been CEO for 4 months now, and I wonder what your early read on your new job has been. Has anything surprised you? Have you ever come across anything that you didn't expect?",1
Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.,1
"Yes. They, along with the leverage, the 2 of those together represented about 1/4 of the upside that you saw to our guidance. About half of it came from better commodity and other product costs, and the remaining quarter came from better mix, largely the iPhone sales.",1
"Since you touched on it, Peter, can you talk about how big the nonrecurring items were as a gross margin benefit in December?",1
"Rich, it's Peter. I'd like to just talk a little bit about the gross margin guidance to put the component environment in context. We do see that helping us sequentially in the March quarter. But overall, we would anticipate our gross margin to be down by about 270 basis points. And we see that largely coming from the loss of leverage on the sequentially lower revenue on the December to March quarter. The nonrecurrence of onetime items, which benefited us in the December quarter, and the stronger U.S. dollar that we've seen.",1
"Yes. Last quarter -- not confirming the percentages that you gave out, but we did receive better costs than we had rolled in our guidance on -- particularly on displays and NAND Flash and DRAM. And we would expect that NAND, DRAM and most LCDs would continue to be in a position that supply exceeds demand for the industry, and therefore those price trends should continue to be favorable in this quarter and we reflected that in our guidance. The big exception is the hard drive, which I pointed out earlier, which is constrained on an industry-wide basis, and where I believe we can navigate the supply issue that we are paying more for them and that's rolled in our guidance.",1
"Okay. And then for the December quarter, you obviously -- you saw some pretty dramatic declines in key components like NAND, down about 10% and DRAM down almost 40%. Can you talk about, within that context, how favorable you expect pricing to be for some of those key commodities here on the March quarter and whether the overall industry shortage of HDDs is having a material impact on pricing and other categories?",1
"Yes, for the December quarter, Rich, there was not a material supply or cost impact to any of our product lines as a result of the -- for the March quarter, we're not expecting any material supply impact. However, in the hard drive area, prices have increased and we have included those cost increases in our guidance that Peter provided earlier.",1
I was actually going to ask about the hard drive situation. I'd love to just get a little bit more detail there in terms of whether it did have any sort of meaningful impact on Mac sales during the December quarter? Tim and -- you mentioned that you expect to pay more for drives. I guess you don't expect it to have any sort of impact on revenue for the March quarter?,1
"From Citi, we'll go to Richard Gardner.",1
"In terms of the component environment, generally speaking, the component environment is favorable. That was one of the things that allowed us to overachieve on gross margin. And we would predict that, that component environment stays favorable on most key commodities with the exception of hard drives which, as you know, was very much affected by the tragic situation in Thailand. And I don't predict Apple having a material supply issue during the quarter, but we will pay more for drives during the quarter. And that's reflected in our guidance that Peter gave earlier.",1
"I don't want to comment on current sales trends other than -- because we have included, obviously, that in our guidance. But I would -- given that we just launched in China, I would say the demand there has been staggering. We are selling through our reseller stores and our online store. We're not currently selling through a retail store. And the demand is off the charts. And so we're very happy with the demand response there. The other countries that we launched in earlier this quarter were smaller countries in a demand sense. And so we'll see how the quarter goes from a supply-demand point of view. We did make progress as we moved from the end of the quarter until now, as I alluded to earlier, and got caught up in some countries, but there is still some that we are not caught up. So we'll see how we'll do going forward.",1
"Just a follow-up on the iPhone discussion. Tim, can you talk about whether the pent-up demand at the end of December and today -- is both countries like U.S. and Japan that had the phone all quarter? Or is it just countries that recently received and are able to sell the phone? So if can you talk about that, and then the second part would be, does the component environment and your production capacity or your suppliers' capacity allow you to start to address that catch-up demand, address China, which is new this quarter, and also help you start to rebuild inventory in March? Or are there any constraints that you see in the near term?",1
"Next, we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.",1
"The iPhone 4S was the most popular iPhone during the quarter. And consistent with most launches, we typically see a higher mix of the front end of the launch.",1
"My follow-up is, as we're doing the math here, it seems like the ASP is up sequentially for the iPhone. So it seems like there was a very good mix of the 4S and the higher capacity 4S, could you just comment a little bit on that versus the iPhone 4 which you cut the price of?",1
"Sure, Ben. This is Tim. We were thrilled with the 37 million iPhones that we sold. It's up 128% against a market rate of growth of about 40%, according to IDC's latest projection. And this is substantially above the 20 million unit previous record. We would attribute it to a -- just a breathtaking customer reception of the iPhone 4S with iOS 5, and key features such as Siri and this incredible camera with advanced optics. Customers are absolutely loving this product. We also attribute it to -- we made a very bold bet entering the quarter as to what the demand would be. And as it turns out, despite it being a very bold bet, we were short of supply throughout the quarter and did end with a significant backlog as Peter has said. That situation has improved some since the end of the quarter, but we still are short in some key geographies currently. I would also attribute the performance to the delayed purchases from the prior quarter as we discussed in the October call as the -- people were anticipating a new iPhone being announced. I think we made the correct decision to go with a broad range of iPhones. It turned out to be a benefit as we thought it would. And of course, the 14th week, as Peter said, is a part of this, although everyone knew that, as we did as well, and factored that into our guidance. Geographically, we saw strength in literally in every key region. But in particular, I would call out that U.S. and Japan, which got billing early in the quarter and had most sale -- many more sales days than most countries. I would also say that was particularly huge with the iPhone sales in Greater China, particularly considering that we did not launch the iPhone 4S in China until in January. And therefore, had no sales into mainland China during last quarter. And so we could not be happier. We felt we were betting bold, as I think many of you would have thought if you would have known what we were doing. But as it turns out, we didn't bet high enough. Our customers are loving iPhone and we're very happy with that.",1
"Tim and Peter, can you describe the iPhone momentum as you ended the quarter? And what is included for the iPhone in your guidance and your enthusiasm for the product as we head into the first half of the calendar year? Any more detail in metrics would be helpful.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer. And he'll be joined by Apple CEO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&A session with the analysts.",1

"Enterprise customers continue to embrace iPhone, with 88 of the Fortune 100 companies and almost 60% of the Financial Times Europe 100 companies now testing or deploying iPhones. Strong employee demand in custom app development are fueling deployment within the corporate sector.",1
"First question for Tim, how comfortable are you right now with the availability of iPhones and iPads? And if you still see shortages, how quickly do you think they can be addressed early this year?",1
[Operator Instructions] And your next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"I have a question for you with regard to availability of iPhones, especially with the Verizon launch. I think you mentioned that there was a backlog that you weren't able to meet in the December quarter. So I don't know if, Tim and Peter, if you could talk a little bit about what you're doing to ensure that you have sufficient quantities of iPhones and any changes you've made to ensure more component availability?",1
"Shannon, it's Tim. As I mentioned on the last quarter's call, we made a very bold bet, taking iPhone capacity for the September quarter with the new iPhone 4 in the lineup to 14 million. And as you may remember, we sold over 14 million in that quarter in total iPhones, so it was a fantastic quarter. And that was up from a previous number that with the 8-ish million range. We were able to step that up in this past quarter to over 16 million, as Peter said in his opening remarks. And so we were able to increase over 2 million. And weâre, obviously, have continued to work on increasing this further. But as with all good things, it takes some time to do that. Relative to Verizon, we are thrilled to offer the iPhone 4 to Verizon with 93 million customers, as well as any new customers who want an iPhone 4 on Verizon. And we're going to do everything possible to get the iPhones into as many hands of those customers as possible.",1
"And then I just had one follow up, with regard to the Mac App Store, which clearly just started, though I'm not sure how much you'll talk about it. But we've noticed your best-selling apps tend to be Apple software-based, Apple software apps. So how should we think about the Mac App Store? Any initial thoughts you have on it and initial things you've seen?",1
"It's just getting going, but we are thrilled to have reported over 1 million in a very short amount of time. And so we're very happy with the start of it.",1
"And next, we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.",1
"Katy, let me take each one of those separately. On iPad, we increased dramatically last quarter. We sold 7.3 million the previous quarter, we were in the low 4s as you know. That did get us into supply-demand balance and also allowed us to expand to 46 countries, or to a total of 46 by the end of the quarter, which added 20 during the quarter. And we're confident enough to add another 15 countries during the month of January that will take us over 60. And so we feel very, very good about the progress that we've made here. Relative to iPhone 4, I also feel very, very good about what we've been able to do. However, it's not enough. We do still have a significant backlog. We are working around-the-clock to build more. I feel great that the demand is so high, but at this point, I'm not going to predict when supply and demand will meet. We believe the reaction and results from the Verizon customers will be huge, and so I don't want to give a prediction right now when the supply and demand will cross.",1
"In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record-breaking results and customer response to our products. We look forward to expanding the reach of the iPhone in the United States with the addition of Verizon, and we remain very confident in our strategy and our new product pipeline. And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1
"And then Tim, one of the most impressive metrics is the sequential on your growth of Asia-Pacific. Can you just talk about what's driving that and what plans you have in place, going forward, to sustain that growth?",1
"Yes. That's a very good question. First of all, let me say that of the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India, China, we, several years ago, identified China as our top priority, and we put enormous energy into China. And the results of that has been absolutely staggering. To give you some numbers there and some specifics, we look at Greater China as a region. And Greater China, just for clarity, is mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The revenue from Greater China for Apple for last quarter was $2.6 billion, which was up 4x from the prior year quarter. And to further, just an exclamation point by that, we did a little over $3 billion for the entire year, fiscal year 2010. And so we're very, very proud of the team and the results that we've gotten there. Korea has also been a very, very good market for us. We had an outstanding Q1 there, primarily driven by iPhone and iPads. And there are several other Asian countries doing extremely well. Japan is not in the segment that you're looking out, but Japan by itself, the revenue was up 83% year-over-year. And if you're familiar with the Japanese economy and the growth there, to grow 83% on the base that we're doing is stunning. And so we are placing more and more resource in these areas and continue to look for expansion possibilities throughout Asia.",1
"Question for Tim in terms of the long-term business planning. There's been a lot of questions in terms of how far out you guys actually planned it. I was wondering if there's any insight you can give us in terms of what your long-term business plan is in terms of a product road map. Obviously, you can't share what that road map is. But how far will you guys go in Retail Stores and so forth? Is it a one-year plan, is it a five-year plan, is it -- any sort of insight would be helpful?",1
"Well, Gene, that's part of the magic of Apple. And I don't want to let anybody know our magic because I don't want anybody copying it. What I would tell you is that in my view, Apple is doing its best work ever, that we are all very happy with the product pipeline. And the team here has an unparalleled breadth and depth of talent and a culture of innovation that Steve has driven in the company, and excellence has become a habit. And so we feel very, very confident about the future of the company. I would also note to those people that haven't thought about it is we've done outstanding in our Mac business. We've had 19 quarters straight of growing faster than the market, but we still have a relatively low share of a very large PC market despite having great momentum there. And so it would seem like there's enormous opportunity still there. We have a relatively low share in the handset market. The handset market is well over 1 billion units a year, and the smartphone market is growing faster than a weed. And so there's enormous opportunity here, and we have incredible momentum in that space. iPad just got started, it's a new category. We sold almost 15 million through the first three quarters, and we believe the market is huge. IDC, I saw this morning, is predicting it to quadruple in two years. I don't know what to predict in terms of specific numbers. However, we believe it's a huge market, as we've said before. And so we're in some great markets, some fast-moving markets, we have the best products we've ever done and an incredible product pipeline. We feel very, very confident.",1
"And just a follow-up for Peter, in terms of iPhones, you mentioned that if not for production constraints, you could've sold more. Is there any way to help us kind of back into how many more?",1
"Gene, you can't run the experiment both ways, that's -- the demand for iPhone has just been incredible. We could not make enough in the quarter, and we would've loved to have ended with more channel inventory than we did.",1
"Thank you, Peter. Also joining us for Q&A are Apple COO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question please?",1
"As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $22 billion, compared to $13.5 billion in the March quarter last year. We expect gross margins to be about 38.5%, reflecting approximately $50 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.35 billion, including about $250 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $50 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. We are targeting EPS of about $4.90.",1
"I think that the consumerization that you speak of, of the enterprise, is one of the megatrends that are occurring. I think the most forward-looking CIOs are coming to the realization that the productivity of the person, the creativity of the employees is materially more important than everyone using the same thing. And the ability to write apps in a simple and straightforward manner for the iPhone or the iPad through the SDK is an incredible thing. And you can wind up, literally, running your whole business off of an iPad or an iPhone. And so I think the list of ideas and places that people can go there are -- were unimaginable just a few months ago. And so I see an enormous potential there. The numbers are already incredible. And think about this, the iPad started shipping in April, and we're already up to 80% of the largest companies deploying or piloting the product. This is unheard of, at least, in my dealings with the enterprise over the years. Generally, enterprise is much slower and much more cautious and uses things that have been in the market for a long time. And I think to everyone's credit, they've seen the value of this from a productivity and creativity point of view, and they're really moving fast. And so I think we're just scratching the surface right now. In terms of inhibitors, the iPad has a huge advantage because as you probably remember, as we went to various different iOS releases, we always put in a huge chunk of enterprise features. And so this isn't something that we just started focusing on. We started focusing on this before we shipped the first phone. And with the synergy that exists with the iOS between the different products, other products get the advantage of it, not just the product that it ships on initially. And so I think there's a huge play here for us.",1
"The App Store continues to be incredibly successful, with over 300,000 apps available and well over 9 billion downloads to date. We continue to be very pleased with iAd, which combines the narrative quality of TV ads with the interactivity of digital to provide a new kind of advertising experience. During the quarter, we expanded iAds beyond the U.S. to Europe and Japan and provided iAd Producer to marketers.",1
"We ended the quarter with about 3.5 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 250k. We continue to have a sizable backlog, and believe we could have sold even more iPhones if we had been able to supply them. And we're thrilled to begin working with Verizon next month to offer iPhone 4 to its more than 93 million customers, as well as to new customers who want iPhone 4 on Verizon.",1
"Turning to iPad. We continue to be thrilled with its momentum and customer interest. We sold 7.3 million iPads, a sequential increase of over 3 million, with distribution in 46 countries by the end of the December quarter. We continue to see great enthusiasm for iPads from consumer, business and education customers. Employee demand for iPad in the corporate environment remains strong, and the response to the product continues to be significant.",1
"Enterprise CIOs are adding iPad to their approved device list at an amazing rate. Today, over 80% of the Fortune 100 are already deploying or piloting iPad, up from 65% in the September quarter. Some recent examples include JPMorgan Chase, Cardinal Health, Wells Fargo, Archer Daniels Midland, Sears Holdings and DuPont.",1
"Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $4.61 billion. The sales value by iPads alone was over $4.4 billion, which yields an ASP of about $600. We increased the supply of iPads during the quarter and expanded both the number of countries and the number of channel partners carrying iPad.",1
"Channel inventory increased by about 525,000 units from the beginning to the end of the quarter to support increased sales and channel expansion, and we ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we reached over 160 million cumulative iOS device sales through the end of the December quarter.",1
"In November, we launched iOS 4.2, which brings over 100 new features to iPad users including multitasking, folders, unified inbox, Game Center, AirPlay and AirPrint.",1
"I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which had a record-breaking quarter. Retail revenue almost doubled year-over-year to $3.85 billion compared to $1.97 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 95%. iPad sales in our stores were very strong in the first holiday quarter. The stores also delivered a record Mac quarter, selling 851,000 Macs compared to 689,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 24%. And about half the Macs sold in our stores during the December quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. International Retail Store sales were particularly strong with our average international store volume exceeding our very productive average U.S. store volume.",1
"During the September and December quarters, we executed long-term supply agreements with three vendors through which we expect to spend a total of approximately $3.9 billion in inventory component prepayments and capital expenditures over a two-year period. We made approximately $650 million in payments under these agreements in the December quarter, and anticipate making $1.05 billion in payments in the March quarter.",1
"Additionally, our four stores in China were, on average, our highest traffic and our highest revenue stores in the world. We opened six stores during the December quarter, bringing us to a total of 323 stores worldwide at the quarter end, with 87 of them outside the United States.",1
"With an average of 321 stores opened during the December quarter, average revenue per store was $12 million compared to $7.1 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 69%.",1
"Retail segment margin exceeded $1 billion for the first time and more than doubled from $481 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted a record 75.7 million visitors in our stores during the quarter, compared to 50.9 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 49%.",1
"Total company gross margin was 38.5%, which was about 250 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this difference was due to better commodity cost than we had planned. The remainder of the difference was due to the leverage on the higher revenue and lower other product costs, including freight, warranty and phone support.",1
"Operating expenses were $2.47 billion and included $247 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $136 million, ahead of our guidance primarily due to the positive impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates from net asset. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, below our guidance of 25.5% due to the one-time benefit of the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit from January 1, 2010. We expect our tax rate for the remaining quarters of fiscal '11 to be about 25.5%.",1
"Turning to cash. Our cash, plus short-term and long-term marketable securities, totaled $59.7 billion at the end of the December quarter, compared to $51 billion at the end of the September quarter, an increase of $8.7 billion. Cash flow from operations was $9.8 billion, an increase of 69% year-over-year.",1
"From Citigroup, we'll hear from Richard Gardner.",1
"I was just hoping that you could talk about what components were better than you thought in terms of price during the quarter? And then Tim, if you could give us your thoughts on the commodity environment going into the March quarter, given that flat panels are below cash costs for some providers. What are you looking for going into the March quarter, please?",1
"Rich, in terms of the go-forward in March quarter and what is embedded in the guidance that Peter gave earlier is that we expect a favorable pricing environment for DRAM, where supply exceeds the demand still. Some prices for raw materials such as key metals is currently increasing due to the anticipated strengthening of the worldwide economy, and it remains to be seen whether that continues. The bulk of the other commodities from NAND Flash to batteries to HDDs to ODDs to LCDs and most other commodities are generally in a supply-demand balance. And so we would expect this group of commodities to fall in prices consistent with their historical trends. In terms of what we saw last quarter, frankly speaking, in most areas, we saw a favorability and it was a key part of us overachieving our guidance gross margin.",1
"Well, if you look at the iPhone portion, we had record sales on iPhone with 16.2 million units sold in the quarter. And Peter said we believe we could've sold more if we had more supply. From the market estimates that we've seen, it suggests that we grew faster than the market. Obviously, we're working around the clock on increasing supply. We're continuing to expand countries and carriers. And I've talked a little bit of that with Toni's question. We're getting enormous enterprise traction, with 88% of the Fortune 100, which is mind-blowing, I believe. 83% of the Fortune 500, 60% of the FT 100. So the enterprise traction is gaining. We have the highest customer sat [satisfaction] ratings in the industry versus Android or RIM or any -- we have the largest App Store with over 300,000 apps. We have now sold over 160 million iOS devices. And I mean, this is huge. And we fundamentally believe that our integrated approach delivers a far superior customer experience than the fragmented approach. And you can see this in a variety of ways from the fragmentation of the number of App Stores out there that people are going to pull their hair out, because they're going to have a variety of updating methodologies, and a variety of payment methods, and slightly different derivatives. You can see from surveys, people are doing to see who is on the latest OS, and you'll notice that the iOS is always off the charts on the percentage of people that have the latest version versus the other guys. We are launching with Verizon next month. We believe there's a huge pent-up demand there, and we think that, that will help us in the U.S. And so I think I'd probably just repeat it, much of what he said before. But the net-net is we think that our integrated approach is much better for the end user because it takes out all the complexity for the end user instead of making the end user a systems integrator themselves. I don't know about you, but I don't know very many people that want to be system integrators as a consumer or somebody in the enterprise. And so I think that the more iPhones that we can get out there into people's hands, the more people love them. And I think we've got a very bright future. I think the same thing about iPad. It's the same set of issues at the end of the day. The differences on iPad, of course, is that we have a -- we've been running three quarters without any significant competition of any type. And I think that the customer sat ratings on the iPad are also off the charts. So I don't know if any of that is new, I doubt that it is. But I think we're in a very good position.",1
"In the U.S., I'm just trying to understand how you see the tablet market more broadly having greater penetration rates, say in established markets versus emerging markets. But typically, the notion is that tablets in many cases are more about consumption versus creation. And just want to hear your thoughts, not on growth rate, but on absolute unit opportunities between the established markets and the emerging markets?",1
"I think that the tablet market is, the opportunity is so large, it's large everywhere, honestly. I think itâs huge.",1
"And we'll move on to Barclays Capital, Ben Reitzes.",1
"A question for Peter, I just wanted to cash out the revenue outlook. Your sequential decline of, I guess, 17% is a little more than last year's, but you have Verizon now for the iPhone. So what components, I guess, other than iPod, are expected to have to contribute to the big decline, if intuitively, maybe iPhone has some support from Verizon?",1
"Ben, I'll answer your question in a couple of ways. First of all, we're working hard to increase supply of iPhones. Tim has talked about that, but that will come over a period of time and not necessarily, overnight, as we said. In terms of the sequential guidance this year, let me start by saying we are thrilled to be giving you guidance for 63% revenue growth year-over-year, which will translate to a 50% earnings growth. So the business is performing extremely well. We're shipping the best products in Apple history and customer response has been tremendous. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we increased the iPhone and the iPad channel inventory by about 775,000 units, and this will have a bit of impact on the sequential compare that you referred to. In terms of the products, for Mac, we've just reported the highest Mac sales ever, and we've outgrown the market for 19 consecutive quarters. We would expect to see a sequential unit decline, which is typical for us after the holiday season. For iPod, we would also expect to see a large sequential decline, which is also typical for us after the holiday season. For iPhone, we'd expect to see a significant year-over-year increase. And for iPad, this will be our first experience, going from the December to March quarter, so we'll see. However, it was clear to us that the iPad was a hot holiday gift item, which fueled the 75% sequential growth that we saw in the December quarter. And given this, we would expect a sequential decline in the March quarter. So that's what's gone into our thinking, Ben.",1
"And then just a follow up for Tim, the last call, maybe, or one of the last calls, Steve had a lot of comments around Android and perhaps, some of its disadvantages versus your platform. Is there any other observations you'd like to make now that, we had a few more months, to see the market develop further and with Verizon, and even more tablet sales on the horizon, feedback you're getting from developers, or anything else you'd like to add on the battle with Android, kind of updating Steve's recent comments from last quarter?",1
"Peter, I want to see if you can give us a little more insight on the iPad gross margins going forward. Just given Tim's comments earlier about the bounty of underachievers out there, at least, nearly going, should we assume then that Apple can really improve the future set with the next generation and kind of hold pricing stable?",1
"And actually, Tim, if I could follow up, can you talk about which component areas you're making long-term commitments in on supply?",1
"I'm sorry, Mark, that's not a question I can answer. We don't talk about future products. But I can tell you that in terms of what we're shipping today, we're always aggressively working to lower our costs. And I think we have a good track record in doing so, and our gross margins were stronger than we thought for the December quarter. And I've provided guidance for the March quarter at 38.5%. And we feel very, very good about the performance of our products and our cost of products.",1
"And then my follow-up, Tim, I apologize if this question has been asked, I fell off for a moment, I want to come back to the MacBook Air. Just given the initial success here and momentum, can you give us any sort of insight in terms of how you're looking at that platform now? Is it kind of a premium tablet? Is this kind of more of a notebook still? I trying to get a sense of just kind of a one-two punch in terms of the iPad, with the MacBook Air, kind of giving you a kind of a double coverage, if you will, in both notebooks and tablets?",1
"The way that we look at it is it's the Mac of the future shipping today, and it was a phenomenal part of our growth on the Mac last quarter. It has gotten off to a unbelievable start. The customers love it. They love the precision of it, they love the thinness, the weight, the instant on and the list is long, I think. And so we're really happy with how it's doing out of the starting blocks. And as you know, we've only been shipping it for less than 90 days, and so we've just gotten going.",1
We'll go to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.,1
"Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC",1
"There's been a lot of talk about this consumerization of enterprise technology, and obviously, it's being driven by folks bringing their iPhones and iPads to work. I know you said it's some big share gains within your statistics. But I was curious if you think there still are some barriers around maybe developer training at the corporate level or security or things that just sort of naturally need to get worked through before you start to see those penetration numbers even increase further or start to see a wider swathe of employees use iPhones and iPads in business?",1
"I don't want to share -- do we collect it? Yes, of course, we do. The numbers for iPhone are -- there's many such numbers, they're now big because we've been shipping iPhones for a while. Any product that you ship for a while looks a little different at the prime end or in the early adopter cycle versus when you get to the mainstream. The iPad went through that cycle quickly, and moved to mainstream and enterprise and all the rest in record time. But nevertheless, that data needs to settle some, even before internally, we put a lot of weight in it. But the bulk of your question doesn't need specific numbers. To make a point, if you look at our Asia-Pacific business, the revenue growth was 175% or so. And so this is incredible. And the size of business in Asia that we've now built is massive. To do $2.6 billion in China in three months, where just two years ago, we did less than $1 billion in the whole year, it is phenomenal, or actually for the year before. And so I think we are -- it's clear that we're introducing a lot of people to Apple who previously had not been introduced to the company, and I think that helps across the product line.",1
"Tim, do you have data that you've gathered on the Phone and/or the iPad on new to the brand. You typically talk about Macs in the stores, you're getting 50% new to the brand. Do you have any data related to the newness of the brand? I would assume it's substantially higher to that, but I want to hear a little bit about that. And depending on that outcome, if you talk a little bit about how you think these products, in particular, the Pad in emerging markets may help to continue drive share opportunities for you?",1
"I think one of the -- part of the magic of Apple is that there's not high walls between these product groups. They like each other, talk to each other, they're of the same DNA, they want to build the best products in the world. And so if one has a great idea, there's not a ""not invented here"" in the other group. And so one of the key learnings from the iPad was that people love instant on, they really love that. And so the MacBook Air incorporated that, and that's just one simple example. But there are tons of examples throughout all of our products, where something started on one and went to a different one. And it's not always in the same direction either. It could start on the phone, and then flow forward, it could start on the iPad and flow, and so on and so forth. And so just the part of the way we run the company. And I think Steve said it great when he said, ""If the Mac company were a separate company, and the iPad company were a separate company, what would the Mac company build to compete with the iPad? And I think the answer is the MacBook Air."" And I think that's a phenomenal insight, and I think a great way to look at it. And it's not that the groups are competing, they are sharing and coming up with these incredible products that people really want.",1
"And that's a great way to look at it. One of the things that's interesting to me is I see this trend of your bringing a lot more of the functionality from the tablet side, you're bringing it on to the Mac side. It was talked about earlier, the Mac App Store that's now on Mac OS X. And then as we're getting kind of teaser shots of Lion, it looks like the next OS is also taking even more kind of design and UI elements from the iPad side. So maybe if you could just talk about that a little bit, are these two platforms really merging into one? And is this the future of computing as you see it? Or is it just -- are you just kind of grabbing one or two aspects of tablets and bringing it into the OS X?",1
"That's a good question. What we saw in the Mac this quarter was we grew 23% at the worldwide level, and that is compared to a market growth of only 3%. And so we grew almost 8x the market rate of growth, which is, I think, stunning. And every region outgrew the market, so it wasn't just one region. Asia-Pacific led the growth with a whopping 67% year-over-year increase, and that's almost 10x what market did there, to put it in context. Japan grew at 56%, which is about 6x the market, and Europe and the United States both grew in double-digits despite both markets contracting overall. And so we did significantly better than the market in every major region, and we're very proud of that. Now was there any cannibalization by iPad? Honestly, I don't know for sure. But yes, I think there is some cannibalization. But I also think there's a halo effect. As we've seen on the Mac by the iPod some years ago, I think there is a halo effect from Apple product to Apple product. And of course, we have introduced millions of people in Asia to Apple through the iPhone. And we're now introducing many more through the iPad, and I think some of those decide to buy a Mac. And so when you look at the Mac growth in Asia at 67%, and you look at the Japan growth at 56%, and you look at the U.S. and Europe growing in double-digits against shrinking markets, if this is cannibalization, it feels pretty good. The other point I would make is that if the iPad or tablets do cannibalize the PC market, keep in mind that we have low share of the PC market. And so the other guys lose a lot more, and we have a lot more to win because of that. And so honestly, cannibalization is not something that we are spending one minute on here. The iPad team are building the best iPad for the future, and the Mac teams are building the best Mac, and I can tell you that both groups believe that they can continue to grow and do great stuff, and I believe that.",1
"Can you maybe give us your updated thoughts on the Mac side and maybe specifically address the impact of iPads? With the tremendous iPad unit this quarter, the cannibalization question is going to come up. And I just want to get your latest thoughts on that, if we could?",1
We'll go to Brian Blair with Wedge Partners.,1
"Toni, I generally found people really want to do business with us, and their customers are very much desiring to have the iPhone. And so I don't really see a lack of desire. I don't want to comment about any specific country because I view any conversations that we have going confidential in nature. It is true, as you said, that we are not under a contractual exclusivity now in any country in the world. The last one was the United States. We have moved away from those. I can guarantee you that we always are looking at opportunities to grow. Of course, in the very short-term, I would also remind you that we're constrained on iPhone 4, and we're working around the clock to get as many of these out to our existing partners as we can.",1
"Tim, if I could follow-up on that, given your previous comments on China and the importance of that country strategically for you and the investments that you're making in stores, et cetera, can you may be use that as a case study for why you're only in one carrier there? I think you've said that there are no longer any exclusive conditions that you have in place globally with any carriers. So can you talk about other either impediments or hindrances beyond technology, of which CDMA is one, that may be limiting your ability to sign important carrier agreements in potentially very important and strategic areas for the company?",1
"Toni, it's Tim. Relative to the ASP, I generally would not do this. And I want to be specific, that this comment isn't related to the U.S. or any specific carrier or any specific region. But to specifically answer your question, I don't envision the overall iPhone ASP decreasing from the December quarter that we just completed to the March quarter that we're currently in. And as you know, as our long-standing practice has been, we don't comment on after, after that period of time. Relative to other carriers, yes, we're always looking and assessing in every country who we should be doing business with and exploring different deals and arrangements, et cetera. And so we'll continue to do that. What I've said before and we have seen this in every case, literally, that we've done, is where we've moved from a exclusive carrier arrangement to a dual- or multi-carrier arrangement, our growth has changed significantly and our market share has increased. And so that doesn't mean that would happen in every country nor does it mean that we're just out doing that in every country. We look at each one individual because each market has its own individual characteristics and parameters and technology. On the CDMA phone, specifically, I don't have any specific thing to announce today other than we're truly thrilled to be working with the Verizon team. They have built quite a company and earned a great deal of respect from the customers, and some of them have waited a long time to get iPhone. And we're very, very happy to give them iPhone, and any other customers that are non-Verizon customers who wish to buy an iPhone. We're also very happy that we've signed a multi-year non-inclusive deal with AT&T. And so we're very happy that we'll have shortly a dual-carrier setup in the United States.",1
"You've said on previous earnings calls that the move to iPhone non-exclusivity in regions of the world has had no impact on your ASPs. Can you comment on whether that is it still the case today and whether we should expect any impact in the migration away from U.S. exclusivity? And related to that, there are several large carriers globally that the iPhone is still not offered in. Can you talk about some of the reasons why that isn't the case? Many of them are CDMA-based. And given that you now have a CDMA-based offering, is it unreasonable to expect that we should see more CDMA carriers going forward?",1
"Well, and if you're look at what's shipping today, there's not much out there as you know. And generally speaking, there's two kinds of groups today, that are at least on the market today. The ones that are using a Windows-based operating system are generally fairly big and heavy and expensive. They have very weak battery life, they require a keyboard or a stylus as an input device. And from our point of view and what we've seen, customers, frankly, just are not interested in them. Then you have the Android tablet, and the variety that are out shipping today, the operating system wasn't really designed for a tablet. And Google has said this, and so this is not just an Apple view by any means. And so you wind up having a size of a tablet that is less than what we believe is reasonable or even one that would provide what we feel is a real tablet experience. And so basically, you wind up with kind of a scaled-up smartphone, which is a bizarre product in our view. Then you've got kind of a third group -- and so those are the two that are shipping today. And frankly speaking, it's hard for me to understand if somebody does a side-by-side with an iPad, I think some enormous percentage of people are going to select an iPad there. Those are not tablets that we have any concern on. The next-generation Android tablets, which are primarily what you mentioned in terms of the CES, there's nothing shipping yet, and so I don't know. Generally, they lack performance specs, they lack prices, they lack timing. And so today, they're vapor. We'll assess them as they come out. However, we're not sitting still. And we have a huge first-mover advantage. And we have an incredible user experience from iTunes to the App Store, and an enormous number of apps and a huge ecosystem. And so we're very, very confident with entering into a fight with anyone.",1
"On the iPad side again. Now that you've had the opportunity over the past few weeks to see more detail specs and in some cases, the price points for all the countless tablet devices coming into 2011. Can you comment on how you're currently dealing with competitive landscape for the iPad and how, if that's changed, if at all, over the past few months?",1
"And I would ask of that, that we have always aggressively worked to lower our costs. I think we have a good track record in this regard, and we shipped a lot of iPads in the December quarter, and have very strong gross margins. So I think we were quite happy with our progress.",1
"Bill, margins consist of a number different factors like which direction the commodity markets are going? Where the product is within the product life cycle, as well as the value engineering that we do and the negotiating and so forth we do. And so I don't think that you can take a single product kind of out by itself and speak about it with any accuracy. And as you know, we don't guide at the product level on margin. We're confident with the guidance that Peter provided on gross margin in his opening comments.",1
"Guys, in the past, your build materials for key devices has generally come down at a rate that allowed for fairly healthy gross margin expansion over time. And I'd say this has generally been true for iPod refreshes in the past, iPhone refreshes. Is there anything different about the iPad that we should consider going forward, that would make it difficult for margins to follow this historical pattern? And did you see some of this in the most recent quarter as well?",1
"It's something I don't want to give out, Rich, because I view it as a competitive -- something I just don't want our competition knowing. But let me talk about it in general and hopefully, that will suffice. From our point of view on the design side, we design components where we believe we can innovate beyond what's available in the market. And the most recent example of this is the A4 chip. But with the A4 chip, we didn't feel like we had to invest in the fab itself and build the fab because we felt like they were good options in the market for doing that, but not good options in terms of buying a design, and so we really focused on design. On the operational side of the house, as you probably remember, we've historically entered into certain agreements with different people to secure supply and other benefits. And the largest one in the recent past has been we signed a deal with several Flash suppliers back at the end of 2005 that totaled over $1 billion because we anticipated that Flash would become increasingly important across our entire product line and increasingly important to the industry. And so we wanted to secure supply for the company, and we think that, that was an absolutely fantastic use of Apple's cash. And we constantly look for more of these. And so in the past several quarters we've identified another area and come to some recent agreements that Peter talked about in his opening comments, in that these payments consist of both prepayments and capital for process equipment and tooling. And similar to the Flash agreements, they're focused in an area we feel is very strategic. And so I'd prefer not to go into more detail about what specific area it's in, but it's the same kind of thinking that led us to those deals that led us to the Flash deal.",1
"I love Apple, and it's just a reminder everyday of how much of a privilege it is to work with a team of people that are so incredible, and how lucky I am.",1
But from like a strategic standpoint or anything that you can add as far as your first 4 months?,1
"No, you can see the -- our results. And I think the team is doing a fantastic job. We feel very good about where we are.",1
"Could you review your comments about gross margin in the quarter and also looking ahead perhaps commenting on a few areas first of all where youâre on your product cost curve, where you expected to be and then also any comments on mix within the iPhone line in terms of 5 versus 4s, amount of storage and then also on the iPad. The last quarter you said you really didnât know what the proportion of minis would be, can you make any comments in terms of the demand for mini relative to what you expected?",1
"Number two, if you look at last year, as Peter went through in his opening comments we had 14 weeks in the quarter. We have 13 weeks in the quarter this year. Last year, in the average week, we sold 370,000 Macs. The third part of the bridge here would be that our channel inventory was down from the beginning of the quarter by over 100,000 units. And thatâs because obviously we didnât have the iMacs channel inventory was in significant constraint. So, if you just take these three factors, they bridge more than the difference of between this year sales and last year sales.",1
"Now, in addition to these three points, I would point out two other things, and these are lesser things than these other than the total of these other three obviously. One, the market for PCs is weak. IDCâs last estimate I believe was around negative 6%. Two, we sold 23 million iPads and we obviously could have sold more than this, because we could not build enough iPad minis to come into a demand balance. And so there was â we have always said there is some cannibalization there. I am sure there was some cannibalization of Macs there, but the three large factors of it, the aggregated totals of three large, the iMac, the difference in seven days of the previous year having seven extra days and the channel inventory, I think more than explains the difference between this year and the previous year. As a side note, if you looked at our portables alone, they were in line with IDCâs projections of market growth.",1
"Okay, thanks a lot Tim. And then just my follow-up is with regard to web services, online services, there has been a lot of publicity around maps and can you give us an update there? And then looking forward how does the year look in terms of innovation, in terms of iOS 7 and your online and web services, how will that drive Apple?",1
"Well, let me start with the second part of this. We are working on some incredible stuff. The pipeline is chock-full, I donât want to comment about a specific product, but we feel great about what we have got in store. In terms of Maps, we have made a number of improvements to Maps since the introduction of iOS 6 back in September and will roll out even more improvements across the rest of the year and we are going to keep working on this as I have said before until it lives up to our incredibly high standards. Users can already see many of these improvements because they include things like improved satellite and improved imaginary and improved categorization, improved local information for 1000s of businesses and so forth. The usage in maps is significantly higher than it was prior to iOS 6. In terms of other services we feel fantastic about how weâre doing, in notification center weâve sent over 4 trillion notifications and this is mind blowing. As Peter mentioned in his opening comment for iMessage weâve sent over 450 billion and are currently sending those 6 billion per day. Weâve gained center, we have got over 200 million registered users, weâve 800,000 apps on the App Store with over 40 billion downloads and so I feel really, really great about it, there is obviously more stuff we can do and you can bet weâre thinking about all of it.",1
And next weâll to Steve Milunovich with UBS.,1
Steve Milunovich â UBS,1
"Sure Steve, it's Peter Iâll start, Iâll make a comment on mini gross margin and maybe Tim can pick up on some of your iPhone questions. With the iPad mini it's hard to know, we could not make enough in the quarter. We were constrained every week. Customers love the mini and we wish that we could have made more and we ended the quarter with significant backlog. For the gross margin in the December quarter we were about 260 basis points ahead of our guidance, about half this difference was driven by lower product in transitory cost and we had reflected in our guidance and the rest came from a higher mix of iPhoneâs, a weaker dollar and leverage on the higher revenue.",1
"Yeah, thanks a lot. First question is with regard to Macs, could you talk a little bit more about what happened and it would seem that the shortfall there is well over $1 billion in the quarter or maybe even as much as a $1.5 billion and how much of that was pushed into the March quarter within that new March guidance? Thanks.",1
"As we look forward we think the gross margin will be somewhere between about 10 basis points and a 110 basis points lower sequentially. We believe that there are two primary factors that will benefit gross margins sequentially, first being the largest of the two. Our teams have made meaningful progress in reductions in product and transitory cost from the actions that they have been working on to get down to the cost curve. So we expect the benefit in the March quarter beyond what we saw in the December quarter and second we expect a more typical level of deferred revenue from device sales. We expect these factors to be more than offset by 10 to a 120 basis points by the loss of leverage coming out of the December quarter which is very typical for us and a different mix of our current products.",1
And regarding mix as an example as we indicated last quarter the iPad mini gross margin is significantly below the corporate average and we expect to be able to meet demand for this product in the March quarter which again we could not in the December quarter.,1
"Steve I will make some comments on mix, if you look, your question on iPhone mix I will bring up three points, one the ASP for iPhone was essentially the same year-over-year in the quarter that we just finished. Underneath that if you looked at the mix of iPhone 5 to total iPhone and in the previous year you look at 4s to total iPhone to the iPhone those mixes are similar and then thirdly I think you asked about capacities, in Q1 we saw similar results as we saw in Q1 at the previous year. So does that answer your question on mix?",1
"Yes it does. Thank you. And then second question would be on CapEx, you spent almost as much Intel does. I think you guys have said youâre not going to become vertically integrated per se but in a sense youâre since that as soon I buy an equipment for your partners, could you talk about the strategy here and how much of a differentiator this gives Apple in terms of your ability to ramp new products over time? And maybe a little bit more about how deep you will go in terms of semiconductor components for you, etcetera?",1
"Sure. Steve itâs Peter. We expect to spend about $10 billion in CapEx this fiscal year that will be up little under $2 billion year-over-year. We expect to spend a little bit under $1 billion in the retail stores. And the other $9 billion is spent in a variety of areas. We are buying equipment that we will own that we will put in partnersâ facilities. Our primary motivation there is for supply, but we get other benefits as well. We are also adding to our datacenter capabilities to support all the services that Tim spoke about in answering Benâs question and in facilities and in infrastructure. So, thatâs where the capital is going.",1
"From Cross Research Group, weâll hear from Shannon Cross.",1
"Yeah, Ben, itâs Tim. Thanks for asking that question. I wanted to talk about this, as if you look at the previous year, our Mac sales were about $5.2 million. This year, they were $4.1 million and so the difference is $1.1 million. And so let me try to bridge that. iMacs were down by 700,000 units year-over-year. As you remember, we announced the new iMacs late in October and when we announced those, we announced that they would ship, the first one, the 21.5-inch would ship in November and we did ship it at the end of November, we announced that the 27-inch would ship in December and we did ship that in mid-December. And so there were limited weeks of ramping on these products during the quarter, we left the quarter with significant constraints on the iMac. And we believe we know that our sales would have been materially higher if those constraints would not have exist. We tried to tell people this on the conference call in October, I think I said that we would have significant constraints on iMacs, but I recognized to some folks this maybe to surprise.",1
Thanks Tony. Could we have the next question please?,1
"Next, we'll go to Keith Bachman with the Bank of MontrÃ©al.",1
"So, Bill for iPhone, as we told you last year, we built about 2.6 million units of channel inventory in the March quarter, which allowed us at that time to get into our four to six-week inventory target. So, the underlying sell-through was about 32.5 million and we would expect sell-through growth year-over-year as it has for â in the quarter as it has for many quarters in a row.",1
Thanks Katy. Could we have the next question please?,1
"From Goldman Sachs, weâll hear from Bill Shope.",1
"Okay, great. Thank you. Katy had alluded to this, many of your smartphone competitors are now focusing on differentiating themselves with larger screen sizes than that of the iPhone 5 in your predecessor products. I mean, how do you think about the competitive dynamics for the market right now? In that respect, do you think thatâs a valid point of differentiation? And do you think there is a long-term case for a larger screen size or at least the larger variety of screen sizes for iPhones and for the smartphone category in general?",1
"Hi Bill, itâs Tim. The iPhone 5 offers as you know a new 4-inch Retina display, which is the most advanced display in the industry and no one comes close to matching the level of quality as the Retina display. It also provides a larger screen size for iPhone customers without sacrificing the one headed ease-of-use that our customers love. So, we put a lot of thinking into screen size and believe weâve picked the right one.",1
"I guess, and then shifting on to the question on iPhone demand, obviously you saw healthy growth in the key categories this quarter, but in the context of your guidance, can you give us some color about how you are viewing in-demand trends for the iPhone coming out of the December quarter and how that compares to what you consider to be normal seasonality at this point in the product cycle? And also did you see any meaningful deterioration in iPhone demand at the end of the December quarter or thus far in the March quarter that would lend credence to some near-term conservatism?",1
"Bill, let me take the second half of that and then I will hand it back to Peter for the first half. If you look at the iPhone sales across the quarter, we were very constrained for much of the quarter on iPhone 5. As we began to produce more and ship more sales went up with the production. iPhone 4 was actually in constraint for the entire quarter and sales remained strong, and so thatâs helped sales progress across the quarter. I will let Peter talk about the guidance.",1
"But Bill, let me make one additional point on this, I know there has been lots of rumors about order cuts and so forth and so let me just take a moment to make a comment on these, I donât want to comment on any particular rumor because I would spend my life doing that but I would suggest it's good to question the accuracy of any kind of rumor about build plans and also stress that even if a particular data point were factual it would be impossible to accurately interpret the data point as to what it meant for our overall business because the supply chain is very complex and we obviously have multiple sources for things, yields might vary, supply performance can vary. The beginning inventory positions can vary, I mean there is just an inordinate long list of things that would make any single data point not a great proxy for whatâs going on.",1
"Toni the most important thing to Apple is to make the best products in the world that enrich customerâs lives. Thatâs our high order bit; that means that we arenât interested revenue for revenue sake, we could put the Apple brand in lot of things and sell lot more stuff but thatâs not what weâre here for. We want to make only the best products and so what does that mean for market share? Weâve been able to do that and I think weâve had a great track record here on iPod doing different products at different price points and getting a reasonable share from doing that. And so one doesnât, I wouldnât view these things as mutually exclusive as some might, but the high order bit is making a great product, that enriches customerâs lives. And so thatâs what we are focused on.",1
Thanks Phil. Can we have the next question please?,1
I just wanted to make sure that I fully understand your comments about a guidance in the new guidance range that youâre providing. Are you effectively saying that when you provided guidance before it was uniquely conservative and that level of conservatism no longer exists? Weâre actually getting the real planning range for Apple and that this is fundamentally different from how you approached and provided guidance.,1
"Tony it's Peter. In the past weâve provided a single point estimate of guidance, it was conservative then we had reasonable confidence in achieving. This quarter and going forward weâre going to provide a range of guidance that we believe that weâre likely to report within, no guarantees, forecasting is difficult but we believe that we will report within that range.",1
"Iâm just comparing the word, so you think youâll report in the range before you - I think on average eclipsed your guidance by on EPS by 35%, was the guidance before something that you felt reasonably confident in achieving or was there an implicit buffer in there because Iâm trying to reconcile the fact that you said you thought it was reasonable before but your historical precedent was, you eclipsed it enormously on an ongoing basis and this time youâre saying there is a high likelihood of falling within the range and I want to understand the distinction.",1
"I will go through it again, in the past we gave you a single point estimate of guidance, it was conservative that we had reasonable confidence as you can have that we would achieve. Weâre now providing you a range of guidance that we expect to as best we can report within.",1
"Okay and then if I could follow-up Tim you started up the call talking about Appleâs philosophy of really ensuring that you satisfy your customers and making great products. Against that backdrop how important is market share preservation. This quarter you held share maybe increased it fractionally on a year-over-year basis in the global smartphone market but clearly you had an exciting new product. Is holding share in the smartphone market in 2013 a priority for Apple, yes or no and why? And realistically how does Apple hold share given that the market segment and price point that you play in is expected to grow a lot slower and you have pretty dominant share in that high end.",1
"Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what happened last year in terms of the refresh cycle where you had about 80% of your revenue refresh in the last few months? And then how you are thinking about it this year, I mean, I know you say you shipped products and they are ready, but I mean is this a situation where you are going to try to stagger it out a little bit this year or will it be sort of a similar situation to 2012?",1
"The question I want to answer Shannon, but the 80% was a unusually high percentage for us. I donât know exactly what the historic numbers on that, but I can tell you that the number of ramps were unprecedented in the fact that we had new products in every category is something we have not done before. We feel great to have delivered so many products for the holiday season though and our customers have certainly expressed joy over it.",1
"Okay. And then I guess can you talk a bit more about China, you provided which is where youâve broken out the Greater China revenue, but can you talk about what you are hearing from customers and from some of your partners there, your thoughts on retail distribution and expansion and just sort of overall, what you are seeing over, what you saw for the holiday period, and then what you sort of expect from China going forward?",1
And we will go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.,1
Scott Craig - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch,1
"Thanks. Good afternoon. Hey, Tim can you maybe discuss the tablet market a little bit in relation to Macs and other PCs is sort of how you are thinking about the cannibalization of that market for the iPad relative to the PC market? And then secondly, typically each quarter, you sort of talk about some of the component constraints and you certainly talked about iPhone 4 being constrained and the iPad mini is better, so as you enter into the quarter where do you see the challenges for meeting demand for the calendar first quarter? Thanks.",1
"Sure. Let me take the second part of that first. I think overall our team did just a fantastic job ramping a record number of new products during the quarter. We did have significant shortages due to robust demand on both iPad mini and both models of the iMac that persisted the entire quarter. And we are still short of both of those today as the matter of fact. Additionally, supply of iPhone 5 which short to demand until late in the quarter and iPhone 4 was short for the entire quarter, we believe that we can achieve a supply demand balance on iPad mini during this quarter and on iPhone 4 during this quarter. On iMac, we are confident that we are going to significantly increase the supply, but the demand here is very strong and we are not certain that we will achieve a supply demand balance during the quarter.",1
"In terms of cannibalization and how we think about this, I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity for us. One, our base philosophy is to never fear cannibalization. If we do, somebody else will just cannibalize it and so we never fear it. We know that iPhone has cannibalized some iPod business. It doesnât worry us, but itâs done that. We know that iPad will cannibalize some Macs that doesnât worry us. On iPad in particular, we have the mother of all opportunities here, because the Windows market is much, much larger than the Mac market is. And I think it is clear that it is clear that itâs already cannibalizing some and I think there is a tremendous amount more opportunity there. And as you know, I have said for two or three, actually three years now I believe that I believe the tablet market will be larger than the PC market at some point. And I still believe that. And you can see by the growth in tablets and the pressure on PCs that those lines are beginning to converge.",1
"And I think the other thing for us maybe not for others, but for us is if somebody will buys an iPad mini or an iPad and itâs their first Apple product, we had great experience through the years of knowing that when somebody buys their first Apple product that a percentage of these people windup buying another type of Apple product. And so if you remember what we had termed the halo effect for some time with the iPod, with the Mac, we are very confident that, that will happen and we are seeing some evidence of that on the iPad as well. And so I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity.",1
"Thank you, Scott. Can we have the next question please?",1
"Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Question Tim around the iPhone, Peter gave some transparency around the qualitative sequential and year-over-year potential increases in the iPad for the March quarter. How should we think about the iPhone family against that in terms of year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter potential increases or decreases, and are there any sort of dynamics around slower pace of LTE rollouts by the network carriers having an impact?",1
"Yeah. If you look at our total China, total Greater China, which would include our retail stores that are in China. Our revenues were $7.3 billion in the quarter. So, this is incredibly high, itâs up over 60% year-on-year. And again, thatâs comparing 13 to 14 weeks and so itâs really the underlying growth, itâs higher than that. We saw exceptional growth in iPhones into the triple digits. iPad, we shipped iPad very late in the quarter in December, and despite that, saw very nice growth. We are expanding in Apple retail there. In the year ago quarter, we had 6 stores we now have 11. We obviously have many more to open there. In our premium resellers, we went over 400, up from a little over 200 in the previous year. And we increased iPhone point of sales from 7,000 to over 17,000 there. And now this isnât nearly what we need and itâs not the final by any means, we are not even close to that, but we are making, I feel that we are making great progress that was just over there recently. And I was talking to a lot of different people and I am very happy with how things are going.",1
"The thing to consider on iPhone market is that in the year ago quarter, we have built 2.6 million units of channel inventory, because we did the â one reason was that we did the launch in the March quarter instead of in the previous quarter. And so the underlying sales growth from the year ago quarter was 32.5, the sell-in was 35 as you can probably see on a sheet in front of you. And so in thinking through, the number of iPhones to predict we looked at the 32.5 number We believe we'll grow year over year, but don't want to be more specific than that. We guide in the aggregate instead of the product level.",1
"And the pace of LTE rollout around the world, has slower rollout had impact on iPhone sales philosophy? Could that change?",1
"Today we have 24 carriers on LTE around the world for iPHone 5. Those are in countries like the US, Korea, UK, Germany, Canada, Japan and Australia and a few others. Next week, we are adding 36 more carriers for LTE support. And these carriers will be in countries that were currently not supporting LTE, so the LTE coverage now as of next week in Italy, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, Philippines, also several Middle Eastern countries. And so if you look at the total of all of these and the incremental subscribers that are in those countries, thatâs over 300 million. And so thatâs the next range of LTE rollouts that I am pleased to tell you about today. Also as you know, iPhone 5 also supports other ultra-fast networks HSPA+ and with downloads up to 42Mbps.",1
Thanks Mark. Can we have the next question please?,1
From Deutsche Bank weâll go to Chris Whitmore.,1
"Thanks. Just a follow-up on the iPhone question with respect to the guidance, just, assuming there is some benefit from the Mac carryover effect and iPad release etcetera, and adjusting for the inventory, it seems you are guiding to kind of mid to high single-digit year-on-year unit growth for the iPhone business from a sell-through standpoint. Is that the right ballpark we should be thinking about and why the big deceleration from the 25% plus kind of weekly sales rate you quoted in your intro comments?",1
Weâll go to Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.,1
Keith it's probably worth pointing out just to be totally clear for the last quarter we had strong sales of iPad and iPad mini.,1
"Keith Iâll add to that you know for total iPad sales weâre not going to, we donât provide a sublevel forecast but we would expect a large year-over-year increase in iPad sales but a post-holiday sequential decline for iPad sales which I think is typical and as Tim said we expect to be able to meet demand for the mini.",1
"Keith it's Tim and Iâm going to couple of comments, iPad mini was very constrained. We ended with underneath our target channel inventory rank which Peter has commented earlier. We believe that we can achieve supply demand balance on iPad mini later this quarter that was likely mean that we would need more units in the channel than we have today I think that would be a fair conclusion to draw.",1
"Well let me turn to my next question. Then Peter as we think about the March quarter Iâm a bit confused how to think about iPadâs and you mentioned that iPad mini was constrained, any kind of comments on what seasonality would be and more importantly how are thinking about the aggregate amount of inventory thatâs in the channel for iPadâs will that amount increase, decrease or stay the same as we reflect on how to model units in the March quarter.",1
I donât know who you were talking to and so again this is one of those things you I would caution on using as a proxy for the world. There are many carriers created differently.,1
Because we had heard feedback that there was a lot more of an upgrade cycle to existing customers but it sounds like thatâs not a statement that you would agree with.,1
"I donât have those specific numbers in front of me but the iPhone 5 obviously with the numbers that weâre selling, weâre selling to a lot of new customers.",1
"The first one is Tim could you talk a little bit about the data even as anecdotal on what, how iPhone sales proceeded in terms of new customers versus upgrades and how that compared to say if you go to the 4s last year.",1
From Bank of Montreal weâll go to Keith Bachman.,1
Thanks Gene. Can weâve the next question please?,1
"No Gene, the our prior method of providing guidance was a point estimate for each line item of the P&L including EPS and our guidance for the March quarter and how weâll give guidance in the future, weâre going to give a range for revenue, for gross margin and for OpEx and therefore there are many possibilities for EPS within the range that will leave you to think through and weâll report our actual results for March and April.",1
"Okay and just a house-keeping for Peter, Peter you gave gross margin guidance this quarter but no EPS guidance, is there anything, any moving parts between the gross margin and the operating line that we should be aware of that might have (inaudible) that nuance and how youâre giving guidance?",1
"Gene youâre asking me all questions I donât want to answer but let me see if I can find some comments to make that productive. In terms of the product that we sell today, the Apple TV we sold more last quarter than weâve ever sold before, eclipsing 2 million during the quarter. It was up almost 60% year-on-year and so there is actually very, very good growth in that product and what was the small niche at one time the people that loved it is a much larger number some of it, I have said in the past this is an area of intense interest for us and it remains that and I tend to believe that the, there is a lot we can contribute in this space and so we continue to pull the string and see where it leads us but I donât want to be more specific.",1
"Hey good afternoon. Tim, you made comments in the past that the Apple TV experience is dated and Apple wants to fix that problem, if we can take a step outside of the form factor debate whether itâs a box or can you just talk in high level how important this market is to Apple, number one? And number two is can you accomplish what you ultimately want to accomplish with the reality of where content is today, and how content is distributed?",1
Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray,1
"Itâs clear that China itâs already our second largest region as you can see from the data that we have given you and itâs clear, there is a lot of potential there.",1
"Sure. Kate, this is something that we continuously assess the opportunities to both invest in the business and return cash. We are pleased to have started our share repurchase program this quarter. And combined with our dividend, we returned about $4.5 billion of cash this quarter and we started the buyback program and expect to return about $45 billion over three years to our shareholders. We do consider increasing these programs and weâll do what we think is in the best interest of our shareholders.",1
"And then maybe a question for Peter, with such a large cash generation again this quarter and confidence in the product pipeline, you made those comments in a stock price that is off at highs, why not step up and buyback even more stock than you had originally planned at this point?",1
"Katy, itâs Tim. As Peter said, sequentially we increased over 70% from the September quarter, which was 3.5 times market. And so we could not be happier with that. In terms of the geographic distribution, we saw our highest growth in China and it was into the triple digits, which was higher than the market there. And so, I would characterize it as we are extremely pleased.",1
"Tim, Android versus iPhone. Is this, in your view, becoming a 2-horse race similar to Mac versus Windows? And how do you see the sustainability of your integrated model versus what happened in terms of the growth of the OEM model in the PC market?",1
"In terms of more carriers, we have been adding carriers. I anticipate we'll continue to add carriers. We have nothing specific to announce today, but you can bet that we're looking at the same list that you are. In terms of major carriers there, the number is much smaller than the number you quoted, as you know, there is a lot of smaller carriers on there. And the same thing with countries, there's many smaller countries. But all of those are important, I'd like to get into all of them over time.",1
"Tim, I want to come back to the tablet market here. Obviously, the iPhone was scintillating in terms of the growth, but I think the iPad growth also really outpaced a lot of our expectations. And the question really is -- it's kind of a loaded question. The question is really around -- do you think that Apple actually benefited from some of these lower cost, reduced features that tablets come into the market, where folks came in to check them out and realized not really that good, so they trade up to the iPad? And do you see that may be happening as well with the MacBook Air this year? Because this year seems like to be the ultrabook's version of ""Let's try to be like Apple as well.""",1
"Well, I looked at the data, particularly in the U.S. on a weekly basis, after Amazon launched the Kindle Fire. And I wouldn't, in my view, there wasn't an obvious effect on the numbers plus or minus. The theory that you've got, I have heard clearly from some customers that, that occurred, that they went in thinking that they would buy that, they'd look at it and decided to buy an iPad. Whether that's happening on a very, very large basis, I don't know. Again, my own view is looking at our data in the U.S., there was no obvious change in the data, for what it's worth. That's how I see it. There is cannibalization clearly of the Mac by the iPad, but we continue to believe there is much more cannibalization of Windows PCs by the iPad and there's many more of them to cannibalize. And so we love that trend. We think it's great for us. The thing that is very different about the iPad is you can see it beginning to appear virtually everywhere. The enterprise has adopted it in a very large percent of the Fortune 500, as Peter talked about earlier. That number is also quite large when you look at the Global 500. In education, in K-12, we sold twice the number of iPads as we did Macs. And generally speaking, education adopts new technologies fairly slowly, so that's somewhat surprising. And of course, the consumer is -- has moved in a huge way to iPad. And so it's winning market by market, by market. I think that consumers that go in and look at it and think about the ecosystem and the huge advantages and the overall customer experience, I think we will win a fair number of those. And I think you can see that in the results. And so we couldn't be happier with doing over 15 million. And I think it's remarkable that we sold over 55 million iPads, and we've only been in the business April of 2011, I think, when we shipped the first one -- or 2010, excuse me.",1
"And then the other question I have is given your customer data, are you seeing any sort of phenomena now where, because of the accelerated refresh cycles, the widened gap in terms of what Apple has given to the customer base versus the competition's meager efforts, if you will? Are you seeing accelerated refresh rates within your customer base in terms of someone who buys an iPhone, maybe they're buying it quicker or maybe they're also buying now a MacBook Air or an iPad, do you see an accelerated refresh rate or a halo effect?",1
"In the enterprise space, we've seen -- as an example, we've seen iPhones sort of being a catalyst. And the iPad moves after the iPhone. And in several accounts, we've seen the Mac follow that. And so there are clear examples where one product has pulled the other. And at a macro level, how much it's happening, it's very difficult to put our fingers on, but many customers, consumers, enterprise, education, they're all pointing that out. And as you know, we've seen that phenomenon before with the halo that the iPod created for the Mac back at the early 2002, 2003, 2004 range. And so it's not a phenomenon that is new to us.",1
"Next, we'll go to Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.",1
"I wouldn't classify it like Mac and Windows at all. The Mac has outgrown the market for over 20 quarters in a row, but still has a single-digit percentage of the worldwide market, where iOS, if you look at phones and tablets, and the iPod touch, we've sold over 315 million iOS devices. And so I think this compares very favorable to any comparison, and over 62 million of those were done in the last quarter alone. I don't have comparable numbers, Mike, on Android. I haven't found a way to get very crisp quarterly reporting like we do that is straightforward and transparent. However, you can see from a momentum point of view, if you look at the MPD data that just came out a few days ago, it shows in the U.S., and this is just looking at October, November and so this had part of our launch in October and then all of it in November, it shows that just the iPhones, looking at phones not total iOS, it shows iPhone at 43% and Android at 47%. The Nielsen data that just came out a few days ago shows iPhone in the October, November, December timeframe at 45% versus Android at 47%. And the comScore data that also came out on October, November shows iPhone at 42% versus Android at 41%. And so it seems like all of the data that I've seen in the U.S. would say that it's a very close race in iPhone.",1

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"I think on the iPad side, although I don't have specific numbers to share from third parties, I think that all of us inherently believe that iPad is way ahead there. And there's really no comparable products to the iPod touch out there. And so iOS is doing extremely well. I wouldn't say it's 2-horse race. There's a horse in Redmond that always suits up and always runs, and will keep running. And there's other players that we can never count out. And so what we focus on is innovating and making the world's best products. And we'll just keep on doing that and somewhat ignore how many horses there are. And we just want to stay ahead and be the lead one.",1
"Okay, just as a quick follow-up. There's 2 developments in the market on -- in smartphones that you sort of haven't approached yet, but Android has at least approached, which would be 4G and larger screens. In the past, you've articulated a fairly firm view both on the iPad and the iPhone of display dimensions, for example, you mentioned that earlier in this call in iPad. Has the popularity, for example, of larger screens on Android phones changed or impacted, for example, your view? And same thing on 4G obviously, some of these phones have challenges to battery life, but what are your thoughts there?",1
"Well, I wouldn't comment on the future roadmap, I'm sure that's a shock to you. But I would point out that we just sold a record 37 million iPhones. And so I think there's an incredible number of people -- and we could have sold more if we would have had more supply. But there's a lot of people out there that really love what we're doing.",1

"Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, maâam.",1
"On the second country on the list of those 4, for us, would be Brazil. I think there's a huge opportunity for us there, and we've more than begun to go deeper into Brazil. But I don't want to signal that, that means that Apple Retail would be there, because I don't envision that occurring in the near term. In India where it is small, the revenue went up over 3x last quarter, but that's on a small base. And so we're beginning to see traction in most of these, but we recognize we have to focus to deeply understand the point that we can really get to a large revenue figure like Greater China currently is.",1
"Yes, we are today selling in Brazil through online store and reseller partners, including some very key carrier partners. We're selling in Russia through carrier partners and reseller partners. And we're selling in India through some carrier partners and reseller partners. And so we're in all of those countries today. But I've tried to be very clear in the past, and I'll do so again, that we have a ton more energy in the China market today. That doesn't mean that there is a lack of effort or focus on the others. It just means that it's less than what we're investing in China today.",1
"Both of my questions kind of link to geographic expansion, maybe for Tim. I take the point of your focus in China, but it's also like -- I think if given what you said, you may be at 230 or 235 carriers now. There's about 500 carriers in the world, and I was wondering what your ambitions are and what you think the reality is over the next 12 to 18 months of I think at least a sizable share of them. And I had similar question on geographic expansion, Tim, just in terms of country rollout, you seem to have at least addressed part of China on the retail side, and it sounds like Brazil is next. But when can we look forward, Tim, you maybe addressing markets like India or Russia more aggressively with your retail presence?",1
"Shannon, we don't believe in lots of divisions like a lot of companies do. So we run the company as one instead of a lot of many companies. The semiconductor team works for Bob Mansfield, as does all of the hardware engineering for the whole company. And so Bob and his team are integrating Anobit into that team. Anobit has fantastic technical talent and we're really fortunate to have them join us.",1
"And can you talk a little bit about how they're integrated in? I'm just kind of curious as to -- since there's been several sort of semi-related acquisitions that you've made? I mean, do they sort of become encompassed within Apple or do you run them sort of as standalone divisions?",1
"Shannon, we have done acquisitions where it tended be smaller or medium-sized companies that have just great engineering and other talent, a great start on a product or a technology that we'd like to bring in to Apple, and sometimes including the IP. And that's really the acquisitions that we've done. We tend to do several a year. We're very, very disciplined in how we think about this and how we do it. And I think our track record here has been very strong.",1
"Tim, I had a question -- and actually, Peter, I realize you're not going to talk specifically about cash, but with regard to acquisitions, perhaps you can talk a little bit about your strategy behind some other acquisitions including your most recent one, which was Anobit.",1
"The first, the December quarter this year included a 14th week, which was the week between Christmas and New Year's. That week accounted for approximately 1/14 of the December quarter's revenue. Second, that week between Christmas and New Year's, fell within the March quarter last year and it will not be included this year. And sales in that week are typically greater than the average for the weekly sales in the March quarter. So when we think about our March quarter on a sequential basis, we would have loved to add that week in the quarter that we're now heading into. Last year, we increased the iPhone channel inventory by about 1.7 million units in the December quarter, so -- or this March quarter, so that benefited the quarter and reduced the comparable. The fourth, our December quarter results this fiscal year benefited from the launch of the iPhone 4S. We believe there were significant pent-up demand for the iPhone 4S heading into the December quarter, and it's been our fastest iPhone rollout ever. The previous iPhone launch took place at the end of June 2010. So in the year-ago December quarter marked the second full quarter of new iPhone availability. So we have some differences in launch timing. And finally, the U.S. dollar has strengthened in recent weeks, particularly against the euro, and we expect this to have an impact on our sequential compare. Last year, the dollar was relatively flat within the comparable time period. All that being said, we just reported an amazing quarter and we feel very good about the momentum of our business.",1
"Chris, this is Peter, I'll take that. Let me first start with units and then I'll talk about some points on revenue. iPhone, we would expect to have a significant year-over-year increase and be down sequentially, as we reported from the 14-week December quarter. For iPad, we would expect to have a significant year-over-year increase, and also be down sequentially as reported from the 14-week December quarter and the end of the gift-giving season. And for Mac and iPod, we would expect to be down sequentially consistent with our typical seasonality. From a revenue perspective, I completely understand the question that you're asking, and I want to talk to you about 5 reasons why I expect the -- us to be down in greater percent sequentially this year than we were last.",1
"Okay. And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about your revenue guidance for the March quarter. If you assume kind of weekly sales are adjust for the 14th week, it looks like you're guiding revenue down to about 25% quarter-on-quarter. However, you started the quarter with a pretty significant backlog of iPhones, et cetera, pretty strong momentum. Why would revenue be down more than normal seasonal or just historical seasonal end of March?",1
"We are now over 130,000 points of sale throughout the world. That's up about 35% on a year-over-year basis. And so we have consistently added points of distribution. That's both adding carriers that have captured distribution, our own distribution as well as key retailers, which are particularly important in some markets. We added carriers last quarter with KDDI in Japan and Sprint in the United States. And both of those carriers, they can speak for their own results, but we are extremely pleased with both companies, and while the incumbents that were in the market also did incredibly well. And in terms of China, China Unicom continues to be a very key partner. I've got nothing to announce today on an expansion there. But as I consistently said, China is an extremely important market for us, and we continue to look at how to grow it further.",1
"I wanted to ask about iPhone distribution in the quarter, and outlook for distribution as we move forward over the next several quarters. Can you give us an update in terms of where you are in distribution for the phone? And in terms of China, what are the prospects for expanding your reach from a carrier standpoint in China over the next couple of quarters?",1
That comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.,1
"I think Peter shared earlier the number of customers that had signed up for iCloud, and it's already over 85 million. So it's incredible that this has happened just in -- just a few months, period of time. We're thrilled with it, and the response customers has been incredible. It's solved a lot of problems that customers were having and made their lives incredible, much, much easier. And so I see it as a -- it was a fundamental shift recognizing that people had numerous devices and they wanted the bulk of their content in the cloud, and easily accessible from all the devices. And I think we're seeing the response from that, and with 85 million customers in just 3 months, it is a very, very important part. It's just not a product. It's a strategy for the next decade.",1
"Tim, then, try one for you. One thing you didn't mention much in your prepared remarks and subsequent questions was discussions around iCloud. And I just wanted to try to get some perspective: a, what's your perception on how it's adding value to Apple's products; and then b, as importantly, what are the metrics that you guys are using to determine if it indeed is driving success surrounding the various products?",1
"Keith, we're examining all uses of our cash balance, what we might do in the supply chain, what we can do from an acquisition perspective and otherwise. Since I don't have any perspective to share with you today, specifically on dividends or buybacks, other than again, we are actively discussing the cash balance. And in the meantime, we're not letting it burn a hole in our pockets.",1
"Peter, to start with you, when you talked about the cash balances, that you'll announce something when you announce it. But could you give us a little perspective on how at least you're framing the differences, opportunities in terms of dividends and buybacks?",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today are Appleâs CEO, Tim Cook and CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, and they will be joined by Treasurer, Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with the analysts.",1
"Thanks, Nancy and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. We are incredibly pleased to report an extraordinary quarter with $54.5 billion in revenue and new records for iPhone and the iPad sales. No technology company has ever reported these kinds of results.",1
"Thanks. Good afternoon. Itâs clear that iPhone 5 did incredibly well in the U.S. based on the carryover report to date, but international sell-through data points have been more mixed. How would you characterize trends outside the U.S. for iPhone and are you confident that you have all the right price points and screen sizes to fully capture the non-U.S. demand for iPhone specifically?",1
"We hosted a record 121 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to a 110 million in the year ago quarter. That translates to 23,000 visitors per store per week, a 7% increase year-over-year. Total company gross margin was 38.6% which was about 260 basis points higher than our guidance. About half of this difference were driven by lower products and transitory cost that we reflected in our guidance while the remainder resulted from a higher mix of iPhoneâs, a weaker U.S. dollar and leverage on the higher revenue.",1
"Outside the U.S., 10,000 iPads are being deployed as part of broad adoption of a local government workflow solution in Sweden and over 5,000 iPads have been purchased by the government in the Netherlands for the Dutch Tax Authority and the Dutch Court System. We began and ended the quarter with about 3.4 million iPads in channel inventory. That left us below our target range of four to six weeks of iPad channel inventory on a look-forward basis.",1
"Turning to Mac, we sold 4.1 million units in the quarter compared to 5.2 million in the year ago quarter. IDC estimates the global personal computer market contracted by 6% during the December quarter. We introduced the new 13-inch MacBook Pro Retina display as well as our stunning new iMacs in October. As we projected a quarter ago, we were significantly constrained with respect to the new iMacs and were only able to ship them for the final month of the December quarter. We believe our Mac sales would have been much higher absent those constraints. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory on a look-forward basis, which is below our target range of four to five weeks.",1
"Moving to iPod, we sold 12.7 million iPods compared to 15.4 million in the year ago quarter. iPod touch was a popular item in the holiday season and continues to account for over of half of all iPods sold during the December quarter. iPodâs share of U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the December quarter based on the latest data published by MPD and iPod continued to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.",1
"iTunes generated record results with revenue of $2.1 billion in the quarter. We established new all-time quarterly records for revenue from music, from movies, and from apps. We significantly expanded the footprint of our ecosystem during the quarter adding iTunes music stores in 56 countries, including Russia, Turkey, India and South Africa. That brings us to a total of 119 countries, where customers can choose from over 20 million songs to purchase and download.",1
"The App Store had a record-breaking December quarter with over 2 billion downloads in the month of December alone. The App Store now offers more than 775,000 apps to over 0.5 billion accountholders in 155 countries, including over 300,000 native iPad apps. Cumulative app downloads have now surpassed 40 billion and weâre delighted to have paid our app developers over 7 billion for sales of their incredible work. iPod continues to grow at amazing rate now with 250 million accounts and our customers love our iMessage service sending a staggering 2 billion plus iMessageâs per day.",1
"I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, revenue was in all-time high of over 6.4 billion with growth yield primarily by record iPhone and iPad sales. We opened in total 11 new stores during the quarter including four new stores in Greater China. We excited the quarter with 401 stores, a 150 of which are outside United States. We also relocated or expanded 14 stores that had outgrown their former space during the quarter. With an average of 396 stores opened, average revenue per store was 16.3 million or 1.25 million per store per week compared to 1.22 million per store per week in the year ago quarter. Retail segment income was 1.6 billion.",1
"Operating expenses were 3.9 billion included 460 million in stock based compensation expense. (Inaudible) was 462 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26%. Turning to cash, our cash plus short term and long term marketable securities totaled a 137.1 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to a 121 billion at the end of the September quarter, a sequential increase of almost 16 billion.",1
"Apple is in one of the most prolific periods of innovation of new products in its history. Just in the last few months, we have introduced new products in every category that we make. Each one of these reflects our dedication to making the very best products in the world. At Apple, we think about the smallest details and we are unwilling to cut corners in delivering the best customer experience in the world. This relentless commitment to innovation and excellence is the reason our customers choose to buy our product and this will always be the driving force behind Apple.",1
"The increase in cash was net of 2.5 billion in dividends paid and 2 billion in an upfront payment in conjunction with our accelerated share repurchase program. Over 94 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the December quarter. Cash flow from operations was a record 23.4 billion growing by almost 6 billion year-over-year of 33% increase. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $2.55 for common share payable on February 14th, 2013 the shareholders at record as of the close of business on February 11th, 2013.",1
As we move ahead into the March quarter I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. In addition to the reporting changes that Iâve already mentioned to further increase transparency into our business weâre changing our approach to how we provide guidance. In recent years our guidance reflected a conservative point estimate of results every quarter that we have reasonable confidence in achieving. Going forward we plan to provide a range of guidance that reflects our belief of what weâre likely to achieve.,1
Well we cannot forecast with complete accuracy we believe weâre likely to report within the range of guidance we provide. Therefore for the March quarter weâre providing revenue guidance of between 41 billion and 43 billion compared to 39.2 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5% reflecting approximately 90 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between 3.8 billion and 3.9 billion including about 480 million related to stock based compensation.,1
"We expect other income/(expense) to be about $350 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. In closing weâre thrilled to have generated over 54 billion of revenue in a 13 week period while executing multiple major product transitions. We sold over 75 million iOS devices during the quarter which is a staggering number. Weâre producing our best products ever and the execution by our engineering, operations and sales teams to deliver 10s of millions of such innovative, beautifully designed products in such a short time frame is phenomenal. Weâre very pleased with our record iPhone and iPad sales, our record music moving and app sales and continued expansion of our robust eco-system. And finally we remain very confident in our new product pipeline.",1
"Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?",1
(Operator Instructions) And your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"State and local governments in the United States are also rapidly adopting iPad. Court systems, county inspectors, and law enforcement agencies use iPad to streamline processes and replace huge amounts of paper. And state legislatures in Virginia, Texas, and West Virginia are all using iPads to give lawmakers instant access to government documents and information.",1
"In addition to the tremendous response from consumers, iPad continues to be the tablet of choice for businesses and government agencies transforming the way their employees work. Financial institutions like Barclays, Nomura Securities, and Bank of Beijing are deploying iPad to enable employees to better service customers and work securely with financial portfolios and products. In particular, Barclays roll out of over 8000 iPads has generated tremendous employee engagement and feedback making it the most successful IT deployment in Barclaysâ history.",1
"Turning to iPad, we were thrilled to sell 22.9 million iPads during the quarter compared to 15.4 million in the year ago quarter. That translates to over 1.7 million iPads per week in the current year quarter compared to 1.1 million per week in the year ago quarter, an average increase of 60% per week, ahead of IDCâs latest published estimate of 56% growth for the tablet market. Customers are loving the fourth generation iPad with its faster performance and spectacular Retina display. And the iPad mini has been a tremendous hit offering the full iPad experience in an incredible design that you can hold in one hand.",1
"We are also seeing continued iPhone growth in business across the board from companies replacing existing smartphone deployments to businesses adding first-time smartphone users. Companies around the world like Neiman Marcus, Skanska, and Volvo are issuing iPhones to their employees to improve interactions with customers and give workers access to essential corporate data.",1
"They also provide a secure and trusted eco-system that IT departments require. iPhone continues to be embraced by government agencies and businesses across the globe. Many U.S. government agencies are issuing iPhones by the 1000s as part of their new mobile strategies. Some examples include NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration.",1
"iPhone sales were driven by the tremendous popularity of iPhone 5 which weâre extremely proud to have launched in 100 countries by the end of December resulting in the fastest iPhone rollout ever. We ended the quarter with about 10.6 million iPhones in channel inventory a sequential increase of about 1.5 million iPhones and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look forward basis. While other mobile devices and operating systems faced increasing security risks and fragmented inconsistent user experiences, iPhone and iOS continued to deliver an exceptional experience that people love.",1
And on a sequential basis iPhone sales grew 78% over the September quarterâs results. Thatâs over 3.5 times IDCâs latest published projection for sequential growth of the overall market resulting in iPhone market share growth. We experienced strong iPhone growth in each of our geographic segments most notably Greater China where iPhone sales more than doubled year-over-year. In the U.S. Kantar Worldpanel Comtech estimates that iPhone shares of smartphones sales increased from 45% in the year ago quarter to over 51% in the current year quarter.,1
This represents a rate of almost 3.7 million iPhones per week in the current year quarter compared to 2.6 million per week in the year ago quarter. Thatâs an average increase of 39% per week consistent with IDCâs latest published forecast for the global smartphone market in the December quarter.,1
"As for the details of this quarter, I'd like to begin with iPhone. We were very pleased to sell 47.8 million iPhones compared to 37 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of over 10 million iPhones.",1
We believe this presentation provides a logical grouping of revenue sources and also provides greater transparency into our results.,1
"We have recast our operating income for each quarter in fiscal 2011 and 2012 to reflect this change and have provided a reconciliation on Apple.com/Investor. These changes have no impact in overall reported operating income. And third, we have realigned the presentation of product information in our summary data schedule to provide greater visibility to revenue by product category. Under this new format revenue from iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod sales is presented exclusive of related service and accessory revenue. All revenue from iTunes, stand-alone Apple and third party software and services is presented as a single line item and revenue from all Apple and third party accessory sales is presented as a single line item.",1
"Operating margin was 17.2 billion representing 31.6% of revenue. Net income was a record 13.1 billion just ahead of the amount generated in last yearâs 14 week quarter and translated to diluted earnings per share of $13.81. Beginning this fiscal year weâre reorganizing the presentation of our results to provide greater transparency. First, weâve established a new operating segment of Greater China given the very significant contribution of that region to our overall business. We define Greater China to include Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Second, for segment reporting purposes weâre allocating certain manufacturing cost and variances including cost related to product tooling and manufacturing process equipment to our operating segments instead of including these expenditures in corporate expenses as we have done in the past.",1
"Thanks Tim. Weâre very pleased to report the results of Appleâs first fiscal quarter. We established new all-time quarterly records for iPhone and iPad sales, significantly broadened our eco-system and generated Appleâs highest quarterly revenue and net income ever. Revenue for the quarter was 54.5 billion compared to 46.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 8.2 billion year-over-year. As a remainder our first quarter this fiscal year spanned 13 weeks whereas the first quarter last year included a 14th week. As such average weekly revenue was 4.2 billion in the current year quarter compared to 3.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 27%. The strong year-over-year growth was fuelled by record iPhone, iPad and iTune sales.",1
"Everyone at Apple has their eyes on the future, a future driven by the incredible hard work and dedication by the most talented and creative team on earth who all share a common purpose of continuing to create the worldâs best product and in doing so enrich the lives of our customers. Today weâre proud to share with you our latest results. Peter will review the highlights of our Q1 earnings and Iâll be back for the Q&A. Peter.",1
"You are going to hear a lot of impressive numbers during this call, but they are not the only way that we measure success at Apple. The most important thing to us is that our customers love our product, not just buy them, but love them. Everyone here is laser focused on creating an unprecedented customer experience. We have now sold well over 0.5 billion iOS devices, including a staggering 10 per second last quarter alone. We couldnât have achieved these milestones without the very best products in the world and unmatched execution by our engineering operations and sales teams to deliver so many innovative and beautifully designed products. Itâs simply phenomenal.",1
"Tomorrow marks the anniversary of a revolution. On January 24, 1984, Steve introduced the first Macintosh right here at a shareholder meeting in Cupertino. On the evening news that night, they said it was supposed to be one of the easiest computers to use, and thanks to the new mouse, you hardly have to touch the keyboard. We have come a long way since 1984, but we rely on the same spirit and drive that brought the original Mac and other revolutionary products like the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad into the world.",1
"Apple today is over 80,000 people strong and we are one team working together to surprise and delight our customers. Part of my job is to preserve our culture and drive it forward, so we remain the worldâs most innovative company. People join Apple to do the very best work of their life and there is no greater reward than seeing how customers love to use our products. We continue to believe that our fundamental, our remarkable people, our clear and focused strategy, our new product pipeline, our booming ecosystem, and more than 400 Apple retail stores will serve us well in the coming months and years ahead.",1
"Enterprise CIOs continue to add iPhone to their approved device list worldwide. Most recently, Fortune 500, like Wells Fargo, Archer Daniels Midland, DuPont, Staples, Starbucks and Genworth Financial, and Global 500 accounts such as Nissan Motor, BBVA [Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria], Standard Chartered Group and Danone, have made iPhone available to their employees.",1
"The sales value of iPhones alone was over $10.1 billion, which yields an ASP of about $625. At the end of the December quarter, we had iPhone distributions through 185 carriers in 90 countries. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year growth in all of our segments, with sales in the Asia-Pacific region and Japan both more than doubling year-over-year.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, and he will be joined by Apple's COO, Tim Cook, and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&A session with analysts.",1
"Thank you that's helpful. Can I switch to another topic? Can you comment on relative strength in the iPod business domestic versus internationally? I think relative to investor expectations, iPod numbers were better than expected in part given some of the data points that emerged during the quarter about US iPod sales. Can you comment on relative growth rates of the iPod business in the US versus international? And can you comment on linearity of growth in the iPod business over the course of the quarter?",1
That will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.,1
"Yes, thank you. I have a couple of questions please. Peter on the last call you had stated that iPhone channel inventory was 2 million units. Can you provide an update on that inventory level please?",1
"Tony, hi, it's Tim. Actually, I think I said last time that we did have a channel build in the previous quarter as you mentioned in the launch quarter of iPhone 3G. It was approximately 2 million units. In Q1, despite launching in 20 or so additional countries and some additional channels within countries that we had previously launched, we ended the quarter with sequentially lower channel inventories.",1
The level that we're at we're very comfortable with. And I think you have to obviously take the changes in channel inventories in both quarters into consideration in looking at sequentially the sell through.,1
"Can you help dimension? How significant was that change or can you help us think through in terms of weeks of inventory? If there was a modest draw down in channel inventory, it may or may not suggest that you're above your targeted range for other products of four to six weeks. Can you help dimension? Specifically, how big was the drawdown in channel inventory?",1
"Sure. I'll be specific. The draw down was about a quarter of a million. In terms of your question on weeks, that I can't be specific about because we were in 70 countries for the first time last quarter. This is the first time with that many countries that we're moving from a December quarter to a March quarter and so frankly we're uncertain as exactly the seasonal pattern of demand, as we move from quarter to quarter. But, based on the information we've gotten from our carrier partners, we feel very comfortable with our inventory level.",1
"Yeah. In terms of geography Toni, if you look at the US, the iPod sales contracted at the unit level about 3% year-over-year. So all of the growth that you -- that you see in our number -- that 22.7 was all international. If you look at the linearity at a worldwide level, it would look very similar for each of the weeks until you get to the last week of the quarter. We saw a rush of buying the last week of the quarter. Specifically, all of our growth occurred in the last week of the quarter. We attribute that to the macroeconomic environment and its effect on consumer buying behavior.",1
Thanks guys.,1
"Okay. And then, finally can you help us understand. If you think about your gross margins on a year-over-year basis, what kind of impact mix had on gross margins? Clearly we had some visibility from last quarter that the iPhone margins are substantially higher than the company average. That pushes up gross margins. Can you help us understand given that there were some difference in revenue growth rate across all three products this year, this quarter, and what the mix impact from each product was on the margins in a year-over-year basis?",1
"Toni, as I told you before, we don't talk a lot about year-over-year gross margin changes because there's a lot of moving parts. I think it's more straightforward for us to talk about it sequentially. As you look back this year versus last, we have a very different currency situation for example and a different commodity situation. And you know that gross margins were literally flat in percent terms year-over-year. That's all I can say.",1
And our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. The first one, Peter, how are you thinking about operating expense? I mean, you gave us the coming quarter's numbers, but just as it relates to revenue growth, is there anything you can talk about because you discussed on the call being a bit more conservative in how you're looking at operating expense? So any thoughts you can give us would be helpful.",1
"Sure. Shannon, we're very confident in our strategy, in our business. We're going to invest our way through this downturn just as we did the last one. We certainly saw the benefits of innovative products and quality points of sale as the economy improved the last time around. So we're continuing to invest in such areas as engineering, marketing, the customer experience to bring the industry's most innovative products to market and delight our customers.",1
"Okay. Given the discussions on currency, can you walk us a little bit through the impact of currency on your P&L? I mean, top-line we can understand, but in terms of sourcing and sort of how we should think about it from a COGS and SG&A standpoint.",1
Thanks Bill. Could we have the next question please?,1
"No comments to share today. Yeah, we're very excited about the next release, but we do not have a specific launch date to announce today.",1
"Gene, it's Tim. We are now in over 70 countries in the iPhone and you're correct. Some of those countries are non-subsidized markets. Examples of that are -- the largest example of that would be India in terms of the size of the market that we're currently in and they are like that and our sales are clearly materially less in those markets than they are in the subsidized markets that have post pay contracts.",1
"There was a tremendous pickup year-over-year. In fact Apple TV unit sales were up almost three times versus the year ago quarter. However, let me be clear. We still consider this a hobby. It is clear that the movie rental business has really helped Apple TV and there are more and more customers that want to try it.",1
"Okay. So when you talk about no pricing umbrella, you're referring more towards the subsidized markets versus non-subsidized.",1
"Yeah. That clearly, and you know us. We're not going to play in the low end voice song business. That's not who we are. It's not why we're here. We'll let somebody else do that. Our objective is not to be the unit share leader in the cell phone industry. It's to build the world's best phones.",1
"Okay. And second, obviously the strength again came from portables and Macs and if you're going to look at the overall industry growth, there's some evidence that that kind of a sub $500 netbooks are starting to gain share and grow little bit more quickly, which obviously impacts to your overall market share. How should we think about or how do you think about that kind of that sub $500 market?",1
"We're watching that space. But, right now from our point of view the products in there are principally based on hardware that's much less powerful than we think customers want. Software technology that is not good, cramped keyboards small displays... And so, we don't think that people are going to be pleased with those types of products. But we'll see.",1
"We are watching the space, as you know about 3% of the industry or the PC industry last year was in this netbook kind of category. And so, it's a category we watch. We've got some ideas here. But, right now we think the products there are inferior and will not provide an experience to customers that they're happy with.",1
"Okay, one last very quick question in terms of Apple TV. Is there any seasonality that you typically see a little bit of an uptick as any seasonality develops in that business?",1
"And we're going to continue to invest in it, because we fundamentally believe there is something there for us in the future.",1
"And, if I could switch gears and just get a product update from you as well. Any additional thoughts here on Snow Leopard? You've talked about it in the past. Any updates there on what you might have for a timeline? And if you're not prepared to give a timeline, any thoughts on progress in the development versus your expectations there?",1
From FTN Midwest we hear from Bill Fearnley.,1
"Yes. Thank you. If I could ask a question on the desktops in the Pro segment. In the Pro segment, how does that affect the Mac numbers and the desktop numbers? Any update on the Pro segment on the audio and video side and then I have a follow-up.",1
"The Mac Pro percentage of our desktop business is not large. Our desktop number is primarily iMac. But, to answer your question specifically that the Pro segment was down year-over-year as you might expect because small businesses are cutting back on expenditures in this current economic climate.",1
Any update? Switching to another end user market is important. And any update on the education market when there is a lot of chatter about what's happening with state budgets and you folks certainly didn't do a lot here in the last quarter in education. But do you start getting a sense of what you might be looking at for the calendar 2009? Any update to the education market here?,1
"Yes sure. If you look at our results last quarter, we were down 6% year-over-year in total and if you look at the K-12 component of that which is more sensitive to the state budgets, K-12 was down 10% year-over-year. There's very significant funding uncertainty in this environment and as you mentioned state budget shortfalls are almost everywhere.",1
"In fact, in the data that we're collecting 39 out of the 50 states have some form of shortfall. And so, K-12 was weak. In the previous quarter in Q4 it was weak again last quarter. We don't forecast individual markets but I don't see this picking up very quickly until there's a huge infrastructure outlay and hopefully now with a new President we may get some of that underway.",1
"Sure. We do have a hedging program. Our European hedges are recorded to revenue and our Asian and Canadian hedges tend to record to COGS. We do have local expenses, but they're not the biggest part of our business that can help in a changing currency environment. The operations team also has the opportunity to have conversations with suppliers as currency rate moves in. As we introduce new products, we will think about changes and local pricing. That's how we manage it.",1
"Okay. And then, my final question is just on cash. Could you just discuss any thoughts on the use of cash? Obviously $26 billion is a pretty healthy war chest.",1
"Well, not to make my answer any more difficult, but I am proud to tell you that we're over $28 billion at this point. And that's for all the right reasons; just very strong performance in the business. But there is no new update from what we shared with you last quarter.",1
"Okay. And then, the second question you mentioned earlier about the third-party discount theme you took at Best Buy and others. How have you seen those dynamics kind of play out in the last three weeks or so and how are you mitigating those risks?",1
"Great. Thanks a lot, Tim.",1
"Thank you, David. Could we have the next question please?",1
"From JPMorgan, we'll hear from Mark Moskowitz.",1
"Thank you, good afternoon. This question is probably more for Ron, but I'll ask it anyway. If you, Peter, and then Tim, as far as the retail stores, can you give us any sort of context around the same-store sales philosophy in international versus US in the past year and the kinds of follow-up on the multiplier effect if you will, when you open up these new stores internationally in the past year, are you seeing that pull through not only in the retail but also online and through some of your third-party folks in those regions where you're opening those stores?",1
"The retail performance outside the US was a bit stronger, and similar to what we saw in other parts of the business. And as Tim just alluded to in David's question, we think that our retail stores are helping us in each of our geographies. They are a great place for new customers, particularly those that are new to the Mac to come and experience our products, understand them and some people choose to buy in our stores and some people may buy elsewhere. We're fine with either.",1
"We just want to be sure that the Macs and the iPhones, in particular, have a great point of sale for new customers to come and experience them. And that's why we're opening the stores. As I said a few minutes ago, we plan to open about 25 in fiscal 2009, and about half of them will be international.",1
"Well, I'm not sure there's much to mitigate per se. I mean, the resellers are able to do what they want. Some here in the US, as an example, over the December quarter certainly did do some promotional activities, particularly with iPods, where they may have attached a gift card to it. If that's something they're doing and if they want to do it, it's fine. I've not observed much of that post the holiday as we saw prior to the holiday.",1
"And from UBS, we'll hear from Maynard Um.",1
"From Bank of Montreal, we have Keith Bachman.",1
"Hi, guys. I had two margin questions. You alluded to or mentioned that there was a supply chain adjustment to gross margins in the December quarter, and I think you said it was going to reoccur in the March quarter. Could you describe what it is and how much it was? And then, I have a follow-up question, please.",1
"Sure. Keith, we exceeded our gross margin guidance in the December quarter by about 420 basis points. In the range of a quarter of that were some favorable adjustments and settlements, primarily related to prior quarter items we had in the supply chain. I don't expect those to reoccur in the March quarter, and that's one of the three primary reasons why I see the gross margin declining sequentially from the December to the March quarter.",1
"Okay. Peter, my follow-up question, on the non-GAAP adjustments you provided a schedule this quarter as you did last quarter. The implied or stated gross margin increased substantially. It was about 61% this quarter versus 49% last quarter. What's the reason that gross margins increased so substantially in the non-GAAP adjustments?",1
"Sure. As we explained last quarter, the adjustment column reflects two things. The first is the reversal of the iPhone revenue and product costs recognized during the quarter.",1
"And then the addition of sales value and product costs to the iPhones and Apple TVs sold in the quarter. 61% is just simply the mathematical result of these adjustments, the in and the out to revenue and cost of goods sold. The sales value of the iPhones sold and added in during the quarter was $2.6 billion, and that was much larger than the recognized revenue of $1 billion that was backed out. So, it's really just that overweighting that you saw last quarter.",1
"On the iPhone, we have little history here to compare to and so it's difficult to say how we performed versus what it was supposed to be like. We saw a very strong ending of the quarter on iPhone, but in terms of during, I really can't make an educated comment on it given that it's just our second December in the business. Our first December in it, a large wide rolled out through many countries.",1
"So, the linearity itself strong in October after the portable announcements, weak before and I had mentioned that on the last call I believe that we felt that people were delaying purchases on rumors of the new portables and then for the balance of the quarter we saw again a spike at the end of the quarter which I think was not as strong as iPod but something that was created by the economic environment and the consumer behavior reaction to it.",1
"International versus the US, international on Mac was much stronger than the US. The US growth on the Macintosh was 2%. The international growth was 16% year-over-year and we saw several countries that were about 20 like Canada and Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, Italy several countries over 20.",1
"As you might guess, when we announced our portables, sell-through accelerated tremendously in October and the team here did an excellent job on the production ramp and therefore we were able to quickly serve those customers and so the October year-over-year data on the Mac is very good, and the portables all quarter as a matter of fact led to this which is a pretty stunning number a 34% year-over-year unit increase on portables for the whole quarter despite the tough environment.",1
"Yeah, sure. Macs sales were the second highest in our history as Peter alluded to earlier and only surpassed by just 3% from the previous quarter which had a materially better macroeconomic landscape than we did last quarter.",1
Thank you. And then you commented a little bit about the linearity on the iPod side; could you talk about linearity on Macs and iPhone in the December quarter?,1
"As you know, we also sell iPods in Wal-Mart and have a good relationship with them and have seen what they can do in that space and it was with that data and knowledge that we entered into this relationship with iPhone.",1
"Obviously, they have over 4,000 or so storefronts and they are in areas of the country that we have no Apple stores and so they provide a level of reach beyond of what we would provide ourselves or beyond what AT&T stores would provide. And so that's the reason we're there.",1
"David, it's Tim. We just started working with Wal-Mart on iPhone at the very end of December, and so we have not enough data to draw any conclusion about performance. From a reach point of view, what Wal-Mart does is reach a tremendous amount more people than we could reach in our stores.",1
"Okay, thank you very much. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pluses and minuses of adding Wal-Mart as a reseller of iPhone and what's different about Wal-Mart versus Best Buy or your own stores as far as mix and activation capability?",1
That will come from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.,1
Thanks Maynard. Could we have the next question please?,1
"Okay. Great, thank you.",1
"We don't forecast that at a product level. We obviously do internally, but we don't externally, in terms of our guidance. But the fear that we would have and I think that everyone has in this market, is that the economy may slow the adoption rate of smartphones, because generally smartphones generally command higher monthly fees and that may keep some customers to not signing up for higher contracts. But we will see. We feel very good about our competitive position as I said before and extremely good about our product pipeline.",1
"Okay. You spoke of some uncertainty about the potential iPhone seasonality, but I presume you have visibility because of the order lead times from operators. Given iPhone 3G is still kind of in its early days and you had some inventory drawdown, do you think you can buck the seasonal downtick that you typically see in the handset industry and see a sequential uptick in units?",1
"We're not going to give you an update on this quarter. We've provided our guidance for the March quarter. In this environment, I'm thrilled to be providing guidance that has growth year-over-year. And again, we're shipping the best products that we have ever shipped, and thankfully, customers are responding.",1
Hi. Thank you. Can you just speak to the linearity of your guidance? Obviously you have three weeks under your belt here. What in particular does the guidance assume in the remaining two months?,1
"And so, we're constantly evaluating the best way to play in these markets. We know that there's a huge market opportunity there, and we'll make adjustments in the future accordingly to play in a stronger way.",1
"Good afternoon and congratulations. If you talk about the pricing environment to the pricing umbrella on the iPhone, if you look at your addressable markets and almost billion subs that you currently address, about 60% of those markets are non-contractual markets. Are those markets that you're potentially interested in and how should we think about your addressable market, if they're a market that you're basically priced too high for?",1
"I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to have sold 16.2 million iPhones compared to 8.7 million in the previous December quarter. This represents 86% year-over-year growth compared to IDC's latest published estimate of 70% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the December quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $10.47 billion during the quarter, compared to $5.58 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 88%.",1
Total company gross margin was 34.7% which was above 420 basis points better than our guidance. About half of this difference was due to a more favorable component pricing environment than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter.,1
"We're proud of how rapidly iPhone has achieved such remarkably strong traction in the market. Based on its 2008 Business Wireless Smartphone Customer Satisfaction Study, J.D. Power and Associates ranks the iPhone in overall customer satisfaction among business wireless smartphone users, and according to AdMob's December 2008 Mobile Metrics Report, iPhone accounted for 32% of worldwide smartphone ad request in 48% of US smartphone ad request in the month of December, more than RIM, Windows, and Palm combined.",1
"It's clear that customers are now attracted to iPhone not only for its amazing functionality and revolutionary multi-touch user interface, but also for its unique ability to let users easily purchase, download, and use thousands of applications ranging from games to social networking to financial planning, and health management and our competitors are scrambling to try and copy our success.",1
The incredible success of the apps store is more evidence of what we have always said that software is the key ingredient for great mobile experience and we continue to believe that we are years ahead of the competition.,1
"I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores which hosted a record 46.7 million visitors during the December quarter or 14,400 visitors per store per week. Revenue of $1.74 billion also established a new record and grew 2% year-over-year. Our stores sold 515,000 Macs during the quarter, almost half of which were to customers who have never owned a Mac before.",1
"Average revenue per store was $7 million compared to $8.5 million in the prior year and the retail segment margin was $353 million compared to $405 million in the year ago quarter. This reflects the very difficult retail environment in the US where most of our stores are located. In addition, we have expanded Mac distribution with Best Buy over the past year and third-party channels discounted and bundled aggressively this holiday season particularly with iPods to drive profit to their stores. Given the retail conditions around us, our stores performed very well during the December quarter.",1
"We ended the quarter with 251 stores, and we now operate retail stores in 10 countries. During the quarter, we opened our first store in Germany in Munich, and it's off to a great start. Our stores achieved the highest ever service volumes as customers came in record numbers for help at our Genius Bars and personal training sessions.",1
"The remainder was split fairly between two areas: First, lower than expected transportation, warranty, support, and other costs, and second, favorable adjustments and settlements primarily related to prior quarter supply chain matters.",1
"Turning to the iPhone, we sold 4.4 million handsets in the December quarter which brings our cumulative counter 2008 iPhone sales to $13.7 million, well ahead of the 10 million unit goal for the year that we set when we introduced the iPhone. We continue to expand iPhone's geographic reach and we're selling in over 70 countries by the end of the quarter.",1
"Operating expenses were $1.4billion including $142 million in stock-based compensation expense. Total OpEx was below the low end of our guidance range as a result of lower spending in most areas of the company, particularly in sales, retail and marketing. OI&E was $158 million.",1
"The tax rate for the quarter was 29.7%; slightly below guidance, as a result of a onetime benefit from congressional approval of the R&D tax credit which was applied retroactively for January of 2008.",1
"Turning to our cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $28.1 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to $24.5 billion at the end of the September quarter, an increase of over $3.6 billion.",1
"During the December quarter, we changed our accounting practice for certain fixed income investments to more closely reflect the timing of when those marketable securities will mature. This change resulted in the reclassification of all investments maturing more than one year in the future from short-term marketable securities to long term marketable securities. We have reclassified prior balances to reflect this presentation as well.",1
Our investment priority for the cash continues to be preservation of capital which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short dated high quality investments and are comfortable with our investment portfolio. Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was over $3.9 billion.,1
"Looking ahead to the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We will continue our practice of providing guidance based on GAAP and will report our March quarter non-GAAP financial measures to you in April when we release our results.",1
"Recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales, and carrier payments was $1.25 billion compared to $241 million in the year ago quarter. The sales value of iPhones sold was over $2.6 billion.",1
"The iTunes Store had a record quarter had a record quarter; thanks to strong music and video sales and the continued tremendous success of the apps store. We experienced our biggest music quarter ever including our highest sales ever for both Christmas day and Christmas week. We are continuing to change the value proposition for mobile devices with the apps store and developer and customer excitement has been incredible. We now offer over 15,000 applications, an increase of over 10,000 since our last quarterly conference call with many more apps being added each day. We are also thrilled that customer downloads since the July 11 launch had surpassed 500 million.",1
"Okay, all right. Thank you, Tim.",1
We continue to believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide added transparency to our business and hope they are helpful to you in your analysis in understanding of our performance during the December quarter.,1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes and earnings per share. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2008 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We're extremely pleased to report record results for the December quarter that includes surpassing $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in Apple's history, setting a new record for iPod sales and generating all-time high quarterly earnings. We entered the holiday season with our best product lineup ever and our customers responded.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $10.17 billion, representing 6% growth over the prior December quarter's result and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin for the quarter was better than expected at 20.9% due to higher than anticipated gross margin and strong operating expense management. Net income was $1.6 billion, which translated to earnings per share of $1.78.",1
"As we discussed on last quarter's conference call, we supplement our analysis of the business internally by using non-GAAP financial measures that correspond to the total sales and product costs of iPhones and Apple TVs sold during the quarter. Our earnings press release provides a full description of these non-GAAP measures, including how we use them, how they are derived and their limitations.",1
"In terms of non-GAAP measures, adjusted sales totaled $11.8 billion for the December quarter, which was $1.6 billion higher than our reported revenue. Adjusted gross margin was $4.5 billion, which was $1 billion higher than our reported gross margin, and adjusted net income was $2.3 billion, which was $700 million higher than our reported net income.",1
"Now turning to the details of our results, I'd like to begin with Mac products and services. For the December quarter, we sold 2.5 million Macs, representing 9% growth over the prior December quarter's results. We are extremely proud of this very solid growth, particularly in contrast to the performance of the rest of the market.",1
"For the latest period reported, iPod's share of the MP3 market was over 70% in the UK and Australia, over 60% in Japan and over 50% in Canada. We were also pleased with continued year-over-year share gains in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory or a look-forward basis.",1
"In its latest update published last week, IDC estimated that the overall market for personal computers contracted during the December quarter. Customer response to the new MacBook and MacBook Pro introduced in October was very strong, driving year-over-year portables growth of 34% and an overall portable mix of 71%, the highest ever for Apple.",1
"Desktop unit sales declined by 25% year-over-year. It's important to remember that in the prior December quarter, desktop sales grew by a phenomenal 53% year-over-year, given the very successful launch of the new iMac in August 2007. In addition to this tough comparison, we believe the year-over-year decline in desktop sales is a reflection of the shift towards portables in the overall market in customer response to our October announcements. IDC's latest published estimate indicates a 16% contraction in global desktop shipments during the December quarter.",1
"We are very pleased with overall Mac share gains, and believe our outstanding new features in iLife '09 and iWork '09 introduced earlier this month will distance the Mac experience even farther from the competition. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.",1
"Now, I'd like to discuss our music products and services. We sold over 22.7 million iPods, a new quarterly record, representing 3% growth over the previous record sales in the year ago quarter. We were thrilled with customer response to the new iPods introduced in September.",1
"Customers love the sleek design and selection of the new Nano, while the superior features of the iPod touch, coupled with the amazing breadth and popularity of content on the App Store have helped establish the iPod Touch as an outstanding gaming, entertainment, communications and information platform.",1
"We remain very pleased with iPod market share. Our share of the US market for MP3 players was over 70% in the month of December, based on the latest data published by NPD. And we continue to gain share year-over-year in international markets based on the latest data published by GFK.",1
"We are shipping the best products in our history and we remain very confident in our business. Our visibility remains rather low in the current environment, making our forecasting challenging, and we are therefore going to provide a broad range of revenue and earnings guidance for the March quarter.",1
"We expect revenue to be between about $7.6 billion and $8 billion. We expect gross margin to be about 32.5%, reflecting approximately $28 million related to stock-based compensation expense compared to 34.7% gross margin in the December quarter. This sequential decline reflects the impact of the stronger US dollar. The favorable supply chain adjustments and settlements from the December quarter are not reoccurring, and the sequentially lower revenue as we have seen in past years.",1
"We expect OpEx to be about $1.33 billion, including about $150 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $60 million reflective of the short-term interest rate environment and we expect the tax rate to be about 31%. We are targeting EPS in the range of about $0.90 to $1.",1
"Is that the only factor that leads you to give a more narrow range for the March quarter? Or is there something else that's giving you confidence in the business going into March, which is traditionally a tougher quarter for consumer companies?",1
"Well, we reported our December quarter and I've given you our guidance for the March quarter. But as I look forward, I would see our gross margins being about 30% in the second half of the fiscal 2009. Our guidance in the March quarter of 32.5 is benefiting from a very favorable commodity environment and thanks to our hedging program, we've not seen the full impact of the US dollar strengthening, which began in August of last year.",1
"We continue to anticipate gross margins, as I said, about 30 in the second half. Considering the commodity environment and the stronger dollar, we are also continuing to focus on delivering state-of-the-art products at price points our competitors can't match. We want to provide increasing value to our customers and we are not going to leave any pricing umbrellas.",1
"Okay. Thanks, guys.",1
"Thank you, Bill. Can we have the next question please?",1
And the next question from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.,1
"Okay, thank you. Peter, I guess one for you and then one for Tim. First of all, you mentioned that you were giving a wider range than normal for guidance for the March quarter. However, the range is considerably narrower than the one that you provided for the December quarter. And I realize that you're building up a base of recurring revenue with the iPhone.",1
"Our models are not as precise as they have been. And our visibility really isn't as good as it had been in the past. And in prior quarters Rich, we had really given more of a single point estimate for the top line. As you know, and as you said in the December quarter, we gave $1 billion range for revenue.",1
"In closing, we are extremely proud of our performance and record results in the December quarter. We are fortunate to have the world's best customers and employees especially in these times. We are continuing to focus on developing the industry's most innovative products, and we are very excited about our new product pipeline.",1
"But it was a much bigger quarter with a much higher level of sales expected to occur, and actually did occur in the last weeks of the quarter. But I would consider a $400 million range pretty wide for us. Yes, we do have recurring parts of our business. And so we are shipping the best products that we ever have as a company. So that gives us some confidence as well.",1
"Rich, I would just add that if you think back to the timing of the guidance, we were in a period of time where banks were going down, what seemed like every other day and it does seem like where things, where the economy is clearly in bad shape that it is not as unpredictable as it was in October perhaps.",1
"Okay. And then as a follow-up for you Tim. You typically give us an update on the component pricing environment from quarter-to-quarter. We've seen some pretty dramatic increases at least in spot prices for things like DRAM, NAND, and flat panels here recently. And I'm wondering if you can remind us what you do to mitigate the impact of that on your cost of goods, given that you tend to adjust prices less frequently than some of your PC competition?",1
Maybe I should talk about what I think will occur in the quarter and what occurred last quarter. Last quarter was incredibly favorable. Peter said that it was a key factor in the reason our gross margin beat our guidance. We saw several commodities do much better than we thought like DRAM and NAND Flash and LCDs and we saw frankly some commodities selling at or near variable costs and we think further reductions from those levels are just not likely.,1
"We do, however, in the aggregate, expect a continued favorable environment, on both supply and price this quarter, for NAND, for DRAM, for LCD, and for drives, and for most other commodities. And so, I think when you look at it in the aggregate, it will still be positive, but the falls from where we were are not going to be like they were in the Q1 time frame.",1
Okay. And Rich I would caution you to remember that there's a difference between the spot markets and the contract markets.,1
"Okay. And then a quick question on the gross margin line. Given the gross margin upside and the guidance of the gross margins and the March quarter, I'm assuming it's not still reasonable to assume gross margins will average out at 30% for fiscal 2009, as it did a few quarters ago, is that true?",1
"We believe that the $199 level. And this includes signing up for contract obviously that this is a compelling value and we see nothing in the marketplace anywhere close to it. We still believe that we're years ahead of the competition from a software point of view. And when you throw in the Applications Store with the statistics that Peter pointed earlier with over 15,000 Apps and over half a billion downloads in a very, very short period of time, we feel very, very good about our competitive position.",1
"Bill, it's Tim. This segment is clearly elastic. And you can see that over the course of the time that we have been selling iPhone, you've seen the price. And I'll just talk to the US market for a moment to make this simple. It moved from $599 to $399. We saw a tremendous jump in the run rate. And then as we went from $399 to $199 and introduced the iPhone 3G, we saw another significant jump in the run rate. So there's clearly a price elasticity in this market.",1
"Okay, thanks. Peter, in the past you've noted that in Apple's experience at least the iPod segment is fairly price elastic, but the Mac segment is fairly inelastic. Now, that you've had several quarters of iPhone data, could you help us understand whether or not you characterize this segment as elastic or inelastic, and if it is elastic, do you think handset price reductions would eventually make sense in this environment to spur unit demand?",1
And that will come from Bill Shope with Credit Suisse.,1
"Thank you, Ben. Could we have next question please?",1
Thanks a lot. I'll cede the floor.,1
"Ben, we plan to open about 25 stores in fiscal 2009, about half of those will come internationally. And Ron and his team are continuing to be very selective with real estate and won't take a bad site. Our stores are amazingly productive and are providing outstanding service to our customers. I went through some of that in my prepared remarks. The environment around us was a bit tough, but the stores performed very, very well. We are very confident in our stores and the asset that we are building.",1
"And is there anything we should be concerned about long term if retail slows any impact on margin, maybe with regard to capacity utilization or utilization of your properties? Anything you're thinking about there in this type of slower environment?",1
"Thanks a lot, Tim. And I wanted to wish you all the best and Steve as well. The last question for me is just a little more on retail. Could you guys with the flat performance sequentially and what's going on in the environment, are you guys planning to scale down your expansion?",1
"And frankly, we don't settle for anything less than excellence in every group in the company, and we have the self-honesty to admit when we're wrong and the courage to change. And I think regardless of who is in what job those values are so embedded in this company that Apple will do extremely well. And I would just reiterate a point Peter made in his opening comments that I strongly believe that Apple is doing the best work in its history.",1
"We believe in saying no to thousands of projects, so that we can really focus on the few that are truly important and meaningful to us. We believe in deep collaboration and cross-pollination of our groups, which allow us to innovate in a way that others cannot.",1
"We are constantly focusing on innovating. We believe in the simple not the complex. We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make, and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution.",1
"Ben, let me add something to that and backup just a bit. There is extraordinary breadth and depth and tenure among the Apple executive team, and they lead 35,000 employees that I would call wicked smart - and that's in all areas of the company from engineering to marketing to operations and sales and all the rest. And the values of our company are extremely well entrenched. We believe that we are on the face of the earth to make great products and that's not changing.",1
"Ben, it's Peter. Steve is the CEO of Apple and plans to remain involved in major strategic decisions and Tim will be responsible for our day-to-day operations.",1
"Okay, thanks a lot and nice performance. Well, given that I'm going first, I'll ask how Steve is. I hope he's doing well and I just want to know how you'll run the company differently. With Tim or the same, and if need be, if Tim, do you feel like you would be the likely candidate if the worse case scenario were to happen; were Steve unable to return? Do you feel like you would be the candidate that would steer the helm here?",1
(Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from Ben Reitzes of Barclays Capital.,1
"However, on a sequential basis, the iPhone 3G gross margin was higher in the December quarter, and this was a result of lower product costs partially offset by a stronger dollar. But it was less than 61% in terms of its gross margin, just like it was less than the 48 last quarter.",1
"Thanks Keith. Could we have the next question, please?",1
We'll hear from Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.,1
"For competitive reasons, we donât want to share much of the answers to the question you asked. I am sorry. Again it is for competitive reasons. What I will share with you is we are way ahead of our competitors with over 100,000 apps on our store. That dwarfs anybody we are competing with. We provided many, many great applications with our developers to customers. That is helping us with both iPhone and iPod touch. It was one of the few reasons why iTunes set a record in the quarter.",1
"I want to revisit the discussion on China and emerging markets from a broader perspective because these regions tend to share characteristics that are very different than the mature markets where you have had lots of success, particularly the percentage of customers that purchase phone service on a prepaid basis, lower average income levels, etc. As you think about those barriers, is it appropriate to rollout iPhone and other products and pricing and distribution in a homogenous or global way or might you down the road have to look at it on a country by country or region by region basis?",1
"We have just really got going in China. I really like what I see so far. Although the average income is not nearly as high as perhaps the United States and some other western European markets, there is a significant size middle class and up there. I think to do a real deep analysis, you really have to look not just at the averages but at the distribution of income within these countries. We have been selling in Brazil for a while and are learning about Brazil as well. The Brazilian economy is different than the Chinese economy because the duties are very significant and the taxes are very significant there which tends to compound the price.",1
"But we are very focused on these markets. In fact, if you look at greater China last quarter, which is China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, our revenues tripled year-over-year in that geography which is I think phenomenal by any measure. We have a tremendous focus on it. As was alluded to earlier in the call, 58% of our revenue last quarter was from outside the United States and it is clear as you can look at our numbers our growth rates are much higher outside the US. We realize we must do well in these markets to continue to grow.",1
"As a follow-up, you mentioned the plans for store openings in 2010 but what are your expectations for non-retail store CapEx? And if it is growing what types of projects should we think about?",1
We expect our CapEx in fiscal 2010 to be about $1.9 billion. That is unchanged from what we told you a quarter ago. About $400 million of it is in retail and about $1.5 billion not in retail. The areas we are focused on that exclude retail are of course our facilities and infrastructure and some of our systems areas and manufacturing.,1
"On the App Store, could you provide more color regarding what you are hearing from developers and customers? What you are seeing in terms of any changes, paid versus free apps? I think you gave a 3 billion download number. You are probably not going to give me an update but how have you seen the success of App Store?",1
"A follow-up question, perhaps, you could talk aboutâ¦you made a comment that your corporate clients that are looking at the iPhone more than doubled. Are people writing specific apps? Is there any anecdotal evidence that the iPhone sales within corporate are helping to drive overall Mac acceptance in the office environment? Is there anything you could give us in terms of sort of your corporate strategy?",1
When we see your latest creation will you perhaps give us visibility to things like whether it is in your guidance or not or so on and so forth to help us understand a little bit better how to think about how things will unfold from an analyst and investor point of view?,1
"I think it is early to comment on the halo from the iPhone to the Mac. As you know, we did feel strongly that did exist with the iPod. On a corporate basis, the iPhone really saw a significant acceleration of acceptance and exploration after we announced the iPhone 3GS and associated operating system in the mid part of the year. As I think Peter mentioned in some of his opening comments, 70% now of the Fortune 100 are actively piloting it or deploying it. If you look internationally, about 50% of the FT 100 is doing the same.",1
"So there are someâ¦those are some pretty staggering numbers when you think about the time period we have been in the business. It is only 2.5 years. Several of the requests from enterprises really implemented in the June/July timeframe, so we feel great about what is happening there.",1
"For the iPhone, have you seen any change in the financial model when you moved beyond the first carrier in some of the more mature markets where you've had exclusive agreements in the past?",1
"Primarily, what we have seen in the countries that we have done this in is that the sales are largely incremental as we add carriers. As you know, we have added carriers in the U.K. I think when our market share comes up there you will see a significant change. We have added carriers in France. I am pleased to say the latest GFK numbers for market share in France is over 60% for the October/ November timeframe. We have added carriers in the Scandinavian countries and saw market share increases. I think we will see the same in Canada when we get the market share numbers for Canada.",1
"That is what we have seen so far. However, we have also selected in most cases countries that we thought that would happen in. I donât want to imply that would happen in every market or that we are headed that way in every market.",1
Is there something you are doing specifically either on the sales side or on the technical support side to drive higher corporate growth on the iPhone segment?,1
Stay tuned.,1
I wouldnât want to take away your joy of surprise on Wednesday when you see our latest creation. So I will delay that for Wednesday.,1
"Yeah. Thanks very much. Maybe shifting to the iPhone. There's now a number of competitors coming to the market, many who will have their own sort of variance on the sort of, say, customer experience that iPhone was famous for initiating, and that includes things like Android and Windows and the Palm Pre. I was just wondering, beyond what's obviously been a powerful leadership in applications, how do you think about sustaining that leadership and brand in the face of these competitive developments in this sector going forward?",1
"As you know, we have a long-standing process of not commenting on pending litigation.",1
"We typically do not disclose units by country, but given the visibility of this one, I will do so. We started selling in China as you know at the very end of October and beginning of November. Earlier this month, we had cumulatively activated over 200,000 units, crossing the 200,000 unit mark. We ramped the point of sales across that period of time to end at about 1,500 by the end of Q1, and we are very, very focused on the quality of the point of sale and customer experience. We would prefer to move slow because we are building the brand for the long-term and we are very much focused on the long-term in that market because we think there is significant potential there.",1
I wouldnât want to forecast where sales will go and what we may or may not do from a partner point of view. We are very happy with working with China Unicom. They are an excellent partner for us and I am thrilled we are underway and have got about 2.5 months experience under our belt.,1
Can you comment on your comfort level with iPhone inventory? You mentioned you expect iPhones to be seasonally down but the channel inventory was up. I know you were kind of below where you wanted inventory to be last quarter. So perhaps you could just clarify is 4-6 weeks the right number? Are you right in the middle of that? How do we think about iPhone channel inventory?,1
"You are correct. Channel inventory grew by about 230,000 units from the beginning to the end of the quarter to around the 2.7 million level. We are completely comfortable with it. We could have sold a lot more and elected not to because we are managing inventories very tightly. I am not putting a target of 4-6 weeks out there on iPhone. We do have that target on iPod as you know and we have a target on the Mac of 4-5. We ended under the Mac number and we ended within the iPod number despite although we did pull the inventory on the iPod down from beginning to end of the quarter by about 150,000 units.",1
"On the phone, we obviously had expansion through the quarter in terms of the number of carriers we are dealing with within some existing countries and also launched some larger countries like China and Korea and really needed more inventory than we started with. I feel totally comfortable with it.",1
"Any update on litigation, obviously relatively a high profile suit from Nokia. Can you give us an update at all or equally importantly can you confirm that there is no potential material risk to Appleâs financials from litigation expense or settling patent infringement lawsuits going forward?",1
"On the gross margin side, I think you are guiding on your new GAAP basis for gross margins to be down from 40% last year to 39% this year. How do we think through that given the iPhone gross margins are 60%. iPhones just grew [ph] 100%, year-over-year growth is going to be very strong. So you are going to have a huge mix shift to iPhone. How do we reconcile the notion on a year-over-year basis that overall company gross margin should be going down given that mix shift?",1
"In view of the fact you did indicate in your release and I think probably everybody except some folks on the moon know you are going to be unveiling something exciting soon, how do you feel maybe about sort of new product category opportunities ahead? Can you see things that are as large an opportunity for Apple as has been the iPhone, the iPod and the Mac? Or is that perhaps setting expectations too high?",1
"As I commented before, it is very difficult for us to talk about gross margin on a year-over-year basis because we are in different product cycles, different commodity cycles, currency and mix could be different and other factors as well. I do see our gross margin coming down a bit on a sequential basis form where we ended the December quarter and I can go back through that if you want but I answered that in Richâs question.",1
The next question comes from the line of Charles Wolf â Needham & Co.,1
"The iPhone application approval process has come under constant criticism for delays and reportedly arbitrary guidelines for acceptance. First, is the problem the model itself where Apple acts as the gatekeeper or is it the implementation of the model? Second, have you received any feedback from iPhone owners who shop at the store? Would they also prefer an alternative?",1
"I think it is important to keep this in some perspective that we have over 100,000 apps on the store and that over 90% of the apps we have had have been approved within 14 days of submission. We created the approval process to really make sure that it protected consumer privacy, safeguards children from inappropriate content and to avoid apps that degrade the core experience of the phone. Some types of content such as pornography are rejected outright. Some things like graphic combat scenes and action games might be approved but with an appropriate age rating. Most of the rejections however are actually bugs in the code itself. This is protecting the customer and the developer to a great extent because they donât want customers unhappy with the app. So I think what you have here is something that the noise on it occasionally may be much higher than the reality with over 90% approved within 14 days I think is pretty good.",1
"On the second question, have you got any feedback from the iPhone owners who buy at the stores and are they comfortable and happy with it?",1
I have not. In the research I have seen from our team I donât see it in the research.,1
"We have done a tremendous amount on the product side itself by implementing tons of features in the latest OS for iPhone that several of our enterprise customers had desired. Secondly, we have added sales staff to assist the carrier staff in selling the iPhone in several of the major geographies. So, yes, this is a key focus of ours.",1
"On the longer-term strategy, could you give us an update in terms of the recent acquisitions of Lala and Quattro? How should investors think about Appleâs longer-term strategy? Will it be only content and device driven or could we see more of a services type flavor longer-term? Any help there would be greatly appreciated. On the tax rate, given the increasing contribution to growth from international, should we think about tax rate having downward pressure as we go into the back half of this year?",1
I will start with the second question first. We did have a lower tax rate for the first quarter and your tax rate is really the one part of the guidance where under GAAP it is annual. So at this point we expect our tax rate to be about 29% for fiscal 2010 and when I last spoke with you in October we had expected it to be 30%. So yes it is down a point and it is down a point because of a higher mix of foreign earnings. So if foreign earnings were to grow beyond what we had thought about for the year then our tax rate may very well be lower.,1
"Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1
"We saw a small year-over-year increase in Pro software sales. This is Final Cut, Aperture and Pro Audio space. We use that as a proxy for how many of our Pro machines are being sold in that space. I would still describe that as an economically challenged area currently. I hope we see improvement as we move forward but I am not projecting it.",1
"If I can switch gears to education, what are your latest thought there? In the past, you have made comments about the tax revenues and budgets have gotten worse and certainly the headlines have become even worse since the last time we talked to you. What is going on with K-12 that helps you above the problems that are there and in higher ed with declining endowments is the student purchase segment, your focus on higher ed, if you could give us some more color on K-12 and higher ed and what is happening right for you and why it would be helpful?",1
"The great thing is, and I am talking about the Mac here specifically, was the combination between K-12 and higher ed in the US was up 16% year-over-year and that is the best growth rate we have seen since before the recession began. So we feel great about how we came out of the quarter. We had very few orders that were supported with stimulus funds. I would hope that would change in the future although I donât know if that will happen or not.",1
"Our whole ed business is based on we really understand teaching and learning and student achievement at a very deep level and we think we are the only technology company that really gets it. So we sell a lot more than just boxes as many other people do. I think with staying very focused on that market, I think we can continue to do well and I was thrilled to see the results we hit last quarter.",1
"Thanks to everyone for your participation. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on Apple.com/Investor and by telephone. The numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. Please enter the confirmation code 4035751. These replays should be available beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. PT today.",1
"Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude todayâs presentation. We thank everyone for your participation.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information or speak as of their respective date. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.",1
"In terms of our Quattro and Lala acquisition, we acquired Quattro because we wanted to offer a seamless way for our developers to make more money on their apps, especially those that are providing free apps. We occasionally acquire small companies from time to time for their technology and talent. That is why we do it.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the outstanding results of our December quarter. The performance of our business was extremely strong, as we sold more Macs, iPhones and iPads than in any previous quarter in Apple's history. And as a result, we're thrilled to announce all-time record quarterly revenue and earnings.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $26.7 billion, an increase of more than $11 billion over the prior December quarter's result, representing growth of 71%. The robust revenue growth was fueled by record iPhone, iPad and Mac sales. Operating margin was over $7.8 billion, representing 29.3% of revenue. Net income was $6 billion, which exceeded our previous quarterly earnings record set in the September quarter by $1.7 billion, and represented 78% growth over the year-ago quarter's earnings. These results translated to earnings per share of $6.43.",1
"Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new quarterly record with sales of 4.13 million Macs, representing 23% growth over the year-ago quarter. That's almost 8x IDC's most recently published estimate of 3% growth for the PC market. We experienced strong sales growth in each of our geographic segments, with over 50% growth in both the Asia-Pacific region and Japan. The growth was fueled primarily by strong demand for the new MacBook Air, which was launched in October, as well as continued strong sales of MacBook Pro. Customers love the new thin and light unibody design of the MacBook Air, and the impressive responsiveness and reliability of its solid-state storage, while MacBook Pro continues to provide customers tremendous speed and high-performance graphics at an excellent value.",1
"We ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory. We opened the Mac App Store in January 6, bringing what we've learned from iOS Apps to Mac users to make discovering, installing and updating apps easier than ever. The Mac App Store is available in 90 countries, and features more than 1,000 free and paid apps in categories like education, games, graphics and design, lifestyle, productivity and utility. We've been very pleased with customer response, with over 1 million downloads on the first day alone.",1
"Moving to our music products. We sold 19.4 million iPods compared to 21 million in the year-ago quarter. We experienced continued strong sales of iPod touch, which grew 27% year-over-year and accounted for over 50% of all iPods sold during the quarter. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD, and iPod continues to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK. We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.",1
"The iTunes Store generated another strong quarter with revenue exceeding $1.1 billion, thanks to strong sales of music, video and apps. We were extremely pleased to bring the legendary music of the Beatles to iTunes during the quarter and to introduce movies to the iTunes Store in Japan. And as we announced a few weeks ago, iTunes users are now renting and purchasing over 400,000 TV episodes and over 150,000 movies per day.",1
"In the Pro segment, could you update us on what you are seeing in the Pro segment since the last call? And as you look at the upcoming year, are you seeing improvement there? And if you do, is it helping the Mac Pro product line or is it helping sales of higher end MacBook Pros and the iMac? What did you see after the quarter, what do you expect?",1
"No, we are in infancy and I honestly donât know. We will have to see. We are going to work hard to provide the developers a great opportunity and we will see where that takes us.",1
Do you anticipate mobile advertising as being a significant revenue earnings contributor going forward or is this primarily a similar strategy as we have seen in iTunes and the App Store to drive demand for your devices?,1
"We work with Google in some areas and we compete with them in others. I think mobile advertising is just in its infancy. And with the great folks we have acquired and are going to be working with at Quattro, we look forward to providing our developers with a great opportunity from mobile advertising and that is what we know at this point.",1
I wanted to follow-up on earlier questions around mobile advertising in the application store. Specifically I am interested to understand what role if any you expect mobile advertising to have on your business model going forward? Can you characterize the changing relationship you have with Google as they have entered the smartphone space?,1
The next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank.,1
"Actually, I did not say that. That is actually not something that we have the time to try and figure out. As I said before, the team did just an amazing job to implement this new accounting within four months of the FASB ratifying it. The comments I made was our revenue of $15.68 billion under the new accounting exceeded the guidance we gave under the old accounting by over $4 billion. About half of that was driven by the amazing performance of the business and the other half was driven by the accounting change.",1
"I think you said it but I might have missed it, what revenue and EPS would have been under the previous accounting policy for the December quarter?",1
"In Japan, what is going on there is the iPhone has been a runaway hit. The iPhone was up over 400% year-on-year during the quarter. So that is what is driving the huge revenue growth you see in Japan. The Mac growth is above market but we believe we can do better in the Mac area in Japan. In Asia Pacific, Asia Pacific is doing an incredible job with the Mac growing 54%. It is our highest performing region in terms of growth. In the iPhone, the iPhone was up over 500% in Asia Pacific. As you probably remember, we talked about China on this call, but we also added Korea during the quarter, and we added several other countries throughout the year after Q1 of last year. iPhone really drove an incredible amount of the total revenue growth you see on the (inaudible) of 140%.",1
"For you, on Asia Pac and Japan, CPU sales were particularly strong. And moreover if you look at Asia Pac the revenues were about, the year-over-year growth rate was about three times than the CPU units. I just want to try and understand in Japan and Asia Pac, it looks like a pretty strong mix up in terms of computers but also just underlying strength. I wanted to hear if you could offer some color around that please.",1
"We are recognizing the deferred revenue from the $25 deferral each quarter in our balance sheet. So to help you be sure you have your models correct on a go-forward basis, we essentially recognized about $110 million in the December quarter for the $25 we deferred for all the iPhones we sold over the past two years. So we deferred $25 on the 8.7 million iPhones that were sold in the quarter, so that came out of revenue. But then we put in about $110 million from the amortization that occurred from the past few yearâs sales. Does that make sense?",1
"Let me clarify this for you. I talked about how we are accounting for an iPhone sale in two elements, the first being the initial hardware and software that somebody would buy and walk out of the store with. The second element being the right to receive future upgrades when and if they become available. We have estimated the selling price of that upgrade for iPhone to be about $25. So in terms of what we have done here in the revision of our financial statements we went back and applied a $25 deferral to all iPhones we had sold in the past and a $10 deferral to Apple TV. When you look at all the things we put out today in terms of income statements, balance sheet and cash flow, you will see there is substantially less deferred revenue on those balance sheets and no deferred costs.",1
"A clarification on the new accounting standard, will there be $25 of deferred revenue going forward on the sale of iPhones as well? I know it is on a look-back basis.",1
"There are some fixed costs but the variable cost structure is high and we are investing a lot in these stores. As revenue grows, we are just continuing to invest more to give both developers and customers the best experience in the world.",1
"As the revenues start to ramp there, are there any kinds of fixed costs that would grow with it on a like for like basis that would prevent it from being good operating leverage?",1
"We have told you our philosophy on cash. I donât have a change in that philosophy to share with you today but nothing is forever. Regarding the App Store and the iTunes stores, we are running those a bit over break even and that hasnât changed. We are very excited to be providing our developers with a fabulous opportunity and we think that is helping us a lot with the iPhone and the iPod touch platform.",1
"We have seen a number of industry revenue forecasts for applications and just given kind of the expected explosive growth there I am just wondering if that is still a break-evenish type of business as you look forward over the next couple of years? A question on the cash, as the economy starts to improve hopefully and we move away from cash preservation, can you talk about uses of cash because it seems like it can fund the M&A and then some solely through cash flow? In particular I am curious about the companyâs appetite for share repurchases, dividends, etc.",1
"With regard to the iPhone, could you talk a little bit more about China, in particular did that meet your expectations in the quarter? How is that looking into this year? Do you think you will add more partners over time in that area as well?",1
"Well, the cash generation in the quarter was very, very strong. GAAP earnings under the new accounting, which have a very small deferral for iPhone and Apple TV were just under $3.4 billion and our cash increased by $5.8 billion. Our cash flow from operations was about equal to our total cash generation. That really speaks to the power of our business model and our asset management. To answer your question, I donât see that changing. We are very, very good with our receivables and inventory management and with payables as well. We have been operating on a cash conversion cycle in a range of about a negative 40 days for as many years as I can remember and I am not looking to see that change.",1
Your free cash flow was $5.88 in the quarter if I calculated it right and higher than EPS. Do you see any dynamic that would change the way you are generating free cash flow versus earnings and do you think that will remain the case over the long-term?,1
"Welcome to the Apple Incorporated first quarter fiscal year 2010 earnings release conference call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, maâam.",1
"That's something, Charlie, that we're not disclosing. But, we are thrilled with the App store. You know, it was a pleasure last week to be able to say that we surpassed 500,000. And, it's huge to say that there's more than 15000 Apps now on the store, which I would point out is again up more than 10000 since we last talked to you on this conference call.",1
"Yes. And, with respect to the App store, are you going to continue to report revenues within iTunes or are you going to separate that out at some point in the future?",1
"At this point, it's part of iTunes and no plans to make a change at this point.",1
"Thank you, Charlie. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store. There is a webcast on apple.com/investor and by telephone and the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and the confirmation code is 4939950. These replays will be available beginning at approximately 5 pm Pacific Time today.",1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling. He's at 408-974-1896 and financial analysts can contact either Joan Hooper or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570 and I'm at 408-974-5420. And, thanks again, for joining us.",1
"Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation. We do thank everyone for your participation and have a wonderful day.",1
"Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2009, and the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 filed earlier today. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"The iTunes store delivered a record breaking quarter with strong sales of music, video and apps. iTunes has the worldâs largest online music catalog with a selection of 11 million songs. iTunes also features over 8,000 Hollywood films including 2,000 in HD video, 10,000 music videos and over 50,000 TV episodes. The App Store continues to be an unparalleled success with more than 3 billion downloads to date by iPhone and iPod touch users in 77 countries. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4-6 weeks of iPod channel inventory on a look-forward basis.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are thrilled to report our best quarter ever. We posted Appleâs highest quarterly revenues and earnings and set new records in sales of Macs and iPhones.",1
We are shipping the best products in our history and customers love them. Today we are reporting our current results as well as all historical comparisons under the new accounting principles we discussed with you on our last earnings conference call which I will explain in detail after going through the highlights of our record breaking December quarter.,1
"Revenue for the quarter was $15.68 billion, growing 32% from the prior December quarterâs results and surpassing our previous quarterly record by almost $3.5 billion. Operating margin was Appleâs highest ever at $4.73 billion representing 30.1% of revenue. Net income was $3.38 billion, up 50% over the year-ago quarter and was almost $850 million higher than our previous quarterly record. Earnings per share were $3.67.",1
"Turning to the details of our results, I would like to begin with our Mac products and services. We generated record Mac sales of 3.36 million, beating our previous record set in the September quarter by over 300,000. Quarterly Mac sales grew 33% year-over-year and this compares extremely favorably to IDCâs latest published estimate of 17% growth for the market overall in the December quarter. We are extremely proud of this result and believe our Mac hardware and software are providing outstanding innovation and value that our customers really love.",1
"Response to the new iMac introduced in October was very strong contributing to 70% year-over-year growth in desktop sales. Customers are thrilled with the iMacâs tremendous new features, including enhanced performance, wide screen LED display, wireless keyboard and new magic mouse. Portable sales were also robust during the quarter increasing 18% year-over-year based on strong sales of both MacBook and MacBook Pro.",1
"We experienced very strong demand following the October launch of the new MacBook, which features a durable, unibody design, brilliant LED display, glass multi-touch trackpad and enhanced performance. The new iMac and MacBook launches fueled very strong results in our education business during the quarter. Overall Mac sales through our US education channel increased 16% year-over-year as we set new December quarter records for both K-12 and higher ed channels. We began and ended the quarter with between 3-4 weeks of Mac channel inventory.",1
"And my last question. There's been, I believe, 500 million downloads from the App store. I'm curious what percentage were paid and what percentage were free?",1
"I don't have that in front of me and I'm sorry. But, we did set a record as I said in my prepared remarks for one-to-one sessions in the quarter.",1
Okay. And how many one-on-one sessions did you have during the quarter?,1
Hold on Charlie. 249.,1
"Yes, I have a couple of questions. On the Apple stores, what was the average number of stores open during the quarter?",1
"From Needham & Company, we'll hear from Charles Wolf.",1
Thank you Mike. Could we have the next question please?,1
"So, you're comparing 9% to a negative number. So, I feel very, very good about that. If you look at our unit share in retail in the US, in December it was over 16. If you look at the revenue share it was over 32 and Apple was number 1 in revenue share in retail in the US. I think those are all fantastic results and we're extremely proud of them.",1
"If you look at the Mac and the slight decline sequentially and you think about the macroeconomic environment from fiscal Q4 to fiscal Q1, I think it's a fantastic result, so I'm thrilled with it. I'll remind you we grew 9% on a sell-in basis and we did take down the channel inventory some in addition to that. And the market as projected by IDC, IDC has said that the worldwide market actually contracted.",1
"And lastly, I realize you do have a transition to laptops but given that quarter-over-quarter Macs were down 3%, and amidst a launch of new Macs, can you give us a sense of what you're thinking about either regarding your guidance or just generally on Mac trends going forward?",1
"I don't want to talk about any specific company. I'm just making a general statement that we think competition is good. It makes us all better. And we are ready to suit up and go against anyone. However, we will not stand for having our IP ripped off, and we'll use whatever weapons that we have at our disposal. I don't know that I can be clearer than that.",1
"Because, it seems until Palm came out, many of the other players had in fact negotiated carefully around your multi-touch IP; whereas, the Palm device particularly seems to almost directly emulate the kind of touch interfaces that you had innovated and that Steve, when he launched the phone, talked about patented. Is that to what you're referring with regarding to ripping off IP?",1
I thought it might be. And that's the reason I want to go ahead and get that out.,1
"That was actually my next question because,",1
"We approach this business as a software platform business, and so I think we approach it fundamentally different than people that are approaching it only from a hardware point of view. And so, as I've said before, we're very, very confident with where we are competitively. We are watching the landscape. We like competition. As long as they don't rip off our IP and if they do we're going to go after anybody that does.",1
"If you look at others, I think when you think about having multiple variations of displays, multiple variations of resolutions and input methods, and many different forms of hardware, it's a big challenge to a software developer and is not very enticing for them to build a different App for every one of these things. But, we shall see what people will do.",1
"Mike hi, its Tim. I would say first of all, it's difficult to judge products that are not yet in the market. But the iPhone has sold over 17 million units thus far. It's received the highest overall customer satisfaction of products from many different surveys. And, we've said since the beginning software is the key ingredient and we believe that we're still years ahead on software. And I would include in that software umbrella, the Applications Store, and you can see the explosion that has happened in applications with over half a billion downloads.",1
"Now I will turn to our music products. We sold almost 21 million iPods compared with 22.7 million in the year-ago quarter. As expected, sales of our traditional iPods declined year-over-year but the very strong 55% year-over-year growth in sales of iPod touch resulted in an overall iPod ASP increase of 9% and revenue growth of 1%. Our share of the US market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD and iPod was the top selling MP3 player and continued to gain share internationally year-over-year in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.",1
"I would now like to turn to the iPhone. We are thrilled to have sold over 8.7 million iPhones during the quarter which is a new company record and an increase of 100% over the prior December quarter. This compares extremely favorably to Canalysâ latest published estimate of 35% growth for the smartphone market overall in the December quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales and carrier payments was $5.58 billion during the quarter compared to $2.94 billion in the year-ago quarter. The sales value of the 8.7 million iPhones sold in the quarter was over $5.4 billion resulting in an ASP of about $620.",1
"I will talk about all three of our product areas. For Mac, we would expect to see a sequential decline, which is very typical in the March quarter from the December holiday quarter. For iPod, we certainly would expect to see the same. Given that our expectations of traditional iPod sales will decrease over time, the sequential decline may be a little bigger than we have seen in prior years. We donât have a lot of experience with iPhone, but are certainly gaining some, and given the quarter ended after Christmas, we would expect to see a sequential decline in the March quarter from December, which is we think very seasonal.",1
"The accounting change accounted for the other half of the $4 billion. We focused our attention on converting to the new accounting which was really complex and I am so proud of how hard the finance team and the systems teams worked to accomplish this so quickly after the FASB amended the standards. So we didnât spend as much time really diving into the gross margin but I can tell you that the December quarter gross margin of 40.9% was a bit better than we expected heading into the quarter due to three factors. The first is we did experience a better commodity environment than we had anticipated. Second, we had better warranty performance and lower freight and duty costs than we had planned and we did benefit from the higher revenue and leveraged some of our fixed costs.",1
"The Mac was impressive, 33% growth, third quarter consecutive extraordinary [ph] Mac growth rate, I should assume by a combination of new products and a better economy but before the slow down, Macs were growing at 41% in June of 2008. Besides the law of large numbers, is there any reason to think the Mac growth rates wonât continue in these just reported ranges?",1
"We are thrilled to see the Mac at 33% growth rate. It is about two times the market and so I wouldnât want to predict what will occur in the future. As you know, we donât do that other than to give guidance. I would point out that some of the markets that we are in, the Mac group was absolutely spectacular. As an example, Italy, France, Switzerland and Spain all grew at 40% or higher. Australia was up over 70%. China was up almost 100%. So there are some markets out there that we are doing extremely well in, and we will just have to see where it takes us. We believe that we are shipping the best products that we have ever shipped before and are very confident about the pipeline.",1
"Regarding AT&T, 40% of your iPhone users are on AT&T by our estimates. Obviously AT&T has had a lot of bad press here recently and obviously that impacts your brand. Can you remind us what the benefits and the virtues of sticking with a single carrier in the US are?",1
"First of all, AT&T is a great partner. We have been working with them since well before we announced the first iPhone to get it out. I think it is important to remember that they have more mobile broadband usage than any other carrier in the world. In the vast majority of locations, we think that iPhone customers are having a great experience from the research that we have done. As you know, AT&T has acknowledged that they are having some issues in a few cities and they have very detailed plans to address these. We have personally reviewed these plans and we have very high confidence that they will make significant progress towards fixing them.",1
"I wanted to ask you about gross margin. I know you have switched over the accounting but it looked like under the prior accounting method. your gross margin would have been somewhere north of 37%, which is well above the 34% you guided to on the last call. I was hoping you could, as you usually do give us a sense of the puts and takes on gross margin during the December quarter and for the March quarter as well?",1
"Well, as you know, we are reporting our results for the December quarter today under the new accounting principles, and the guidance we provided as you said was under the historic principle, so the two are not comparable. Let me try and help. Actually I would like to first start with revenue. Our actual revenue of $15.68 billion exceeded the guidance that we gave under the old accounting principles by over $4 billion and roughly half of that was attributed to the performance of the business. We set records for Mac and iPhone shipments, had a great iTunes quarter and by the way iPod touch up very strongly 55%.",1
"As we go forward to the March quarter, I would expect gross margin to be about 39%, down a little bit sequentially as a result of three factors, all about equal in size. The first is we do expect a higher component environment and some other costs in the March quarter relative to what we saw in December. Second, we will have a very typical seasonal decline in revenue, so we wonât have as much leverage on our fixed costs and we wonât have the benefit of a couple of small one-time items we had in the December quarter not repeating. Finally, the US dollar has strengthened here in the new calendar year from where we were in the December quarter and that is having an impact as well.",1
"We added 17 new carriers during the quarter including Canada Bell and Telus, Orange in the U.K., China Unicom and KTF in South Korea. We now have iPhone distribution in 86 countries and we are very pleased with the international growth we achieved as we have added both countries and carriers. We experienced very strong year-over-year growth in a number of major markets including Japan, Australia, the U.K., France and Germany.",1
Could you elaborate on which component prices you expect to be up in the March quarter?,1
"For this quarter compared to last quarter, we are continuing to see the market is very constrained in DRAM, and we do expect that will drive prices higher sequentially. For the vast majority of the other commodities, it appears to us that the excess inventories that caused prices to fall last year have been depleted and are more in a supply/demand balance. The one exception to that is the 3.5 inch drive which will be supply constrained.",1
"First of all, a clarification, did the guidance you gave include any impact from unannounced products this quarter?",1
I think you are maybe alluding to our event on Wednesday. I donât have anything to share with you today. So please stay tuned.,1
"Off of that, now that the iPhone business has been around for several years, could you provide some color on how we should think about the March quarter seasonality? Also could you give us an update on how we should think about channel inventory within the iPhone business?",1
"First of all, on the channel inventory question, we ended the quarter with approximately 2.7 million units in the channel. I would remind you that includes demos and also includes in-transit inventory that has been invoiced at the carrier and so we probably count that in a more conservative manner than others might. In terms of seasonal, I think Peter will comment on that.",1
"In closing, we are extremely pleased with the results of our record breaking December quarter, including our 32% revenue growth and 50% net income growth. We remain focused on delivering the industryâs most innovative products and great value to our customers and we are incredibly excited about our new product pipeline.",1
We expect revenue to be between $11-11.4 billion compared to $9.1 billion in the March quarter last year under the new accounting principles. We expect gross margin to be about 39% reflecting approximately $40 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $1.64 billion including about $190 million related to stock based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $30 million reflective of the short-term interest rate environment and we expect the tax rate to be about 29%. We are targeting EPS in a range of about $2.06 to $2.18 compared to $1.79 in the year-ago quarter under the new accounting principles.,1
"Looking ahead to the March quarter, I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We will provide a range of guidance for the March quarter under the new accounting principles.",1
We are very pleased by the FASB's ratification of the new accounting principles as we believe they will better enable us to reflect the underlying economics and performance of our business and therefore we will no longer be providing non-GAAP financial measures.,1
"Therefore, in our revised financial statements, a significant portion of the revenue from such transactions has been recognized as of the time of sale. The results of the December quarter as well as the revised results in each of the past three fiscal years reflect the new accounting principles. In addition to filing the 10-Q for the December quarter with the SEC today, we also filed an amended 10-K for 2009 to reflect the retrospective application of the new principles to prior years. To assist analysts and investors in their understanding of the impact of the new principles, we also filed an 8-K today to provide quarterly financial schedules reconciling the application of old and new accounting principles to historical income statements, balance sheet, cash flow from operations, deferred revenue and summary data information. These schedules will also be available later today on our website at Apple.com/Investor.",1
"The new accounting principles also alter the way we previously accounted for some other aspects of the business, including some education and other shipments and some international carrier payments, none of which were significant. For example, under the old accounting principles, we were required to recognize revenue from certain education sales over multiple years because we could not meet the strict criteria required for immediate revenue recognition. Under the new accounting principles, we are permitted to make estimates of the value of the elements that need to be deferred and recognized over time.",1
"As a result, substantially all of the revenue and all of the product costs, including warranty expense from the sales of iPhone and Apple TV are recognized at the time of sale. Therefore, you will see much less deferred revenue and no deferred cost on the revised balance sheet related to past iPhone and Apple TV sales. The accounting for OpEx is unaffected by the new accounting principles.",1
The new rules require us to estimate the standalone selling price for the software upgrade right and to recognize that amount ratably over our estimated 24 month life for iPhone and Apple TV. For all periods to date from 2007 we have estimated the selling price of the upgrade right to be $25 for iPhone and $10 for Apple TV. The difference between the total iPhone or Apple TV sales price and the $25 or $10 estimated selling price of the upgrade right is recognized as revenue immediately.,1
"Under subscription accounting, revenue and associated product cost of sales were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight line basis over 24 months, which resulted in significant amounts of deferred revenue and deferred costs on the balance sheet. The new accounting principles require us to account for the sale of each iPhone and Apple TV as two deliverables. The first deliverable is the hardware and software provided at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the right to receive future, unspecified software upgrades and features when and if they become available.",1
"Consequently, the financial results of each quarter from fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2009 have been revised. We believe retrospective adoption provides analysts and investors the most comparable and useful information and better reflects the underlying economic performance of our business. Under the old accounting principles, we were required to account for sales of both iPhone and Apple TV using subscription accounting because we indicated we might provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge.",1
"As we discussed on our last conference call, in September 2009, the FASB amended the accounting standards that determine how we account for sales of iPhone and Apple TV, as well as certain other types of transactions related to revenue recognition arrangements with multiple deliveries. We elected to adopt these new accounting principles on a retrospective basis in the December quarter. Because we began selling both iPhone and Apple TV in fiscal 2007, we retrospectively adopted the new accounting principles as if the new accounting principles had been applied in all prior periods.",1
"Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $39.8 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to $34 billion at the end of the September quarter, an increase of $5.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was about $5.8 billion. Our investment priority for the cash continues to be preservation of capital which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short-dated, high quality investments and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio.",1
Total gross margin was 40.9%. Operating expenses were $1.69 billion and included $168 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&E was $33 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 29% better than we expected due to a higher mix of foreign earnings.,1
"We hosted a record 50.9 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 46.7 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 9%. We also conducted 586,000 personal training sessions and sold 280,000 memberships to our one-to-one program. We now have 52 [ph] stores outside the US and we are on track to open 40-50 stores in fiscal 2010, at least half of which we expect to be in international locations. We remain very pleased with the performance of our stores and customers continue to truly value the great experience our stores provide.",1
"We opened 10 new stores during the quarter including the spectacular new stores at the Louvre in Paris and on the Upper West Side in New York bringing us to a total of 283 stores in 10 countries. We also completed 32 store remodel projects during the December quarter bringing us to 100 remodels in the calendar year. With an average of 278 stores open during the December quarter, average revenue per store was $7.1 million compared to $7 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment margin was $481 million or 24.4% up from $409 million or 23.4% in the year-ago quarter.",1
"I would now like to turn to the Apple Retail stores. Revenue in the quarter was $1.97 billion compared to $1.75 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 13%. Our stores sold a record 689,000 Macs compared to 515,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the December quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.",1
"Satisfaction and demand for the iPhone in the corporate environment remains strong. In fact, business customers have ranked iPhone the number one smartphone in JD Powersâ Customer Satisfaction Survey for the second year in a row. We have continued to see a rapidly growing number of enterprise CIOs who have added iPhones to their approved device list. Specifically we now have over 70% of the Fortune 200 deploying or piloting iPhone. This penetration has doubled since the iPhone 3GS first shipped this past summer.",1
"For more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2005, as well as the Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter.",1
Please also note that any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's call should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of Apple's GAAP results. A reconciliation of any GAAP and non-GAAP measures discussed will be posted on Apple's website at www.apple.com/investor.,1
"In connection with SEC rules on corporate disclosure, Apple is making this analyst call open to the media and general public by broadcasting the call live over the Internet.",1
"Revenue from other products grew 30% over last year thanks to Apple Watch. We have expanded distribution to 60 countries and introduced bands in beautiful new colors for spring, so customers can personalize their watches in more ways with a range of colors, styles, and materials. Our customers are very happy with Apple Watch, with 451 Research measuring 94% customer satisfaction.",1
"Turning to Services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 20% over the March quarter last year, thanks primarily to the continued strong performance of the App Store, with revenue growing 35% to a new all-time high. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 90% more global revenue than Google Play in the March quarter, up from a 75% lead in 2015. Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes Store's, the average amount spent per customer reached a new all-time record in the March quarter.",1
"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4 million Macs compared to 4.6 million last year, a decline of 12%. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales across the industry, but we believe we gained market share. Despite the overall market slowdown, we generated double-digit Mac growth in a number of markets, including Russia, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and the UAE.",1
"And just last week we updated the MacBook, our thinnest and lightest Mac, with the latest processors, faster graphics, faster flash storage, and longer battery life. We think our customers are going to love this update. We ended the quarter within our four-week to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.",1
"Turning to iPad, we sold 10.3 million units compared to 12.6 million units in the year-ago quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by about 200,000 units, and we exited the quarter within our five-week to seven-week target range.",1
"In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 78% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by IDC indicates that iPad accounts for 72% of the U.S. commercial tablet market, comprising business, government, and education.",1
"iPad customer metrics are also extremely positive. In February, 451 Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2. And among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 59% plan to purchase an iPad, more than three times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad, and the June quarter purchase intent of 71%.",1
"We're also making great progress with our enterprise initiatives. IBM now has engagements for more than 200 deployments of native iOS apps for large enterprise customers to accelerate mobile transformation. Our Mobility Partner program also continues to grow, with 108 partners across 20 countries.",1
"iPhone ASP was $642 compared to $659 in the year-ago quarter, with weak international currencies and very popular mid-tier and entry offerings contributing to the difference year over year.",1
"We see continued broad industry adoption of native iOS apps to transform how professionals do their work and serve their customers. For example, retail bankers are using iOS apps on iPads to greet and onboard customers, reduce queue times, and improve the customer experience. And in hospitals, doctors and nurses are using iOS apps on iPhone and iPad to share and communicate more effectively so that they can spend more time with patients and less time on administrative tasks.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $232.9 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $17.2 billion. $208.9 billion of this cash, or 90% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $15.5 billion in U.S. dollar denominated notes during the quarter, including our first green bond tranche to fund initiatives such as renewable energy and environmental design projects. We exited the March quarter with $72 billion in term debt.",1
"We returned $10 billion to investors during the quarter, including $2.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $7 billion on repurchases of 71.8 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We have now completed over $163 billion of the current $200 billion capital return program, including $117 billion in share repurchases.",1
"As Tim mentioned, today we are announcing the latest update to our program, which we are increasing to a total of $250 billion. Once again, we're allocating the majority of the expansion of the program to share repurchases. Given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, the board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $140 billion level to $175 billion. We will also continue to net share settle vesting employee restricted stock units.",1
"We also know that the dividend is very important to many of our investors who value income, and we are raising it for the fourth time in less than four years. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.52 per share to $0.57 per share, an increase of about 10%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today and is payable on May 12, 2016 to shareholders of record as of May 9, 2016. We continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. With $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters we expect to return $87 billion to our investors, which represents about 15% of our market cap at the current stock price.",1
"As in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with U.S. cash, future U.S. cash flow generation, and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly and solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This allows us to be thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of the program.",1
"iPhone's momentum in business markets continues to be very impressive. A recent survey by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, found that among U.S. corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPhones. That's the highest June quarter iPhone purchase intent ever measured by the survey and five points higher than a year ago.",1
"For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter compared to 61.2 million in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 16%. It was a particularly challenging comparison to the record quarter a year ago, when iPhone sales grew 40%, as we entered last March quarter in supply/demand imbalance, which was recovered during the quarter. Also, this year we reduced channel inventory by 450,000 units while we increased inventory by 1 million units a year ago. We have exited the quarter within our five-week to seven-week target range for channel inventory.",1
"The reach of Apple Pay also continues to expand following a very successful launch in China in the March quarter and last week's rollout in Singapore. Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than five times the transaction volume of a year ago and 1 million new users per week. There are more than 10 million contactless-ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay has launched to date, including over 2.5 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States, and more expansion of Apple Pay is coming soon.",1
"As we continue through the June quarter, I'd like to remind you that we measure the health of customer demand based on sell-through. Despite ending Q2 within our channel inventory targets, in light of the macroeconomic environment, we plan to lower our channel inventories in the June quarter. This will impact our reported revenue in Q3. Luca will provide more details on this in his commentary.",1
"Turning to the Apple Watch, unit sales met our expectations in the quarter. For some color on how we think about Apple Watch sales, we expect its seasonality to be similar to the historical seasonality of iPod, which typically generated 40% or more of its annual unit sell-through in the December quarter. We started shipping Apple Watch just one year ago, and it has quickly become the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world. In fact, unit sales of Apple Watch during its first year exceeded sales of iPhone in its first year.",1
"Last month, we refreshed the lineup for the spring with new bands and a new starting price point, and the response from customers has been great. Apple Watch is an increasingly essential part of users' lives, from responding to messages, managing calendars and navigating with maps, to helping them be more fit. And in some cases, the heart rate sensor has even helped save lives. We're really excited about the first year with Apple Watch. We have learned a lot, and we believe it has an exciting future head.",1
"We announced some fantastic new products during the March quarter. IPhone SE became available on March 31, so none of its sales were reflected in our second quarter results. But so far this quarter we're seeing terrific customer response. IPhone SE is the most powerful four-inch phone ever, and it's a great option for customers all over the world who want a compact phone with advanced features and a great price without compromising performance. Demand has been very strong and exceeds supply at this point, but we're working hard to get the iPhone SE into the hands of every customer who wants one as quickly as possible. The addition of the iPhone SE in the iPhone lineup places us in a better strategic position to attract even more customers into our ecosystem.",1
"We also unveiled the stunning 9.7-inch iPad Pro with cutting-edge performance and our most advanced display yet. The reviews of our new iPad Pros have been great, and we're hearing from customers that the features and capabilities in the new Pros make them both the ultimate upgrade for iPad owners and a great PC replacement. In the June quarter, we expect to see our best iPad revenue compare in over two years. IPad is the best selling, best reviewed, and most used tablet on the market. Customers tell us that they love iPad for its unique mix of portability, capability, and versatility, with over 1 million iPad apps in the App Store to help them work, play, learn, and create.",1
"We also announced CareKit, a new software framework that developers can use to help people take a more active role in their health by keeping track of their care plans, monitoring their symptoms and medication, and delivering the insights they need to make smart decisions about their health. We're very excited about the ways iPhone and Apple Watch are helping people lead healthier lives. We believe there's great promise here for the future, and we are very interested in where this can take us.",1
"As always, we're contributing to society beyond our products, promoting the use of renewable energy across our facilities and inside our supply chain and developing cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize recycling of the materials we use. We are unwavering in our commitment to protect the security and privacy of our customers and their data, and we're actively promoting inclusion and equality across our business.",1
"But before I turn over the call to him, I'll summarize by saying that the future of Apple is very bright. Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store. We're very excited about bringing together developers for our four major platforms at our Worldwide Developers Conference in June. We are forging ahead with important investments in research and development, in our infrastructure, and in our supply chain. We've made 15 acquisitions in the last four quarters to accelerate our product and Services roadmaps, and we're always on the lookout for companies with great technology, talent, and strategic fit.",1
"Gross margin was 39.4%, near the high end of our guidance range, thanks to strong cost performance. Operating margin was 27.7% of revenue, and net income was $10.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.90, and cash flow from operations was strong at $11.6 billion.",1
"Creating value for shareholders by developing great products and services that enrich people's lives will always be our top priority and the key factor driving our investment and capital allocation decisions. As our business continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, we are in the fortunate position to expand our capital return program again this year, as we have done each year since we started the program four years ago. Today we're announcing an extension of the timeframe of the program by four quarters through March of 2018, and we are expanding the total program size from $200 billion to $250 billion.",1
Luca has more details on this announcement and our results for the March quarter. Luca?,1
"Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the March quarter results.",1
"Revenue for the quarter landed within our guidance range of $50.6 billion compared to $58 billion in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 13%. As we had expected, our comparisons to last year were influenced by the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. As Tim said, in constant currency, our revenue declined by 9%.",1
"On a geographic basis, in Asia, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, but it declined in greater China and the rest of Asia-Pacific. However, our business in these two regions is faring better than the numbers might suggest. We had significant channel inventory reductions and currency weakness, which affected our reported revenue for both these segments.",1
"In Mainland China, revenue was down 11%, and the decline was 7% in constant currency terms. Keep in mind that we were up against an extremely difficult year-ago compare when our Mainland China revenue grew 81%. We remain very optimistic about the China market over the long term, and we are committed to investing there for the long run.",1
"As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $41 billion and $43 billion. The revenue guidance implies a year-over-year decline as we lap an incredibly strong June quarter last year where revenue grew 33%, due in part to accelerated iPhone upgrade purchases. This tough compare is compounded by the continued weak macro environment this year and the strong U.S. dollar, which affects our revenue growth in international markets.",1
"Embedded in this guidance is a planned channel inventory reduction worth over $2 billion, as we have elected to be prudent about our channel inventory position given the current macro environment. The guidance also reflects a range of possible scenarios related to how quickly we can get into supply/demand balance for iPhone SE. Due to these factors, our expected demand is greater than the revenue range implies.",1
"Sequentially, our guidance implies a revenue decline of 15% to 19%, which is comparable to the 17% sequential decline that we've averaged from the March to June quarter for the last three years, despite the anticipated channel inventory adjustments I just described. We expect seasonal sequential declines in iPhone and iPad sales and a sequential increase in Mac sales. We also expect iPhone ASPs to decline sequentially as we get farther from the launch of iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus and as iPhone SE enters the mix.",1
"And from an India point of view, if you look at India, and each country has a different story a bit, but the things that have held not only us back perhaps but some others as well is that the LTE rollout with India just really began this year, and so we'll begin to see some really good networks coming on in India. That will unleash the power and capability of the iPhone in a way that an older network, a 2.5G or even some 3G networks, would not do. And so the infrastructure is one key. The second one is building the channel out. Unlike the U.S., as an example, where the carriers in the U.S. sell the vast majority of phones that are sold in the United States, in India the carriers in general sell virtually no phones. And so it's out in retail, and retail is many, many different small shops.",1
"From a profitability standpoint, we had mentioned last time that when you look at it on a gross basis, so in terms of purchase value of these services, the profitability of the business is similar to company average. Of course, when you net out the amount that is paid to developers and you look at it in terms of what is reported in our P&L, obviously that business has a profitability that is higher than company average. We don't get into the specifics of specific products or services, but it's very clear it's significantly higher than company average.",1
"Yes, thank you. First for Luca, this is the worst gross margin guide in a year and a half or so. And over the last couple of quarters, you've talked about a number of tailwinds, including component cost, the lower accounting deferrals that went into effect in September. You just mentioned the Services margins are above corporate average. So the question is, are some of those tailwinds winding down, or is the significant guide down in gross margins for the June quarter entirely related to volume and the iPhone 5 SE? And then I have a follow-up for Tim.",1
"Katy, clearly the commodity environment remains quite favorable, and we continue to expect cost improvements. The other dynamics that you've mentioned are still there. Obviously, what is different and particularly as we look at it on a sequential basis coming out of the March quarter, we will have lots of leverage, and that obviously is going to have a negative impact on margins.",1
"And the other factor that's important to keep in mind is this different mix of products. And particularly when you look at iPhone, what I was mentioning to Gene earlier, I think we've got a couple of things that are affecting not only ASPs, but obviously they also affect margins. And it's the fact that we had a channel inventory reduction at the top end of the range, and we've got the introduction of the iPhone SE at the entry level of the range. And so when you take into account those factors, those are the big elements that drive our guidance range right now.",1
"Okay, thank you, and then a question for Tim. I appreciate the optimism around longer-term iPhone unit growth, but with developed market penetration in the â anywhere from 60% to 80%, the growth is going to have to come from new markets. You've talked about India. Can you just spend a little bit more time on that market? What are some of the hurdles you have to overcome for that to be a larger part of the business? When should we expect Apple to have more distribution and specifically your own stores in that country? Thanks.",1
"Katy, in the short term, let me just make a couple of comments on the developed markets just to make sure this is clear. If you look at our installed base of iPhone today versus two years ago, it's increased by 80%. And so when you think about upgrade cycles, upgrade cycles would have varying rates on it. As I talked about it in the comments, the iPhone 6s upgrade rate is slightly higher than the iPhone 5s but lower than the iPhone 6. But the other multiplier in that equation is obviously the size of the installed base. And so the nut of the idea is that I think there's still really, really good business in the developed markets, so I wouldn't want to write those off. And it's our jobs to come up with great products that people desire, and also to continue to attract over Android switchers. With our worldwide share, there's still quite a bit of room in the developed markets as well.",1
"And so we've been in the process â it's not something that we just started in the last few weeks. We've been working in India now for a couple of years or more, but we've been working with great energy over the last 18 months or so, and I'm encouraged by the results that we're beginning to see there, and believe there's a lot, lot more there. It is already the third largest smartphone market in the world. But because the smartphones that are working there are low end, primarily because of the network and the economics, the market potential has not been as great there. But I view India as where China was maybe seven to ten years ago from that point of view, and I think there's a really great opportunity there.",1
"We know that our revenue guidance falls short of market estimates for the third quarter. We believe the difference comes primarily from three areas: first, the $2 billion-plus channel inventory reduction I just mentioned; second, the effect of the channel inventory reduction and the launch of iPhone SE on iPhone ASPs, as well as the current constrained supply of iPhone SE; and third, different estimates for Mac, which we expect to grow sequentially at a rate similar to what we have experienced in the past June quarters.",1
"Yes, thank you. I have one and then a follow-up as well. My sense is that you talked about adjusting for the changes in channel inventory, that you're guiding for relatively normal sequential growth. And I think if you do the math, it's probably the same or perhaps a touch worse in terms of iPhone unit growth sequentially relative to normal seasonality between fiscal Q2 and Q3. I guess the question is, given that you should be entering new markets and you should see pronounced elasticity from the iPhone SE device, why wouldn't we be seeing something that was dramatically above normal seasonal in terms of iPhone revenues and units for this quarter?",1
"Maybe you could push back on me, but I can't help thinking that when Apple introduced the iPad mini in a similar move to move down-market, there was great growth for one quarter, and the iPad never grew again, and margins and ASPs went down. And it looks like you're introducing the SE, and at least on a sequential basis, you're not calling for any uplift even adjusting for channel inventory. And ASPs I presume will go down and certainly it's impacting gross margins, as you've guided to. So could you respond to, A), why you're not seeing the elasticity? And, B), is the analogy with the iPad mini completely misplaced?",1
"Toni, it's Tim. Let me see if I can address your question. The channel inventory reduction that Luca referred to, the vast, vast majority of that is in iPhone, and so that would affect the unit compare that you may be thinking about. The iPhone SE, we are thrilled with the response that we've seen on it. It is clear that there is a demand there even much beyond what we thought. And so that is really why we have the constraint that we have.",1
"And so do I think it will be like the iPad mini? No, I don't think so. I don't see that. I think that the tablet market in general, one of the challenges with the tablet market is that the replacement cycle is materially different than in the smartphone market. And so as you probably know, we haven't had an issue in customer satisfaction on the iPad. It's incredibly high. And we haven't had an issue with usage of the iPad. The usage is incredibly high. But the consumer behavior there is you tend to hold on for a very long period of time before an upgrade.",1
"We continue to be very optimistic on the iPad business. And as I had said in my remarks, we believe we're going to have the best compare for iPad revenue this quarter that we have had in quite some time. And so we'll report back in July on that one. But I think iPhone has a particularly different kind of cycle to it than the tablet market.",1
"Okay. And if I can follow up, Tim, you alluded to replacement cycles and differences between the iPad and the iPhone. My sense was when you were going through the iPhone 6 cycle was that you had commented that the upgrade cycle was not materially different. I think your characterization was that it accelerated a bit in the U.S. but international had grown to be a bigger part of your business, and replacement cycles there were typically a little bit longer. And so I'm wondering. If there was only a modest difference between the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6, how big a difference are we really seeing in terms of replacement cycles across the last three generations? And maybe you can help us. If the replacement cycle was flat this year relative to what you saw last year, how different would your results have been this quarter and the first half?",1
"Tim has talked about Apple Pay. It doesn't provide a meaningful financial contribution at this point, but as we look at the amount of transactions that are going through Apple Pay right now and we think ahead for the long term, that could be an interesting business for us as well.",1
"The question on Services, when we look at our Services business, it's obviously growing very well across the board. The biggest element and the part of the Services business that is growing very well, we mentioned 35%, is the App Store. It's interesting for us that our Music business, which had been declining for a number of quarters, now that we have both a download model and a streaming model, we have now hit an inflection point. And we really believe that this will be the bottom and we can start growing from there over time. We have many other Services businesses that are doing very well. We have an iCloud business that is growing very quickly, faster than the App Store from a much lower base, but I think it's important for us as we continue to develop these businesses.",1
"So on the ASPs, Gene, we mentioned that we're going to be down sequentially. And this is really the combination of two factors when we go from the March quarter to the June quarter. It's the fact that we are having the iPhone SE entering the mix, and that obviously is going to have a downward pressure on ASP. And also this channel inventory reduction that we've talked about, obviously the channel inventory reduction will come from higher-end models, and that is also affecting the sequential trend on ASPs.",1
"Gene, I think the iPhone SE is attracting two types of customers. One is customers that wanted the latest technology but wanted it in a more compact package, and we clearly see even more people than we thought in that category. And then secondly, it's attracting people who aspire to own an iPhone but couldn't quite stretch to the entry price of the iPhone, and we've established a new entry. And so I think both of these markets are very, very important to us, and we're really excited about where it can take us. I do think that we will be really happy with the new-to-iPhone customers that we see from here because of the early returns we've had. We are currently supply constrained, but we'll be able to work our way out of this at some point. But it's great to see the overwhelming demand for it. I'll let Luca comment on the ASPs.",1
"And one for Luca, can you talk a little bit about the Services segment in terms of what piece of the services is driving growth, and maybe a little bit about the profitability on a net basis versus a gross basis that you've referred to in the past? Thanks.",1
"Good afternoon. Tim, could you talk a little bit about the iPhone ASP trends? And specifically, you mentioned that the iPhone SE is going to impact it. But how are you thinking about the aspirational market share that's out there and your actual market share and using price to close that gap? Is it just the iPhone SE, or could there be other iPhone models that will be discounted to try to be more aggressive in emerging markets?",1
"Your other question was on M&A. Regardless of the first, we're always looking in the market about things that could complement things that we do today, become features in something we do, or allow us to accelerate entry into a category that we're excited about. And so as I said before, our test is not on the size. We would definitely buy something larger than we've bought thus far. It's more about the strategic fit and whether it's a great technology and great people. And so we continue to look and we stay very active in the M&A market.",1
"The next thing is with the iPhone SE, we have seen our ability to attract even more customers into the platform with an incredible product that is at a new price point for us with the latest technology, and so we're optimistic about attracting even more customers with that. We also look at our pipeline, and we're very excited about what's in our pipeline. And so all of those things make me optimistic.",1
"As we look at switchers, we're extremely excited that for the first half we set a record from switchers from other platforms, the largest we've ever seen in any six-month period before, so we've got traction there. And then on emerging markets, if you take a look at India, we grew by 56%, and we're placing increasing emphasis in these areas, where it's clear there will be disproportionate growth versus the more developed areas.",1
"The reason that we're optimistic is we look at the three places that iPhone sales come from. And from an upgrade point of view as I mentioned in my comments, we compare favorably, slightly better than the upgrade cycle that we saw on the iPhone 5s. We're lower than the iPhone 6, but I think all of us know that that was an extraordinary cycle that accelerated upgrades from 2016 into 2015. And so that comparable will be tough for this year, but that's a transitory thing.",1
"is mature, I think that the market, as you know, is currently not growing. However, my view of that is that's an overhang of the macroeconomic environment in many different places in the world. And we're very optimistic that this too shall pass and that the market and particularly us will grow again.",1
"Simona, hi, it's Tim. In terms of do I think the smartphone market",1
"Simona, let me give you the data points on the sell-through, and then I'll let Tim answer the strategic question. We had a channel inventory reduction that was worth a bit less than $800 million a year ago.",1
"And then the bigger question, Tim, was with the smartphone market now reaching a pretty mature growth phase, how does Apple think of itself going forward? Is it as a growth company, or is it a more mature tech company? And if it's still the former, how does that change how you think about M&A, especially given the position you're in with your balance sheet strategically?",1
"Hi, thank you so much. My first question was actually just a clarification in terms of putting in context that $2 billion in channel inventory reduction. What was that last year, just to help us make the comparison on a year-over-year basis?",1
First we'll hear with Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.,1
"We expect gross margins to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect continued cost improvements to be more than offset by the sequential loss of leverage from lower revenue and a different mix of products. We expect OpEx to be between $6 billion and $6.1 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%.",1
"Turning to the Mac, we met our sell-in expectations in addition to reducing channel inventory by about 100,000 units. Overall, the Mac continues to attract a large percentage of new customers. In our latest survey of major markets, over half of buyers were new to the Mac. And in some countries, the percentage is extremely high, like in China, where over 80% of customers were purchasing a Mac for the first time. We're confident in our Mac business and our ability to continue to innovate and gain share in that area.",1
"The Services business is powered by our huge installed base of active devices, which crossed 1 billion units earlier this year. As we discussed on this call in January, those 1 billion-plus active devices are a source of recurring revenue that is growing independent of the unit shipments we report every three months. In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over last year, accelerating from the 24% growth rate we reported in the December quarter.",1
"Now the good news is â the great news from my point of view is I think we're strategically positioned very well because we've announced the iPhone SE. We are attracting customers that we previously didn't attract. That's really great. And this tough compare eventually isn't the benchmark. And the installed base is up 80% over the last two years. And so all of those I think bode well. And the switcher comments I made earlier, I wouldn't underestimate that because that's very important for us in every geography. So thanks for the question.",1
"And just sort of a follow up on the iPad side. What do you think itâs going to take to reaccelerate iPads? The sellthrough was better than the sell in this quarter, but are we seeing cannibalization from the iPhone 6 plus and how are you sort of thinking about the IBM partnership as it relates to iPad?",1
"The Mac also had an unbelievable quarter in China, and Iâm particularly very happy with this, that Mac unit sales were up 31%. And like the rest of the world, or most of the rest of the world, IDC is projecting that PC sales in China contracted by 5% last quarter. And so once again bucking the tide.",1
"Also, in China, consistent with the company but at a much different rate, the App Store had a record quarter and grew over 100% year over year. And so you can see the iPhone, the Mac, and the App Store adding, and with the iPad in PRC, not in Greater China, but in the PRC, iPad had its best quarter ever, higher than all the others, and also grew in a market that contracted for the overall market.",1
"And so really and truly, itâs sort of everything you look at in China was extremely good. We have been working significantly on expanding our ecosystem there, and so we added Union Pay as a payment option for customers. We increased the iPhone point of sales to over 40,000 during the quarter. Thatâs up about 9% year on year. And more importantly than the total number, we are in many more cities than we were before.",1
"We worked significantly on our online store. Our online store revenue was up over three times year over year. As you probably heard us say before, weâve opened several stores in China recently. Weâre now at 21 in Greater China and weâre on track still to achieve 40 stores by the middle of next year. The online store will also be expanding from around 319 cities to where they can hit two day delivery to 365 cities. So adding about 50 new cities by the end of this quarter.",1
"And so the net is weâre investing a lot across the board in our infrastructure, in our products, on partnering with different companies. The Chinese developers are coming on in significant numbers. Weâve now made payments to developers in Greater China of almost $5 billion over half of which was in the last 12 months.",1
"And so you can see this enormous momentum building in the developer community there as well. And so lots of positive things, and you know, as you probably heard me say before, Iâve never seen as many people coming into the middle class as they are in China. And thatâs where the bulk of our sales are going. And so weâre really proud of the results there and continue to invest in the country.",1
"Number one, we have to stop having the situations where we sell through more than we sell in, where we donât have to have an inventory correction. That was over a million units. Two, have we had cannibalization? The answer is yes. Weâre clearly seeing cannibalization from iPhone and on the other side, from the Mac. And of course, as Iâve said before, weâve never worried about that. It is what it is. That will play out, and at some point, it will stabilize. Iâm not sure precisely when, but Iâm pretty confident that it will.",1
"Yeah, it was an incredible quarter. We were up 71% year over year. We set a record in China for revenues. We did that now in a quarter that included Chinese New Year, and so we have the help of a strong holiday season, much like the U.S. has a strong season in December. Chinaâs is obviously in the March quarter.",1
"The IBM partnership, I think, is in its early stages in terms of bearing fruit here, but everything I see I like on it. Iâm a big believer in the ability for iPad to play in a major way in enterprise. And so Iâm looking forward to seeing that play out as we move forward.",1
"If you look at the underlying data, it makes you feel a lot better than the sales do. And so things like first time buyer rates, the latest numbers from the U.S. are somewhere around 40%. And if you look at China, theyâre almost 70%. And so these numbers are not numbers that you would get if the market were saturated. And so I continue to believe, even though Iâve seen people write that, that I think that theory is not correct, and do not see that.",1
"We also see usage numbers that are off the charts, so far above competition itâs not even in the same planet. And we see customer satisfaction at or near 100%. And so these kind of numbers, along with intent to buy numbers, everything looks fantastic, the ecommerce numbers.",1
"And so my belief is that as the inventory plays out, as we make some continued investments in our product pipeline, which weâre doing, that we already have planned and have had planned for some time, between that, the inventory playing out, the enterprise starting to take over, I think still I believe the iPad is an extremely good business over the long term. When precisely it begins to grow again I wouldnât want to predict, but I strongly believe that it will.",1
"Luca, could you comment a bit about the factors that went into your decision on the capital return program, particularly the share repurchase part? For example, I would think youâre pretty well done in terms of taking U.S. cash down. So you are dependent upon cash flow in the U.S. as well as debt. And regarding debt, do you have a debt to EBITDA ratio in mind that you donât want to go over? Do you want to keep your AA rating? Is that important? Just other factors like capital spending needs, just curious what your thinking was.",1
"The logic has not changed over the years. We look at our business plans, we look at what we want to accomplish from product perspective. We look at the capital needs that we have to run the business and to grow the business. And then we see that weâre in this great position that we can return cash to shareholders.",1
"iPhone led the way. It was up over 70% year on year. And the current estimates from Kantar are that that would mean that we would gain more than 9 points of share on a year over year basis. And so by everything I can see, we did extremely well.",1
"Tim, can you talk a bit about what youâre seeing in China with 70% year over year growth in the Greater China revenue, and clearly very strong iPhone. If you can talk a bit about what consumers are saying, what the carriers are saying, in terms of demand and opportunity. Just any color, because clearly itâs quite strong.",1
"Next I'd like to talk about Services, which was our second largest revenue-generating category during the quarter. Setting aside the amount we received from a patent settlement in the December quarter, the March quarter Services revenue was our highest ever. Services revenue jumped 20% to $6 billion. App Store revenue was up 35% to beat last quarter's all-time record. And Apple Music continues to grow in popularity, with over 13 million paying subscribers today. We feel really great about the early success of Apple's first subscription business, and our Music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline.",1
"And so as you know, we donât make long term forecasts on here. We make forecasts for the current quarter. And so I donât want to make any comment about the consensus numbers. Honestly, I havenât even studied those. Weâve got enough to think about here.",1
"Yeah, sure. Our current estimate is that about 20% of the active installed base has upgraded to a 6 or 6 plus. And so as I look at that number, that suggests thereâs plenty of upgrade headroom in addition to we want to keep inviting over as many switchers as we can. So between both of those and the first time buyers as well, it seems really, really good right now.",1
And that will come from Tony Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.,1
"I just wanted to revisit the watch. Tim, I think youâve said, when you were talking about your new products, you said weâre âvery happy with the receptionâ and in response to a previous answer, you said, ârelative to demand, itâs hard to gauge with no product in the stores.â I would say relative to other product launches, where your commentary around demand was characterized by superlative after superlative, that assessment feels very modest.",1
"And part of the reason that I ask is A) are we reading you right in terms of that, but if we look at consensus, consensus is expecting that Apple will ship more watches in its first two quarters than it did iPad, despite, as you said, very limited distribution in terms of only selling through your store.",1
"So Iâm wondering if you could talk a little bit about putting those demand comments in context given that they do seem different from how youâve characterized product demand for other products, and how, if at all, we should think about modeling demand in the context, perhaps, of the iPad, which was your most recent significant new category.",1
"Iâm thrilled with it, Tony, so I donât want you to read anything Iâm saying any way other than that. So Iâm not sure how to say that any clearer than that. And in any situation, whether itâs the watch or in the past on iPad or on iPhone, when demand is much greater than supply, itâs difficult to gauge exactly what it is.",1
"I feel really great about it. The customer response, literally, from what Iâve seen, is close to 100% positive. And so itâs hard to imagine it being better.",1
Weâll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"You talked about the watch having lower margins in the third quarter, which is surprising A) I think in the context of price points that many people thought were higher, B) in the context of what luxury watches sell for, C) I think in terms of what estimated margins might be installed on accessories like your watch band.",1
"So Iâm wondering if you believe that the watchâs gross margins are being burdened by lower volumes and startup costs, and that you believe that as a category, watch margins will be, in total, including everything else that you sell with it, on a sustained basis, lower than the company average.",1
"Tony, weâre not going to guide to or give projections of gross margin outside of the current quarter. And so what we have right now, which is a situation, itâs not surprising to us, we knew we would be here, is that the watch gross margins for the current quarter that weâve included in the guidance that Lucaâs provided in the aggregate, are lower than the company average. And so that to us is intuitive that they would be. And so I think we must be just looking at it through a different lens than you are.",1
I guess the question is is there anything unique about it being in its first quarter that itâs providing that margin profile?,1
"In the first quarter with any new kind of product, you would always have learning and these sorts of things. Weâve had this with every product weâve ever done. And so again, weâre not guiding to what it will be over time. Weâre talking about what it is now. But you know, I would keep in mind that the functionality of the product that weâre making is absolutely incredible, the power of it.",1
"And I havenât even seen this, but generally, thereâs cost breakdowns that come out around our products that are much different than the reality. Iâve never seen one that is anywhere close to being accurate. And so if thatâs the basis for your comment, Iâd really dig on the data if I were you.",1
"We know Apple very well. We are very excited by the level of customer response that weâve got for our current portfolio. Weâre super confident about the pipeline of products and services that we have, and therefore, we believe that there is great value in our stock.",1
"And that is the reason why, again this year, weâre allocating the majority of the increase, which is the largest increase that weâve ever done, weâre increasing the program by $70 billion. And the vast majority of that weâre allocating to the share repurchase, because again, we believe thereâs great value in the stock.",1
"We also know, and understand, that we have several investors that value income. And so thatâs important for us to increase the dividend. And as weâve said in the past, we plan to continue to increase the dividend every year. And as weâve said in the past, we will come back at about this time next year and give you another update to the program, because we will have better information, and weâll be able to be very thoughtful about the size and the mix and the pace of the program.",1
"In addition, today's comments will refer to a metric we describe as the purchase value of services tied to our installed base. This is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our Investor Relations website at Apple.com/investor.",1
"And so where could it go? I donât want to speculate, but you can speculate probably as good as I can about where that can go. I think weâre on the early stages of just major, major changes in media that are going to be really great for consumers, and I think Apple could be a part of that.",1
"Thank you, Keith. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820, and please enter a confirmation code 8627838.",1

Financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570, and I am at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
"Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated second quarter fiscal year 2016 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for capital return and debt issuance. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2015, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we're reporting the results of a very busy and challenging quarter, and we're also announcing an update to our capital return program.",1
"From a funding standpoint, of course we have a very strong balance sheet. We do have some cash in the U.S. We will continue to generate cash in the U.S., but definitely a good portion of the program will be funded through debt. We will raise debt both in the U.S. and outside of the United States.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $50.6 billion, which was within our guidance range. Despite the pause in our growth, our results reflect excellent execution by our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in much of the world and difficult year-over-year comparisons. We saw continued currency weakness in the vast majority of our international markets. In constant currency, our revenue declined by 9% from last year, 400 basis points less than the reported decline of 13%. For the first half of the fiscal year, our revenue in constant currency was up 1% year on year.",1
"Despite challenges, there were a number of encouraging signs during the quarter. Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continued to grow strongly. We added a huge number of Android switchers and new-to-Mac customers, and we generated very strong growth from Services. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of our own expectations but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter when we saw an acceleration in iPhone upgrades and 40% iPhone sales growth over the previous year.",1
"To provide some additional color, iPhone sales come from three sources: customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models; customers who switch from Android and other operating systems; and customers who purchase a smartphone for the first time.",1
"As we look at each of these three sources of iPhone sales, we see a business that is healthy and strong. First, from an upgrade perspective, during the first half of this year the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate that we saw with iPhone 6, which as you know was a big contributor to our phenomenal revenue growth a year ago. Most importantly, our customers are incredibly loyal. A recent Kantar survey of U.S. smartphone purchasers indicated a 95% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured for any smartphone.",1
"Second, we continue to see a very high level of customers switching to iPhone from Android and other operating systems. In fact, we added more switchers from Android and other platforms in the first half of this year than any other six-month period ever.",1
"And third, with only 42% smartphone penetration of the global handset market today, iPhone is still attracting millions of first-time smartphone buyers each quarter, especially from emerging markets. For example, in India our iPhone sales were up 56% from a year ago.",1
"And so I think HBO in particular has some incredibly great content. And so weâre marrying their great content, our great product and ecosystem, and itâs clear from looking at the early returns - you know, weâve only been at this for a couple of weeks or so - that thereâs a lot of traction in there.",1
"First of all, I think itâs about giving the customer something they want and giving to them in Apples classic ease of use and in the product environments and the user interface that theyâre used to working in, in this case Apple TV.",1
"My follow up, Tim, Iâm gonna stay with you for a second, it sounds like HBO Now is a great opportunity today, and as you look out. If you could just speak more specifically, how we should be thinking about Apple as a conduit for something like HBO Now and other products. Is that a meaningful revenue opportunity without getting specific, and/or is it more about selling incremental devices, or is it about expanding the revenue pie as you look at opportunities like HBO Now?",1
"And so I think thatâs where we are. I hope weâre also beyond the middle class, but I donât have the data to suggest that thatâs the case or not the case. But itâs clear to me that the middle class statement has to be true.",1
"And so as I look at that, without having market research data on the demographics that youâre asking, itâs clear to me that it has to be coming from the middle class, because the upper income earners, thereâs only so many of those. And you canât grow those kind of numbers without getting significantly into the middle class.",1
"Hereâs what I would share with you, Keith, is that if you look in the emerging markets, our revenues were up 58% year on year. And this accounted for just slightly less than 40% of the companyâs revenue. If you look at BRIC within the emerging markets, BRIC countries were up 64% year over year.",1
"Tim, this is for you. You mentioned something in your past comment that you thought a lot of the iPhone sales were going into the middle class in China. And Iâm just wondering if you could elaborate on that and open it up more broadly speaking, to the emerging geographies. If you have demographics that you could talk about for your iPhone specifically, and where you think those phones are ending up. Because I think it does raise the question, as you look out over the next year or so, do you have the right price points for the demographic youâre hitting?",1
And next weâll go to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.,1
"Let me tell you, there are a number of reasons why our guidance for gross margins is lower than the actual for the second quarter. The first one is the loss of leverage, because of the sequential decline in revenue. We got the foreign exchange, we got as you said, a lower iPhone mix. And we got the Apple Watch. I think weâll leave it at that, and weâre not gonna get into more specifics. But those are the four reasons that drive the sequential decline.",1
"Okay great, and then Luca, just on the gross margin decline from the March quarter to June, I understand the currency point. I understand the iPhoneâs a little bit older. I guess of the iPhone and the watch impact, is the decline equally attributed to both those reasons, or is there something different going on?",1
"As I look at the number, my point from bringing it up is that thereâs a lot of people that havenât upgraded to a 6 and 6 plus. And so as I look at that, it screams that thereâs significant opportunity there. And thatâs before thinking about switchers and first time buyers.",1
"I donât have the comparisons in front of me, about the answers to either one of your questions. My understanding of what you asked was is the 20% number that Iâd mentioned in the question from Gene, how does it compare year over year, is it a lot different? I donât know the answer to that off the top of my head.",1
"Oh, sorry, yes. My second part of my question is, in the first six months of the 6 plus, is the gross number of new users to Apple, whether itâs new users or switches from Android, significantly growing year on year?",1
I missed the second part of your question totally. Can you get a little closer to your phone?,1
"My first question is for Tim. Tim, on the point you made about the 20% of the [unintelligible] being on 6 or 6 plus, are we right in interpreting the comment that thatâs a substantially lower number than at this point in previous cycles? And that would, I guess, argue for just a longer period of growth as the [unintelligible] upgrades? And then also, linked to that, just by the points youâre making on [unintelligible] iPhone users and [unintelligible] being higher, that number year on year, in the first six months, is really growing significantly year on year. Is that the right way to interpret that comment?",1
Next weâll go to Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.,1
"And you know, of course weâve got a very, very strong balance sheet. Weâve got a very open dialog with the rating agencies. And so we feel we have a lot of room for us to fund the program. So from a balance sheet standpoint, we feel very, very comfortable with the program that weâve announced today.",1
"There's a lot there. Let me just say I don't recall saying the things that you said I said about the upgrade cycle. Let me get that out of the way. Now let me describe without the specific numbers. The iPhone 6s upgrade cycle that we've measured for the first half of this year, so the first six months of our fiscal year to be precise, is slightly better than the rate that we saw with the iPhone 5s two years ago, but it's lower than the iPhone 6. I don't mean just a hair lower. It's a lot lower. And so without giving you exact numbers, if we would have the same rate on iPhone 6s that we did iPhone 6, it would be time for a huge party. It would be a huge difference.",1
"Thanks, Toni. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"Thanks. Good afternoon. Peter, given gross margin did come in at the low end of guidance this quarter and youâre looking for another downtick in June, can you just rank for us the biggest factors that are limiting the margin recovery even as I assume costs are coming down to the new products? And then, I have a follow-up.",1
"As some people are doing when you begin to combine the watch revenues with the revenues for AirPods, and as you know, this was the first full quarter of shipments for AirPods. It's still very much in the ramping mode, and we're not coming close to satisfying the demand. And then add the Beats products that a group of our customers really enjoy as well, and look on the trailing 12 months â so this is not a forecast â that business was well into the Fortune 500. And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far. The watch hasn't out very long and AirPods has been out there for three, four months, and so we feel really great about it.",1
"Okay, thanks, Luca, and then I had a follow-up for Tim. Tim, I wanted to just ask. The Services revenue keeps growing, and of course the profit contribution from that is growing. And we've also at the same time I think seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain key technologies, let's call them, that maybe you want to penetrate the market with. I just wonder if you could just comment a little bit on your strategy there in terms of the usage of that extra profit contribution from that Services business, how you intend to apply it to the rest of the business. Thank you.",1
"Rod, the way that we think about pricing is we come up with a price that we think is a good value for the product that we're delivering, and we do that on the hardware side as well as on the Services side. And so that's how we think about it. We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to subsidize the other or vice-versa.",1
"Thanks, Rod. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"From UBS, Steve Milunovich.",1
"Thank you. Tim, could you comment on the opportunity in wearables? The watch, some people consider disappointing, had what seems to be a very good quarter, and ironically the competition almost seems to be fading in that part of the market right now. The AirPods of course are doing well. Do you see wearables: A), expanding over time into a broader product line; and B), increasingly being independent of the iPhone longer term?",1
"Thanks for the question. We have seen the watch as a really key product category for us since before we launched it. We took our time to get it right, and we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. And we're really proud of the growth of the business. The watch units more than doubled in six of our top ten markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter. And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it.",1
"Where does it go? I wouldn't want to comment on that, but we do have a really great pipeline here. And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth, the watch area is really hard. It in essence from an engineering point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. And so I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it. But we're very committed to it and believe that â it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger. Thanks for the question.",1
"As we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores, particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently two things. We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot. And I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we value in this last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. So this very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on our stores, and that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits.",1
"Thank you. And then there was a â you mentioned the 451 Research survey. They did have a couple findings that were interesting. One is a nine-year low in iPhone purchase intent, and that might just be where you are in the cycle. And the other was a declining retention rate in the U.S. toward 80%. Any comment on either of those and whether you're concerned?",1
"I only glanced at it, and so I haven't had time to study it. But in general, what we are seeing, we're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone, which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones. And so that part is clearly going on, and it could be what's behind the data. I don't know, but we are seeing that in full transparency.",1
"Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"From Bernstein, we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi.",1
"Yes, thank you. I have two as well. First, Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your recent decision and the rationale for withholding royalty payments to Qualcomm. And really specifically, I wonder what you believe is the risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response, such as withholding modem chip sales or potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world. And I'd like to understand your perspective on whether either of those are real risk to any degree. And why would Apple potentially take on those risks just in advance of what will arguably be your most significant and largest product launch in history?",1
"Anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what are called FRAND terms. FRAND stands for fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. That's both the price and the business terms. Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple. And so I don't believe that a â I don't believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see.",1
"What we're also seeing as we look at people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time. And we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. People start at a certain level and then they tend to spend more over time. And so obviously, the combination of people spending more over time and adding more people that are now actually spending on the stores contributes to this 40% growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year-over-year basis.",1
"And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we talked about 150 million. So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores. It's quite impressive to add 15 million subscriptions in 90 days.",1
"Thank you, Katy, a lot of questions. Let me take them one by one. Let me start with our performance for the March quarter, which we were very happy with. As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially. And this is in spite of the fact, as you know, that we lose leverage as we go from the December quarter to the March quarter. The foreign exchange headwind on a sequential basis was 100 basis points. Obviously, that was also a negative. And as you said, we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the memory side, particularly on NAND and DRAM. To offset that, and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities. And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through the year, that is of course also helping, given the profile of our gross margin for Services. So that answers the question around Q2.",1
"As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall and in China. They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter. And traffic â which for us is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell â traffic was up 27% year on year. And now seven of our top ten highest traffic stores in the world are in Greater China. And so that's the set of things that went in our direction, so to speak.",1
"On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now. So we didn't get any benefit in our P&L, in our margins, during the March quarter, and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either.",1
"Okay, thank you. And just a follow-up for Tim, as you noted in your remarks, the iPhone 7 Plus demand, it's selling incredibly well. And this was a product that was pretty severely supply-constrained in the December quarter. And I just wonder whether there are any lessons learned as you go forward into future product launches around how you manage the timing of announcing a product when there are supply constraints, and how you might work with the supply chain differently around ramping some of these components that have particular difficulties around the yields early on.",1
"Katy, one of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. There was â wound up that demand was much stronger to the iPhone 7 Plus than we had predicted. And so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred early this past quarter.",1
"What did we learn from it? Every time we go through a launch, we learn something. And you can bet that we're brushing up our models, and we'll apply everything we learn to the next time.",1
"Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China and give us some more color, especially as you're going through the year? And then obviously you won't talk about the next product launch, but just are there any shifts in demand with Greater China down 14%? Was it all iPhone, or a mix? Anything you can provide, and then I have a follow-up.",1
"Yes, thanks for the question, Shannon. We saw in Q2 a performance that combined with Q1 to form the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus, we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before, compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus. Also, the Mac business did extremely well. The Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China, and we had extremely strong Services growth during the quarter in China.",1
"On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind. And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. Also, where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones. And so that's the set of things on the plus and minus side.",1
"Yes, I'll take it, Rod. We don't disclose into the number of subscriptions. Of course, we're just giving you the total count of subscriptions that are out there. Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. There is some level of overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very, very large, obviously less than 165 million. But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in. It's a large number.",1
"We did perform about where I thought we would. At least I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter, and it was. What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth, but improve â but make more progress. And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there.",1
"Great, thank you. And then I don't know if Luca wants to take this, but thoughts on cash usage. You increased your program, but you still have I think $160 billion of net cash and obviously continue to generate cash. So I'm curious as to, given some of the commentary that's come out of the administration, which I think most companies were expecting some sort of return, how do you generally think about what you need to run the business from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a strength perspective as we look forward to what hopefully will come through?",1
"Shannon, you know how we run our capital return program. We've been pretty consistent during the last five years. Essentially for the last five years, the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors. That's what we've done with the program until now, and the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction. We know how much we need to invest in the business. We will never underinvest in the business. We're in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have. And given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of the free cash flow to investors.",1
"It's difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen. The program that we're announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country, and there's a lot that still needs to happen there, and we'll see. Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change.",1
"From JPMorgan, Rod Hall.",1
"Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start off just going back to the 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if you could comment on the unique number of users there. And I think you had made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user was up, or maybe that was you, Luca. But if you guys could just talk about any more color around that average revenue per user, it would be interesting to us. And then I have one follow-up to that. Thanks.",1
"In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. You don't know how much to pay. And so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, and there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there. And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that. Unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount, but right now we're depending upon the courts to do that. And so that is the thinking.",1
"The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value. And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is. It's not â it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don't think that's right, and so we're taking a principled stand on it. And we strongly believe we're in the right, and I'm sure they believe that they are. And that's what courts are for. And so we'll let it go with that.",1
"Thank you. I was wondering if I could just follow up a little bit on iPhone demand. If I try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra week last quarter, I think sequentially iPhones declined about 27% if I make those adjustments. And that's actually quite a bit lower than the normal seasonality we would see from Q1 to Q2, which is typically closer to 20%. I understand your comments around China, but your comparison was 40 points easier this quarter relative to last quarter. And the growth rate improved only marginally, I think, when you adjust for the extra week. And then you made a final comment around a pause on iPhones.",1
"We believe the availability of Apple Pay at major transit systems have been a key driver of adoption among commuters and in March, we launched Express Transit with Apple Pay in Beijing and Shanghai, the second and third largest transit systems in the world. Apple Pay is already the most successful mobile transit payment system in Tokyo, which has the busiest transit system of all.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the Associated Press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thank you, Nancy, and to everyone joining us, welcome. We're proud to announce the results of a very successful quarter today, setting new March quarter records for both revenue and earnings. We generated $61.1 billion of revenue. That's up 16% from last year, making it our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. Our performance was broad-based, with iPhone revenue up 14%, services up 31% and wearables up almost 50%. We grew in each of our geographic segments, and in Greater China and Japan, revenue was up more than 20%.",1
"iPhone's second quarter performance capped a tremendous fiscal first half with $100 billion in iPhone revenue, an increase of $12 billion over last year, setting a new first half record and achieving our highest first half growth rate in three years. iPhone gained share during the quarter based on IDC's latest estimates for the global smartphone market.",1
"And customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each week in the March quarter, just as they did following its launch in the December quarter. Since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, this is the first cycle in which the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular.",1
"Q2 was our best quarter ever for services and momentum there continues to be incredibly strong. Revenue topped $9 billion for the first time, up more than $2 billion over last year's March quarter. We had all-time record revenue from the App Store, from Apple Music, from iCloud, from Apple Pay and more, all of which are a powerful illustration of the importance of our huge active installed base of devices and the loyalty and engagement of our customers.",1
"Across all our services, paid subscriptions surpassed 270 million, up over 100 million from a year ago and up $30 million in the last 90 days alone, contributing to the overall increase in services revenue. Apple Pay continues its strong growth with active users more than doubling and transactions tripling year-over-year.",1
"With the launch of Brazil in April, Apple Pay is now available in 21 markets and we expect Norway, Poland and Ukraine to launch in the next several months.",1
"So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on, was the below sequential, at least by my calculation, growth rate in Q2 attributable to a pause? And can you characterize what you think upgrade rates are doing, perhaps broadly by geography, to help us better understand what might be happening, or whether there are competitive dynamics that also are at play here that, again, might be contributing to that pause and that sequential decline that I referenced? Thank you.",1
"This was another outstanding quarter for our wearables business, which includes Apple Watch, Beats and AirPods with combined revenue of almost 50% year-over-year. Looking at its revenue over the last four quarters, our wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 300 company.",1
"Apple Watch had another great quarter with revenue growing by strong double digits year-over-year to a new March quarter record. Millions of customers are using Apple Watch to help them stay active, healthy and connected and they have made it the top selling watch in the world.",1
"We launched carrier support for Series 3 with cellular in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Thailand during the quarter with more markets on the way. And now with Watch OS 4.2, there are more features than ever before. For example, in addition to tracking your workouts and heart rate, skiers and snowboarders can record runs, see vertical descent and calculate speed, as well as contribute data directly to the Apple Watch activity app.",1
"AirPods are incredibly popular and we're seeing them in more and more places, in the gym, in coffee shops, wherever people are enjoying music on their Apple devices. This product is a runaway hit, and we're working hard to meet the incredible demand.",1
"We started shipping HomePod in February, and it's widely recognized as having the best audio quality for its size and class. HomePod is a breakthrough speaker that delivers amazing sound, and we believe it will change the way people listen to music at home. It's currently available in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and we're looking forward to adding new features to HomePod and introducing it to more markets around the world soon.",1
"In March, we announced new products for the education community, including updating our most popular iPad with support for Apple Pencil. It empowers students to be even more creative and productive, from learning to code to sketching ideas and jotting down handwritten notes to marking up screenshots.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, share repurchases, dividends and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that we'll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Good day everyone, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414. And financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570, and I am at 408-974-5420. And thank you again for joining us.",1

Please enter confirmation code 3540172. And these replays will be available by approximately 5:00 PM Pacific Time today.",1
"Great, thanks so much for the detail. That's greatly appreciated.",1
"The 4G network investment really began rolling in in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know. But they are moving fast. They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive.",1
"We think it's a great opportunity too, and so we're bringing all the things that we brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in, and that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth. Phil [Schiller] was just over there opening a developer center last quarter, and so there are a ton of things going on there. And we agree that we are underpenetrated there. Our growth rates are good, really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. And so we're putting a lot of energy in, just like we have in other geos that eventually wound up producing more and more. So I'm very excited about it.",1
"Thank you very much and congratulations on returning to growth consistently. That's great. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments you mentioned India was growing double digit, which is great. But I believe if you look at geographic information, India is really underpenetrated from an Apple reception perceptive, but yet they have LTE, you have the iPhone SE, a lower priced iPhone. Do you think that say this next 12 â 18 months is going be a turning point, or is it more you need to work with the government to have Apple-owned stores or production there? Or what's it really going to take to get India going along because we think it's just truly a great opportunity?",1
Jim Suva with Citigroup.,1
"We make it a point not to forecast by geo. We just provide a current quarter forecast. But as hopefully you've seen as we began to give you more information about India, we've been investing quite a bit. We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts, and it is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the United States. And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. And so that and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there.",1
"Thank you, and then just for Tim. Tim, you've been excited about the India market for some time and have made strides in establishing a retail, manufacturing, and R&D presence there. So just curious as you look at that market and the rollout of 4G there, is it reasonable for us to assume that Apple can sell something on the order of 10 million to 20 million iPhones there next year and then grow from there?",1
"As you know, Simona, we do not provide guidance around units and around channel inventory reduction, but our goal is always to have the right amount of weeks of inventory in the channel. And if you look at our history over the last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory in the June quarter, so I think it's a fair expectation to have.",1
"Hi, thank you. I had a question for Luca first. Last year, you had a 4 million-unit channel inventory reduction for the iPhone in the June quarter. So just curious what you're expecting for this year just so we have an apples-to-apples comparison as we think about your guidance.",1
We'll go to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.,1
"In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders ever in any six-month period in the first half of this year, first half of this fiscal year to be precise. And we saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen. And so in four of the five operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth. And it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which is growing incredibly fast around the world. And so that's kind of the color I would add there, and hopefully some of that is useful for you.",1
"There are a lot of questions there. Let me give you some color as I see it. In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units. And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. Last quarter, I'm sure other folks remember, was a 14-week quarter, and so you have to adjust the rates last quarter to get at what the underlying sell-through growth was. And so I think that when you do that, you're going to find that actually the year-over-year performance is similar between the quarters.",1
"As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter. Again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage. We also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter, and the cost pressures on memory will remain. We expect to offset partially these impacts with other cost efficiencies, and again, with a mix shift towards Services. The impact on NAND and DRAM will continue to be there, and we expect it to be there. You know we don't guide past the June quarter, but we expect it to be there for the time being.",1
"Yes, thanks. My first question is for Luca around gross margins. How were you able to expand gross margins sequentially and guide rather seasonally for the June quarter in light of what's going on in the memory market. And maybe if you can, comment in particular whether the hold back of payments to Qualcomm is benefiting you at all on gross margins year on year, and also whether your contracts around commodity prices is likely to hit gross margins by more in the back half of this calendar year.",1
"From Cross Research Group, we'll hear from Shannon Cross.",1
"iPhone sales were line in line with our expectations, and we're thrilled to see the continued strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus with its beautiful large display and dual-camera system. Our active installed base of iPhones grew by double digits year over year. And based on the latest data from IDC, we gained market share in nearly every country we track.",1
"The only thing I would add, Rod, is I think there are a growing number of people in both parties that would like to see comprehensive reform, and so I'm optimistic that it will occur. It's just a matter of when. And that's difficult to say, but I think most people do recognize that it's in the U.S.'s interest to do this.",1
"Thank you, Rod. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store and webcast on Apple.com/investor and via telephone. The numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820, and please enter confirmation code 7495552. And these replays will be available by approximately 5:00 PM Pacific time today.

"Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated second quarter fiscal year 2017 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for capital return and debt issuance. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2016, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.",1
"Today we are reporting strong March quarter results, with accelerating revenue growth and earnings per share up 10% over last year. We feel great about this performance. Revenue was $52.9 billion, near the high end of our guidance range. Global revenue was up 5% year on year, with growth accelerating from our December quarter performance. That's despite a $1 billion year-over-year revenue headwind from foreign exchange in the March quarter and a larger iPhone channel inventory reduction this year versus last year.",1
"Late in the quarter, we released the stunning (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition versions of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in recognition of 10 years of our partnership with RED. This relationship has given our customers an unprecedented way to contribute to the global fund and bring the world a step closer to an AIDS-free generation. We've seen wonderful customer response to these eye-popping new iPhones.",1
"Yes. Rod, these are new regulations. We are in the process of assessing them. Frankly, from first read, we don't anticipate that they're going to have any material impact on our tax situation. Some of them relate to inversion transactions, so obviously that's not an issue for us. Some of them are around internal debt financing, which is not something that we use, so we don't expect any issue there. As you know, we are the largest U.S. taxpayer by a wide margin, and we already pay full U.S. tax on all the profits from the sales that we make in the United States. So we don't expect them to have any impact on us.",1
"For the second quarter in a row, our Services revenue topped $7 billion, and it's well on the way to being the size of a Fortune 100 company. We're very happy to see the deep level of customer engagement with the Apple ecosystem across all of our services.",1
"App Store momentum is terrific, with revenue growing 40% year over year to an all-time quarterly record. The number of developers offering apps for sale on our store was up 26% over last year, and we're thrilled to see their success.",1
We also saw double-digit revenue growth from Apple Music subscriptions and iCloud storage and overall very strong growth in the total number of paid subscriptions for our own services and the third-party content we offer on our stores. Paid subscriptions now exceed 165 million.,1
"Apple Pay is experiencing phenomenal traction. With the launch of Taiwan and Ireland in the March quarter, Apple Pay is now live in 15 markets with more than 20 million contactless-ready locations, including more than 4.5 million locations accepting Apple Pay in the U.S. alone.",1
"We're seeing strong growing usage as points of acceptance expand, with transaction volume up 450% over the last 12 months. In the UK, for example, points of acceptance have grown by 44% in the last year, while monthly Apple Pay transactions have grown by nearly 300%. In Japan, where Apple Pay launched last October, more than 0.5 million transit users are completing 20 million Apple Pay transactions per month. And we're always excited to see our partners bring their customers new ways to use Apple Pay. You can now even send a Starbucks gift card via iMessage with just a touch.",1
"We're seeing great momentum from our powerful advances in Messages. In fact, at one point during the Super Bowl in February, customers were sending 380,000 Messages per second, more than double the previous year. A few weeks ago, we introduced Clips, a new app that's another great example of how we're continually making our products even more engaging, and it's off to a great start. With Clips, it's fun and easy to combine video, photos, and music on an iPhone or an iPad into great-looking expressive videos with great visual effects and titles just using your voice, then share your clips with friends through the Messages app or on social media.",1
"On tax reform, maybe I can continue, and I'll let Tim provide more color, but we've been strong advocates for comprehensive corporate tax reform in this country. We continue to do that. We think a reform of the tax code would have significant benefits for the entire U.S. economy, and we remain optimistic that we're going to get to a point where we can see that tax reform enacted. At that point in time, of course, we would have much more flexibility around optimizing our capital structure and around providing more return of capital to our investors.",1
"Okay, great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask you about the tax situation a little bit. Treasury obviously has made some rule changes, and I wonder maybe if, Luca, you could comment on what the impact to Apple from those is, if anything; and, Tim, maybe more broadly, how you guys see the tax situation for Apple looking forward? Thanks.",1
"As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $450 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%.",1
"And then when you look at our SG&A portion of OpEx for the March quarter, it was actually down slightly. So obviously, we think about it, and of course we look at our revenue trend and we take measures accordingly. And when you look at the guidance that we provided for the June quarter, that 10% year-over-year increase that I mentioned to you for the March quarter goes down to a range of 7% to 9% up. And again, the focus is on making investments in R&D and continuing to run SG&A extremely tightly and in a very disciplined way. As you know, our E-to-R, expense-to-revenue ratio, is around 10%. It's something that we're very proud of. It's a number that is incredibly competitive in our industry, and we want to continue to keep it that way. At the same time, we don't want to underinvest in the business.",1
"Thank you very much. I have a couple questions. One, Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China? I know the Greater China revenue I think was down 26%. You did talk about Mainland China. But just if you could, talk about some of the trends you're seeing there and how you think it's playing out, and maybe your thoughts on iPhone SE adoption within China as well.",1
"Shannon, thanks for the question. If you take Greater China, we include Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mainland China in the Greater China segment that you see reported on your data sheet. The vast majority of the weakness in the Greater China region sits in Hong Kong. And our perspective on that is it's a combination of the Hong Kong dollar being pegged to the U.S. dollar, and therefore it carries the burden of the strength of the U.S. dollar. And that has driven tourism, international shopping, and trading down significantly compared to what it was in the year ago.",1
"If you look at Mainland China, which is one that I am personally very focused on, we are down 11% in Mainland China on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, we're only down 7%. And the way that we really look at the health or underlying demand is look at sell-through. And if you look at it there, we were down 5%. And keep in mind that that's down 5% on a comp a year ago that was up 81%.",1
"And so as I back up from this and look at the larger picture, I think China is not weak as has been talked about. I see China as may not have the wind at our backs that we once did, but it's a lot more stable than what I think is the common view of it. And so we remain really optimistic on China. We opened seven stores there during the quarter. We now are at 35. We'll open five more this quarter to achieve 40, which we had talked about before. And the LTE adoption continues to rise there, but it's got a long way ahead of it. And so we continue to be really optimistic about it and just would ask folks to look underneath the numbers at the details of them before concluding anything. Thanks for the question.",1
"Okay, thanks. And then my second question is with regard to OpEx leverage or thinking about when I look at the revenue, your revenue is below our expectations, but OpEx is pretty much in line. So how are you thinking about potential for leverage, I don't know, cost containment maybe when macro is bad and revenue is under pressure? And how are you juggling that versus the required investment you need to go forward?",1
"Shannon, it's Luca. Of course we think about it. We think about it a lot. And so when you look at our results, for example, our OpEx for the quarter, for the March quarter was up 10%, which is the lowest rate that you've seen in years. And when you look within OpEx, you actually see two different dynamics. You see continued significant investments in research and development because we really believe that's the future of the company. We continue to invest in initiatives and projects ahead of revenue. We have a much broader portfolio than we used to have. We do much more in-house technology development than we used to do a few years ago, which we think is a great investment for us to make. And so that part we really need to protect and we want to continue to invest in the business.",1
"Than you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"I think, Rod, you're probably indirectly asking about our trough comment, if you will, from last quarter. And when we made that, we did not contemplate or comprehend that we were going to make a $2 billion-plus reduction in channel inventory during this quarter. And so if you factor that in and look at true customer demand, which is the way that we look at it internally, I think you'll find a much more reasonable comparison.",1
"Thank you. Tim, I first wanted to ask you about Services, and how do you view Services? You've obviously highlighted it the last two quarters. Do you view it going forward as a primary driver of earnings, or do you view it â you mentioned platforms in terms of your operating systems, which I would agree with. And in that scenario, I would argue it's more a supporter of the ecosystem and a supporter of the hardware margins over time and therefore somewhat subservient to hardware. So it's great that it's growing, but longer term, I would view its role as more creating ecosystem that supports the high margins on hardware as opposed to independently driving earnings. How do you think about it?",1
"The most important thing for us, Steve, is that we want to have a great customer experience. So overwhelmingly, the thing that drives us are to embark on services that help that and become a part of the ecosystem. The reality is that in doing so, we have developed a very large and profitable business in the Services area. And so we felt last quarter and working up to that that we should pull back the curtain so that people could â our investors could see the Services business both in terms of the scale of it and the growth of it. As we said earlier, the purchase value of the installed base services grew by 27% during the quarter, which was an acceleration over the previous quarter. And the value of it hit just â or was just shy of $10 billion. And so it's huge, and we felt it was important to spell that out.",1
"Okay. And then going back to the upgrades of the installed base, you clearly mentioned that you've pulled forward some demand, which makes sense. But there does seem to be a lengthening of the upgrade cycle, particularly in the U.S. AT&T and Verizon have talked about that. Investors I think perceive that maybe the marginal improvements on the phone might be less currently and could be less going forward. At the same time, I think you just announced that you can get the upgrade program online, which I guess potentially could shorten it. Do you believe that upgrade cycles are currently lengthening and can continue to do so?",1
"What we've seen is that it depends on what you compare it to. If you compare to the iPhone 5s, what we're seeing is the upgrade rate today is slightly higher or that there are more people upgrading, if you will, in a similar time period in terms of rate than the iPhone 5s. But if you compare to iPhone 6, you would clearly arrive at the opposite conclusion. And so I think it depends on people's reference points. And we thought it very important in this call to be very clear and transparent about what we are seeing. And so I think in retrospect, you can look at it and say, well maybe the appropriate measure is more to the iPhone 5s, and I think everybody intuitively thought that the upgrades were accelerated with the iPhone 6. In retrospect, when you look at the periods, they clearly were.",1
"Thanks, Steve. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"Thanks, guys, for fitting me in. I wanted to start with a more general question. I guess. Tim, this one is aimed at you. As you think about where you thought things were going to head last quarter when you reported to us and how it's changed this quarter, obviously this kind of a disappointing demand environment. Can you just help us understand what maybe the top two or three things are that have changed, so as we walk away from this we understand what the differences are and what the direction of change is? And I've got a follow up.",1
"We had great Mac results during the quarter. Revenue grew 14% to a new March quarter record and gained market share thanks to strong demand for our new MacBook Pros. Our Mac business has generated over $25 billion in revenue over the past four quarters. We're investing aggressively in its future, and we are very excited about the innovation we can bring to the platform.",1
"We also updated our most popular sized iPad with a brighter Retina display and best-in-class performance at its most affordable price ever, and customer response to date has been very strong. iPad results were ahead of our expectations, and we believe we gained share during the March quarter in a number of major markets, including the U.S., Japan, and Australia. iPad remains the world's most popular tablet, and it's the primary computing device for millions of customers across the globe.",1
"Building on the momentum from the holiday quarter, Apple Watch sales nearly doubled year over year. Apple Watch is the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world, and we hear wonderful stories from our customers about its impact on their fitness and health.",1
"The partnership with Cisco enables optimized performance of iOS devices over their networks and is generating a large and growing pipeline of sales opportunities across multiple verticals, including healthcare and financial services.",1
"Turning to iPad, we sold 8.9 million units, which was ahead of our expectations despite supply constraints throughout the quarter. We are very pleased to see iPad growth in the U.S. during the March quarter and revenue growth worldwide for our 9.7-inch and larger iPads over the last four quarters. iPad channel inventory was essentially flat from the beginning to the end of the quarter, and we exited just below our five to seven-week target range.",1
"iPad remains very successful in the segments of the tablet market where we compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 81% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in February, 451 Research measured consumer satisfaction rates for iPad that range from 95% for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to 100% for the 12.9-inch version. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, purchase intention for iPad was 69%. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 68% for the June quarter.",1
"All our products continue to be extremely popular and drive more buying transformation in the enterprise market. We set a new enterprise revenue record for the March quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue for the remainder of the year.",1
"Recently, Volkswagen selected iPhone as their corporate standard smartphone, so 620,000 employees around the world have the opportunity to enjoy the best-in-class mobile experience that iPhone offers. And Capital One has reimagined the customer banking experience by empowering their associates with Mac and Apple Watch and over 40 native iOS applications now running on nearly 30,000 iPhones and iPads.",1
"We're also seeing strong momentum with our enterprise partners, who are helping us deliver long-lasting innovation and differentiation for iOS versus competing platforms. The Deloitte partnership is off to a great start, with more than 115 customer opportunities in the pipeline across 15 different industries.",1
"SAP released the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS at the end of March, and over 3 million SAP developers now have an even better means to develop powerful iOS-native apps for the enterprise.",1
"And our partnership with IBM continues to drive greater productivity and innovation, with IBM Mobile First for iOS apps now in more than 3,300 client engagements. And with its Mobile at Scale offering, IBM recently closed an agreement to deploy 11,000 iOS devices at Santander Bank to drive digital transformation.",1
"We're also seeing great response to AirPods, with a 98% customer satisfaction rating based on a recent Creative Strategy survey. Demand for AirPods significantly exceeds supply, and growth in Beats products has also been very strong. In fact, when we combine Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones, our revenue from wearable products in the last four quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company.",1
"Our retail and online stores produced great results, with strong revenue growth in all our geographic segments and 18% growth overall. Visitors to our retail and online stores were up 16% over last year, and we added four new stores during the March quarter. And with the opening of our store in Dubai last week, we're now at 495 stores in 18 countries.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $256.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.8 billion. $239.6 billion of this cash, or 93% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $11 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to $88.5 billion in term debt and $10 billion in commercial paper outstanding.",1
"We returned over $10 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and we spent $4 billion on repurchases of 31.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 17.5 million shares. And we retired 6.3 million shares upon the completion of our ninth accelerated share repurchase program in February. All these activities contributed to a net diluted share count reduction of 66.3 million shares in the quarter. We have now completed $211.2 billion of our $250 billion capital return program, including $151 billion in share repurchases.",1
"As Tim mentioned, today we're announcing an update to our program, which we are extending by four quarters through March of 2019, and increasing in size to a total of $300 billion. Once again, given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, we are allocating the majority of the program expansion to share repurchases. Our board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $175 billion level to $210 billion. We will also continue to net share settle vesting employees' restricted stock units.",1
"In addition, we're raising our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years. As we know, this is very important to many of our investors who value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.57 to $0.63 per share, an increase of 10.5%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2017. With over $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we're proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters we expect to return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12% of our market cap at the current stock price.",1
"We expect to continue to fund our capital return program with current U.S. cash, future U.S. cash generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, investment opportunities, and our financial outlook. We'll also continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of our program.",1
"Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was up 14% year over year and set a new March quarter record. We sold 4.2 million Macs, up 4% over last year, compared to zero growth in the PC market according to IDC's latest forecast. Demand for MacBook Pro was very strong, helping to drive overall portables growth of 10%, twice the growth of the portables market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory.",1
"The App Store established a new all-time revenue record and grew 40% year over year. We continue to see growth in average revenue per paying account as well as the number of paying accounts across our content stores during the quarter. In fact, the quarterly increase in the number of paying accounts was the largest that we've ever experienced. And according to App Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating twice the revenue of Google Play during the March quarter.",1
"Turning to Services, we generated $7 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year over year and our best results ever for a 13-week quarter. We're very happy with the strong level of growth, especially given the tough compare to last year, as the busy week between Christmas and New Year's fell within the March fiscal quarter a year ago but was included in the December fiscal quarter this year. As we said last quarter, our goal is to double the size of our Services business by 2020.",1
"Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong, not only with consumers but also with business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 96% customer satisfaction rating among iPhone 7 owners and 98% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, iPhone customer satisfaction was 95%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone.",1
"We had very solid iPhone growth in four of our five operating segments and experienced especially strong results in Western Europe, the Middle East, and our Rest of Asia-Pacific segment, all areas of the world where iPhone sales were up double digits. iPhone ASP was $655, up from $642 a year ago, thanks to a strong mix of iPhone 7 Plus and in spite of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. We exited the March quarter within our five to seven-week target channel inventory range.",1
"For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 50.8 million iPhones, and we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.2 million units in the quarter, compared to a reduction of about 450,000 a year ago. So our iPhone performance was slightly better than last year on a sell-through basis.",1
"Gross margin was 38.9%, at the high end of our guidance range. That's a sequential increase from 38.5% in the December quarter, which is particularly impressive given the seasonal loss of leverage, sequential foreign exchange headwinds of 100 basis points, and cost pressures on certain commodities. Operating margin was 26.7% of revenue and net income was $11 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.10, an increase of 10% over last year, and cash flow from operations was strong at $12.5 billion.",1
"Revenue for the March quarter was $52.9 billion, and we achieved double-digit growth in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Our growth rates were even higher, over 20% in many other markets, including Brazil, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India, Korea and Thailand.",1
"Now for more details on the March quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.",1
"We have many more ongoing investments in the United States economy, since Apple is a company that could only have been created in America. Through our innovative products and the success of our business, we're incredibly proud to support more than 2 million jobs in all 50 states, and we expect to create even more. Last fiscal year, we spent more than $50 billion in the United States with American suppliers, developers, and partners, and we continue to invest confidently in our future.",1
"Closer to home, we're excited about moving into our new corporate headquarters, Apple Park, our new center for innovation. The main building on Apple Park is designed to house 13,000 employees under one roof in an environment that fosters even greater collaboration among our incredibly talented teams.",1
"I'm very proud to mention that we recently released our 10th annual Environmental Responsibility Report, reflecting our amazing progress. In 2016, 96% of the electricity used at Apple's global facilities came from renewable sources of energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. We're now 100% renewable in 24 countries, including all of Apple's data centers. There's much more work to be done, but we're committed to leaving the world better than we found it.",1
"We're very excited about our upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference taking place in San Jose next month. The conference is significantly oversubscribed, and we'll be welcoming thousands of attendees. We look forward to helping them learn about breakthrough technologies across all four of our software platforms â iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS â that enable developers to create incredible experiences for every aspect of customers' lives and improve the way they manage their homes, cars, health, and more.",1
"As Luca will discuss in a moment, today we're also providing an update to our capital return program. Given our strong confidence in our future, we're increasing the program size by $50 billion, bringing the total to $300 billion, and we're extending the timeframe through March of 2019. We're adding to our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years.",1
"Apple Retail is entering an exciting chapter with new experiences for customers and breathtaking new store designs. With the opening of our newest store in Dubai this past weekend, we now have 495 retail locations worldwide. The new Apple Dubai Mall is a truly international store, with employees who collectively speak 45 languages, and are already welcoming customers from around the world.",1
"We set a new March quarter record for India, where revenue grew by strong double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem, and we're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young, and tech-savvy population, fast-growing economy, and improving 4G network infrastructure.",1
"In Greater China, we were very pleased to see strong double-digit revenue growth from both Mac and Services during the March quarter. We also had great results from our retail stores in mainland China, with total store revenue up 27% over last year and comp store revenue up 7%. These results contributed to our improving performance in Greater China. Through the first two quarters of fiscal 2017, our year-over-year comparisons improved significantly over the last two quarters of fiscal 2016. First half revenue was down 13% year over year, about a third of which was attributable to FX. That's in contrast to a 32% revenue decline in the second half of last year. Our March quarter results were in line with our expectations, and similar to the year-over-year performance we experienced in the December quarter. We continue to be very enthusiastic about our opportunity in China.",1
"One maybe quick follow up, Tim, in terms of the base of iPhones that have upgraded. I think you provided a number last quarter on that. Is there any update to that metric?",1
"Thereâs a foreign exchange element, and I mentioned before the negative impact on a sequential basis about 40 basis points. And also, weâre launching the Apple Watch. Apple Watch is not only a new product, but itâs a brand new category with a lot of new features, a lot of new, innovative technologies. And Apple Watch margins will be lower than company average.",1
"And Gene, let me take your question on margins. Iâll talk about Q3, because you know, this is the period that we provide guidance for. And we guided to 38.5% to 39.5%, which is slightly down versus our performance in Q2. And this is driven by a number of things. First of all, itâs the loss of leverage from the sequential decline in revenue. This is typical of our seasonality.",1
"Thank you Tim and good afternoon everyone. As Tim said revenue for the March quarter was $45.6 billion, up $2 billion or 5% from a year ago and above our guidance range. Sales in each of our major product categories were at the high end of our expectations or better and the vast majority of the revenue upside came from strong sales of iPhone.",1
We very much appreciate all of the input that so many of our shareholders have provided us on how the best to deploy our cash. Weâve continued to seek investor input going forward and weâll update you on our conclusions around this time each year.,1
"This regular process allows us to continually evaluate return of capital in light of the most current information available and it enables us to be thoughtful about the size, mix and pace of the program. We continue to be in the fortunate position of being able to return significant capital to shareholders. We started doing so two years ago when we announced our first program of $45 billion and we more than doubled the program last April to $100 billion.",1
"Today, we are announcing that we are increasing the size of our program once again with an addition of over $30 billion for a total program size of over $130 billion. The size and pace of our program is unprecedented and we still expect to complete it by December of 2015 as we announced last year.",1
We think very deliberately about how much and in which way to return cash to our shareholders. We decided to continue to allocate the vast majority of the incremental capital return to share repurchases because we believe our current stock price does not reflect the full value of the company. The size of the share back increases the signal of the Board and the management teamâs strong confidence in the future of Apple.,1
We also understand the importance of the dividend to many of our investors and we are increasing it for the second time in less than two years. We believe this is a meaningful increase for those shareholders who value income and we are planning for annual dividend increases going forward.,1
"Now, I would like to turn the call over to Luca for the details of our quarterly results as well as more information about our capital return program.",1
"Gross margin was 39.3%, also above our guidance range and operating margin was $15.6 billion, representing 29.8% of revenue. Net income was $10.2 billion translating to diluted earnings per share of $11.62.",1
"Weâll continue to innovate by investing in research and development and capitalizing on our strengths in hardware, software and services. Weâll keep investing in our supply chains promote scale and efficiencies, expanding our global presence by building retail stores, investing in marketing and distribution and extending our reach into new markets.",1
"For details by product, Iâd like to start with iPhone. We sold 43.7 million iPhones which was a March quarter record. Thatâs an increase of 6.3 million iPhones over last year that represents 17% growth. The addition of China Mobile coupled with great response to our more affordably priced iPhone 4S led to an all time quarterly record for iPhone sales in Greater China. We look forward to broadening our relationship with China Mobile as they expand points of sale and continue to build out their 4G network.",1
"In Japan, iPhone sales were up over 50% year-over-year resulting in significant market share gains, as Tim mentioned weâll try strong growth and share gains in many other major developed markets based on IDCs latest estimates for the March quarter.",1
"iPhone also continued to perform exceptionally well in many developing markets. In Greater China, Brazil, Indonesia, Poland and Turkey. iPhone sales grew by strong double-digits year-over-year, and in India and Vietnam sales more than doubled.",1
"We exited the quarter with 15.4 million total iPhones in channel inventory, which represents a sequential increase of about 100,000 from the December quarter and left us within our target range of four to six weeks.",1
"In the enterprise market progressive organizations are leading the charge to replace legacy devices and systems, and are using iPhone and iOS to drive innovation at their companies. Deutsche Bank has nearly 20,000 iPhones running on its network and has created 40 internal apps that extend the capabilities of its mobile workforce.",1
"Siemens have 30,000 iPhones on its network and has deployed over 50 internal apps for field service teams, sales associates and corporate executives for solution that are only possible with iOS and iPhone. We are really happy with the continued growth and strength of the Apple ecosystem.",1
"We are expanding Appleâs products and services into new categories and we are not going to under invest in this business. We are also investing through acquisitions and weâve acquired 24 companies in the past 18 months. To invest organically and to make acquisition strategically, we need to maintain financial flexibility. With this framework in mind, Appleâs Board and management team, will do capital allocation regularly and we solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders.",1
"In addition to our quarterly results, we are also announcing an update to our capital return program today, and Iâd like to share a few thoughts about our guiding principles for capital allocation and our conclusion on the changes we are making for this year. Apple has created tremendous value for shareholders by developing great products that enrich peopleâs lives and that will always be our top priority and driving force.",1
"Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, maâam.",1
"iTunes software and services revenue continue to grow at a double-digit rate, thanks to an incredible ecosystem and our very large, loyal and engaged customer base. With its strong momentum in growing profitability, iTunes is a very important driver of our business not only here in the United States, but around the world. We now have an almost 800 million iTunes accounts, most of these with credit cards. This is a staggering number.",1
"Please note that some of the information youâll hear during our discussion today will consists of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, future products and capital allocation plans.",1
"Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Appleâs Form 10-K for 2013, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. We have a lot to share with you over the next hour, and Iâd like to start right away with the very strong results weâre reporting for the March quarter.",1
"We generated $45.6 billion in revenue, which was ahead of our expectations and represents a new March quarter record, and is our strongest non-holiday quarter ever. Our underlying business performance was even stronger than our reported results imply. When you take into account changes in channel inventory this year versus last year and foreign exchange had wins that we faced in several of our international markets. Setting foreign exchange and inventory changes aside, our underlying growth rate would have been close to double digits.",1
"These strong revenue results combined with our best gross margin percentage since September of 2012 resulted in earnings per share growth of 15%, which is our highest earnings growth rate in the last six quarters. iPhone was key in driving our stronger-than-expected results. We sold almost 44 million iPhones, setting a new March quarter record. These stronger results were broad-based both from a product point of view with demand for each of our three iPhone stronger than its predecessor and from a geographic standpoint.",1
"We gained smartphone share in many developed and emerging markets including the U.S., the UK, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Vietnam and Greater China, just to mention a few. In fact, we established a new all-time record for total iPhone sales in the BRIC countries.",1
We continue to gain share in the personal computer market as well. We defied industry trends again by growing while the market contracted. Our bold decision to make OS X free has resulted in the largest ever percentage of the Mac installed base running on the latest version of the operating system just months after its release.,1
"As always, Iâd like to thank our talented employees who make these results possible through their creativity and passion they bring to their work everyday. And Iâd like to thank our hundreds of millions of customers for their loyalty and enthusiasm and for continually inspiring us to surprise and delight them.",1
"iPad sales came in at the high end of our expectations, but we realized they were below analyst estimates, and I would like to proactively address, why we think there was a difference. We believe almost all of the difference can be explained by two factors. First, in the March quarter last year, we significantly increased iPad channel inventory, while this year we significantly reduced it. Luca will go into more detail about this later.",1
"Second, we ended the December quarter last year with a substantial backlog with iPad mini that was subsequently shipped in the March quarter, whereas we ended the December quarter this year near supply demand balance. We continue to believe that the tablet market will surpass the PC market in size within the next few years and we believe that Apple will be a major beneficiary of this trend.",1
"When we look at our company performance on a geographic basis, weâre especially proud of our very strong results in Greater China, where we established an all time quarterly revenue record of almost $10 billion including the results from our retail stores. And in Japan, where revenue was up 26% in spite of the foreign exchange headwinds and where our smartphone market share reached an incredible 55%.",1
"We are continuing to invest in our retail stores and since our last call, we had opened our first stores in Brazil and Turkey and we now have retail stores in 15 countries around the world. Iâm looking forward to welcoming our new retail and online leader, Angela Ahrendts, who will be joining Appleâs Executive Team next week. Stepping back, we are now just passed the halfway mark for fiscal 2014.",1
"Our strong March quarter results bring us to total revenues of over $103 billion for the first six months of the year and earnings per share growth close to double-digits. We estimate that over the last six months, weâve added over $60 million new registered users of our four product categories. Additionally, over two-thirdâs of people registering an iPad in the last six months, were new to iPad, while over half of the people registering iPhones were new to iPhone.",1
"It is wonderful to add tens of millions of first time Apple product users, especially considering the strong halo effect, weâve seen over and over again in our history. Customers who have a great experience with their first Apple products, often become loyal and happy owners of the multiple Apple products overtime.",1
"Total revenue from iTunes software and services was $4.6 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year at an all time quarterly record. Our iTunes stores generated record billings of $5.2 billion in the March quarter, up 24% year-over-year driven by very strong growth in App Store sales. These iTunes billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of over $2.6 billion, up 9% from the year ago quarter, and also a new all-time record.",1
"Software and services revenue was over $1.9 billion, up 14% from a year ago. App Store momentum is incredibly strong as cumulative app downloads at 70 billion, 87% of iOS devices are now running iOS 7 and our highly engaged users are a great audience for developers.",1
"According to App Annie, the App Store generated 85% more global revenue than Google Play in the March quarter despite the differences in unit market share between iOS and Android devices.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Weâd like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up please. Operator, may we have the first question.",1
We expect OpEx to be between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion. We are continuing to invest heavily in R&D for current revenue generating categories as well as future products and services. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.1%.,1
"And now, Iâd like to turn it back to Tim.",1
"Thanks Luca. In addition to the changes to our capital return program today. We are also announcing a seven-for-one split of Apple common stock which will occur in June of this year. We are taking this action to make Apple stock more accessible to a larger number of investors. Each shareholder of record at the close of business on June the 2nd, 2014 will receive six additional shares for every outstanding share held on the record day and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on June the 9th, 2014.",1
"Finally, before we start the Q&A, I would like to take a minute to talk about my dear friend and colleague Peter Oppenheimer. As you know, Peter will be transitioning from the CFO role in June. Peter has been Appleâs CFO for 10 years and the list of his accomplishments is immense. Apple is now more than 20 times the size it was when Peter became our CFO and his expertise, leadership and incredibly hard work had been instrumental to the companyâs success. Iâd like to thank him very publicly for his contributions to Apple, from the very bottom of my heart and wish him all the best in his approaching retirement at the end of September.",1
"And Iâd also like to recognize him that he has never missed guidance in the 10 years as CFO which must be an all-time record for CFOs. Weâre really happy and fortunate to have someone with Lucaâs talent on Board to replace Peter. He has over 25 years of experience, building and leading finance teams in global companies and has an exceptionally broad international background, which you might be able to detect from his accent. Heâs been managing most of Appleâs financial functions since coming on Board last year and has done an outstanding job. Iâm looking forward to working with Luca even closer as Appleâs next CFO.",1
"With that, Iâd like to open the call for questions.",1
"Thanks. Congrats on the great quarter. Tim, if I heard you right that $800 million account is a staggering jump from the last time you reported that number and yet iTunes, software and services growth decelerated again this quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about your view on the importance of better monetizing the installed base in the future? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"Now, Iâd like to talk about the Mac. We saw 4.1 million Macs compared to just under 4 million in the year ago quarter. Thanks to strong performance from MacBook Pro and MacBook Air and Macs have now gained global market share for 31 of the last 32 quarters. Response to Mavericks has been great, and we are very proud of the fact that so many of our Mac customers are taking advantage of the most advanced and secured experience possible. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our four to five week target range.",1
"Keep in mind, in that category thereâs several things, not just the App Store kind of revenues and so if you looked at App Store only, it would look a little different than what youâre seeing. But in terms of your question about monetization, I do believe that we can monetize more than we owe from a services point of view in existing areas and in new areas. And Iâm particularly encouraged that when I look at the App Store and how itâs doing the strength was broad based. And in fact in China the growth was in the triple digits.",1
"Okay. And then question the around iPhone ASPs, just looking at the trend iPhone 5s, demand has surprised to the upside over this cycle. Does that give you any confidence that Apple could actually charge more for highly innovative products in the future or does the strategy remain to add innovation at the same price as previous versions of a product?",1
We price things that we think â are priced in such a way that we think itâs a fair price for the value that weâre delivering and we make those on each thing as it gets closer time to come to market.,1
"Okay. Thank you. Peter, much luck to you.",1
From Goldman Sachs weâll hear from Bill Shope.,1
"Okay, great. Thanks. Can you walk through the key drivers of the June quarter gross margin guidance off of what was admittedly very sharp upside for the March quarter.",1
"Now, as we move ahead into the June quarter, Iâd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $36 billion and $38 billion compared to $35.3 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margins to be between 37% and 38%.",1
We have also prepared ourselves to access the commercial paper market given the substantial short term liquidity and flexibility that this channel can provide.,1
"We continue to advocate for comprehensive corporate tax reform and streamlining the tax code which we believe would be of great benefit to the U.S. economy. To execute our updated capital return program in a tax efficient manner and leverage our very strong balance sheet, we intend to access the debt markets again. We plan to be active in both the domestic and international bond markets during 2014 for an amount of term debt financing similar to what we issued in 2015, with a break down between markets currencies and tenures to be determined over the course of the year and subject to prevailing conditions in each market.",1
"All our capital return activities must be funded by domestic cash which as I mentioned was about $18 billion as we exited the March quarter, and down from $39 billion in the quarter that we paid our first dividend. We would maintain sufficient domestic liquidity to grow the business and execute capital expenditures and acquisitions. Thanks to Appleâs strong growth in international expansion in recent years. We have built substantial offshore cash balances to repatriate our fall in cash on the current U.S. tax law, we will incur significant cash tax consequences and we donât believe this would be in the best interest of our shareholders.",1
"Second, our Board has declared a dividend of $3.29 per common share payable on May 15, 2014 to shareholders of record as of May 12, 2014. That represents an increase of about 8% in our quarterly dividend. We understand the importance of dividend increases to many of our investors, and weâre increasing the dividend for the second time in less than two years. We are planning for continued annual increases and weâre very proud that Apple is one of the largest dividend payers in the world, with annual payments of $11 billion.",1
"Today weâve taken additional steps that will increase the overall size of the program from $100 billion to over $130 billion within the same timeframe of December 2015 as before. There are two elements to the expansion of the program. First, weâre increasing the size of our share repurchase authorization from $60 billion to $90 billion. We are very confident in Appleâs future, and we believe our current stock price does not reflect the full value of the Company. Thatâs why the vast majority of our capital program continues to be allocated to share repurchases. We will also continue to net-share-settle, restricted stock units and expect to utilize about $1 billion of cash annually for that purpose.",1
"We have acted aggressively and opportunistically and have delivered on our intention to return capital to shareholders at a fast pace. Including dividends and net-share-settlements, weâve taken action on $66 billion of total $100 billion program announced last year.",1
"I would like now to go into more detail about the expansion of our capital return program that weâre announcing today. Let me start by summarizing the progress that weâve made on the program we updated a year ago. By the end of March 2014, weâve already taken action of $46 billion of the current $60 billion share repurchase authorization, over 75% of the program with seven quarters remaining to its completion.",1
"Second, we paid $2.7 billion in dividends in February. And finally, we spent $6 billion on open market purchases of 11.4 million shares throughout the March quarter. At the end of March, we also settled our second ASR program, which was launched in April of last year, resulting in the retirement of an additional 1.1 million shares.",1
"In total, we executed almost $21 billion worth of capital return activities during the March quarter. First, we launched our third accelerated share repurchase program in late January through which we will acquire an additional $12 billion of Apple stock. We received an initial delivery of 19.2 million shares under this ASR and we received a balance of shares due when the program concludes by December of this year.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $150.6 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decline of $8.3 billion. Our domestic cash was $18.4 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential decline of $16 billion and $132.2 billion or 88% of our total cash was offshore. Cash flow from operations was very strong at $13.5 billion for the quarter.",1
"The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is on its way to deploying iPads to 11,000 providers to transform the way doctors and patients interact. As part of this initiative, a suite of applications is being developed to allow quick access to real-time secure medical information. In education, according to the latest data published by IDC, iPad has over 95% share of the U.S. education tablet market as teachers and students increasingly benefit from the growing range of engaging iBooks, textbooks and solutions that are helping to transform the education experience.",1
"Eli Lilly has deployed over 20,000 iPads and 50 internal apps as part of a laptop replacement program that dramatically increased the productivity and capabilities of its employees.",1
"In a February survey, ChangeWave measured a 98% customer satisfaction rate for both iPad Air and iPad Mini with Retina display. And also found that among people planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days two-thirds plan to buy an iPad. iPad continues to allow companies around the world to reimagine the way they use technology to drive efficiency and improve employee satisfaction. Thousands of iPads are used at FedEx everyday. In an industry where efficiency is critical FedEx pilots and maintenance crews around the world use iPad to transform operational processes and save the company millions of dollars.",1
"iPad continues to lead all other tablets by far in terms of user engagement, size of ecosystem, customer satisfaction and e-commerce. A recent study by Chitika Insights found that iPad users in North America generate almost four times the web traffic of all Android tablet users combined.",1
"Last year we sold over 19.4 million iPads into our channels and sold through 18 million and therefore increased channel inventory by 1.4 million units. As a result, the year-over-year sell through decline was only 3% compared to the sell in decline of 16%. We exit the March quarter with 5.1 million units of iPad channel inventory, which left us within our target range of four to six weeks.",1
"Turning to iPad, we saw 16.4 million units. As Tim explained earlier, our iPad results and the comparison to the March quarter last year were heavily influenced by channel inventory changes. Specifically, this year we saw 16.4 million iPads into our channels and sold through almost 17.5 million reducing our channel inventory by 1.1 million units.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first today are Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and Vice President and Corporate Controller, Luca Maestri, and they will be joined by CFO, Peter Oppenheimer for the Q&A session with the analysts.",1
"Thanks, Mark. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone, and the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. Please enter confirmation code 2954408. And these replays will be available by approximately 6.00 PM today Pacific Time. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896 and financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570, and Iâm at 408-974-5420. And thanks again for joining us.",1
"And so I think things look very, very good. Weâre also pleased, in addition to the switcher number, that weâre doing fairly well with first time buyers, which is also a key metric for us. And so itâs tough to find something in the numbers not to like.",1
"So, Toni, let me try to address, you mentioned both smartphones and tablets and so let me try to address both of those. First let me start with the tablet side, the numbers that weâve seen from IDC would indicate that they believe the market in March declined by 30% from December, December being obviously seasonally high quarter with a holiday. As you can see from our numbers, we declined 15%. And so if that holds, we did much better than the market and had a very nice pick up in market share.",1
"Yeah. Toni, itâs Peter, Iâll take your first two. Weâre very pleased with the progress that weâre making on getting down cost curves and this will help to partially offset the loss of leverage and the different product mix that we expect to see in the June quarter and we have factored these cost improvements into the guidance weâre providing for the quarter. The iPhone ASPs were down sequentially about $28 as you noted. And this was driven primarily by mix. The largest factors were an increase in the iPhone 4 mix, which resulted from or making the iPhone 4 more affordable in many markets. And also mix within the iPhone 5 as it was in its second full quarter.",1
"And its impact on margins, how do we think about relative margins for 4 relative to 5 on balance?",1
"Toni, we donât provide margins by product or within product line. But I talked about two factors that were impacting gross margin on a sequential basis. The first is leveraging, thatâs largest of the two on the lower sequential revenue. But we also expect to see a different product mix and thatâs primarily related to iPhone.",1
Okay. And thenâ¦,1
"Toni, just one other point on that is, as you get further, we see this on most of our product line, as you get further from a previous product launch, there is a general within a line, a general lower mix than where it starts. And so youâd expect, all things being equal, youâd expect to see that on most of our products.",1
"Okay. Thank you. Tim, I wanted to follow-up with you on a statement you made in a previous response. You talked earlier about how you are excited about the large addressable markets that you have particularly, the smartphone and tablet marketplaces. And you talked about how strongly and confidently, you feel about competitive advantages in your products and ecosystems. If I step back and look at the data for this quarter on the phone side, if I adjust for inventory, the iPhone was up very low to mid single digits. I think most third-party market data would say that the smartphone market probably grew about 30%. And if I look broadly incorporating your guidance for next quarter and thinking about fiscal Q1, it appears very unlikely that Apple will grow at that market rate of 30% or more. So I am wondering if you could comment on a) whether that [extent of the] [ph] loss in market share is something that is â Apple has focused on or cares about as a principle financial objective? And if so, why do you think there is this disconnect between the very attractive products that you are offering and the market data that I just cited?",1
"And, obviously, on iPad, we continue to have an ecosystem story that is unparalleled, we have 350,000 apps that are optimized for iPad versus a few hundred for our competition and the overall experience in the fit and finish of the product, I think, we agree is substantially better than the options there.",1
"Thanks, Steve. Can we have next question please?",1
"On the phone side, the numbers that you talked about, the sell-in comparisons year-over âyear, you really have to convert that to sell-through to look at the underlying demand. And as Iâve gone through before, we did grow channel inventory in the year ago quarter because we were catching up on the roll out of the iPhone 4S, in fact, we grew by 2.6 million. And so you have to factor in to get at the real sell-through.",1
"However, I take your point if the market did grow by 30%, we still, after that normalization, we grew less than that. And so I think the question or the â this point is not lost and we do want to grow faster. We donât view it, however, as the only measure of our health. The things that are very important to us in addition to market share and unit volumes include things like customer stat, which were the highest by far winning J.D. Powerâs nine times consecutively and the customer loyalty and repurchase rates, which were the highest by far the 95% according to Kantar. And the ecosystem commerce, which attracts developers is incredible, Canalys says that we have 74%, so basically $3 out of $4 that are spent on apps are spent in our ecosystem.",1
"And if you then looked at usage statistics, they are staggering at the usage of iOS versus other operating systems. And so market shares are important and unit volumes are important, but these other things for us are extremely important, because we are all about customer experience and enriching lives.",1
"Now, that said, we see an enormous number of first time smartphone buyers coming to market, particularly, in certain countries around the world. And so what weâve done with that is and we started last quarter is weâve made the iPhone 4 even more affordable and which has made it more attractive to first time buyers and we caught up on the â our supply - demand towards the late in the quarter last quarter and we are continuing to do that in other markets. And we believe that the phone or the price point that we are offering is an incredible value for people, that allows them to get into the ecosystem with a really, really, phenomenal product.",1
"Thank you, Tony. The next question please.",1
From Barclays weâll go to Ben Reitzes.,1
"Yes, thank you. I wanted to revisit the gross margin question. and specifically, I was hoping you could comment on whether you feel youâre experiencing that the normal kinds of experience curves or declining cost curves that you do in typical product ramps. And whether you could comment on the sequential decline in iPhone ASPs, which were down nearly $30 sequentially, I presume that reflects a mix of 4 and 4S relative to the 5. But perhaps, you can confirm that in what its impact might have on gross margins and how we should think about that? and I have a follow-up please.",1
"I have incredible confidence. We exited the March quarter with no shortages while achieving inventory turns of over 90, which is still to this day is staggering for our industry. The December quarter that youâre referring to was the largest quarter ever in the history of Apple and the technology industry as a whole. And as you know, it included for us a number of new products and unprecedented number and of new product ramps. The reality is the work we do to produce truly innovative products is very hard and there has always been challenges that Iâm sure weâll face some in the future. However, I would assure you that we are working very closely with our manufacturing partners to execute what we feel is a very exciting roadmap.",1
"And Mark this is Peter. I will add that, we are now paying very happily our developers more than $1 billion every quarter.",1
"China has a unusually large number of potential first-time smartphone buyers, and thatâs not lost on us. Weâve seen a significant interest in iPhone 4 there and have recently made it even more affordable to make it even more attractive to those first-time buyers. and so weâre hopeful that will help iPhone sales in the future.",1
"Okay. Thank you, and Tim, question for you on China. Growth did slow in that market to single digits this quarter, curious of your perspective as to whether Apple is hitting a wall given you donât have the largest carrier formally selling your products? And just any thoughts around the stickiness of customers in China given you donât have an iTunes store there, and data shows that they download fewer apps than in developed countries? Thanks.",1
"Katy, thanks for the question. We actually had our best quarter ever in Greater China. So it was a record for us. The revenue came in at $8.8 billion. That includes our retail stores that are in that region that is up 11% year on year, again that includes the retail stores that are in that region, which is the same as Apple is growing.",1
"The highlights for the quarter in China were that iPads grew 138% year-on-year, and we set new records for sell-through both for iPhone and iPad during the quarter. There were some significant year-over-year timing differences with regard to channel inventory relative to iPhone that affected the compares year-over-year.",1
"In particular, in the year-ago quarter, we increased iPhone channel inventories globally by $2.6 billion, as you probably recall, $1.6 billion of $2.6 billion occurred in Greater China to support the launches that were in the March quarter of last year. And so, if you look at revenue on a sell-through basis, our Greater China revenue was actually up approximately 18%. And so itâs a bit better than it first looked.",1
"As I said, in the year-ago quarter, we launched the iPhone 4S with China Unicom in January and we launched China Telecom in March; this year, the iPhone 5 launched in December. and so itâs a very different set of dynamics on a year-on-year basis.",1
"Going forward, we still see a significant opportunity in China, itâs a great market. We have 11 stores there. we expect to double those in less than two years. We have added about 8,000 iPhone point-of-sales in the indirect channel to about 19,000 today and we obviously have a plan to add more and further grow our distribution, December is obviously too low currently. Weâre also innovating in our online, with our online store there in adding different functionality to the store.",1
"Okay, thanks. Tim, you mentioned several factors that were compressing growth in gross margins in recent quarters in this year. but can you comment a bit more on the competitive landscape in 2013 versus 2012? how has it surprised you, and what do you think the company needs to do to reinvigorate your share gains across your key product categories?",1
"Okay. And then could you talk a bit about the supply chain, there has been some concern with some of the product limitations late last year, I mean itâs got to be getting so huge relatively to what you used to run. But whatâs your confidence level in the supply chain particularly as youâre potentially moving to new types of vendors over time as the units continue to increase?",1
"Bill, I think the smartphone market has always been competitive. The names have been changed. the names of competitors have changed. In the beginning, RIM was sort of the very strongest player, because the smartphone as you know really got going into the enterprise area. And of course, today, our tough competitor from a hardware point of view would be Samsung and married to Google on the operating system side.",1
"They are obviously tough competitors, but we feel that we have the best products by far. And we are continuing to invest in innovative products and feel really, really confident about our product pipeline in both hardware, software and also our services. We have the best ecosystem by far, and weâre just going to keep augmenting it, and making it better and better. and that shows up in both our royalty ratings and our customer stat and I feel very good about our competitive position.",1
One more question if I may. Can you comment on how youâre thinking about the pace of your buyback program and what factors are you going to consider to determine purchase timing over the next few years?,1
"Sure, Bill, itâs Peter, Iâll take that. Weâre going to begin buying shares under the authorization beginning this month. And we expect to utilize the remaining $58 billion under the authorization by the end of calendar year 2015, which spans 32 months from now. We expect to use accelerated share repurchase programs and to buy in the open market.",1
"Thank you very much. Tim, you alluded to fall announcements of products, is that indicating that there may not be substantial new products until literally fall late September, which means the September quarter could look a lot like the June quarter, is that part of what are implying or were you just being more general?",1
"I donât want to be more specific, but Iâm just saying weâve got some really great stuff coming in the fall and across all of 2014.",1
"Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Tim and Peter, can you comment on gross margin beyond next quarter maybe what does it say about long-term gross margins if 36 to 37 is the margin that you are calling for when your highest margin product, letâs hope is that a trough for the year and I think you are implying that when you say all these new products are coming in the fall.",1
So is there an implied margin philosophy here with this 2Q guide that 36 is as low as you wanted to get and then maybe it gets better from there or is there nothing that we should imply in terms of how the company views gross margins?,1
"Ben, itâs Peter. Iâll start on that one. Itâs been our long-term practice, weâre not providing specific gross margin guidance beyond the June quarter. We donât do this, because there are many factors that can influence gross margins and a specific quarter and cause them to vary widely over time, including product cycles, commodity markets, product mix, and currencies.",1
"That said, I donât think this market is a dead market or bad market by any means. I think it has a lot of life to it. We are going to continue to innovate in it. We believe that if anything the huge growth in tablets may wind up benefiting the Mac, because it pushes people to think about the product theyâre buying in a different manner and people maybe even more willing to buy a Mac where today than may be buying a PC. And so weâre going to continue making the best personal computers. our strategy is not changing. And we feel really good about it. We delivered some incredible innovation last year with Retina display with the MacBook Pro, an incredible thin and light package and weâve got some more great stuff plan. So this is an area weâre continuing to invest in.",1
"Okay. Let met ask you this way in terms of just the payment market specifically, I mean, do you feel that that market is well addressed today with the offerings out there?",1
"I think itâs in its infancy, Gene. I think itâs just getting started and just out of the starting block.",1
"Thanks, Gene. Can we have the next question please?",1
"From Cross Research, weâll go to Shannon Cross",1
"Thank you very much. Tim, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about what youâre thinking about within the Mac market and PC market because obviously you outperformed substantially the competition but weâre still down about 2%. So I am curious as to whether or not you think elasticity of demand with lower prices or what you are hearing from your customers in terms of their reluctance to buy a new Mac and then also how youâre thinking about the cannibalization potential thatâs coming out of the iPad?",1
"I think the, Shannon, I think the reason that we were down last quarter, we were down 2% as you had mentioned. The market for PCs are incredibly weak. IDC said that the market for the March quarter was down 14% year-on-year, which is the largest decline that I remember from being in this industry for a long time. At the same time, we sold almost 20 million iPads and itâs certainly true that some of those iPads cannibalized some Macs. I personally donât think it was a huge number, but do I think itâs some, and I think probably the larger thing at least for the, maybe not so much on the Macs side, but on the PC side, itâs cheaper, probably extending their upgrade cycles.",1
"Okay. And just a follow-up question with regard to the tablet market. Weâve met with some of your competitors recently and theyâre starting to talk about wins in the enterprise, and touting the benefits of Microsoft and some of the other OSâs that are out there in terms of security and interoperability in some of the enterprise companies. So Iâm curious what youâve heard from your customers, have you seen much displacement and what are sort of the discussions that you have with enterprise customers with regard to iPads and fitting into their systems? Thanks.",1
"So while we donât want to make a forecast beyond June, let me tell you how we think about gross margin and hopefully this will help. We are managing the business for the long-term and are willing to trade off short-term profit where we see long-term potential. The iPod is a great example of this. When we launched it in 2001, its margins were significantly below the margins of Apple at that time.",1
"We seem to be doing really well and Peter had referenced earlier, the Good Technologyâs data that says that iOS accounted for 77% of all their activations by their corporate customers. Now that would not include BlackBerry, but it would include all the other guys. and so we seem to be doing really well and honestly, I donât see the recent announcements changing that at all. Iâve seen more and more people developing more and more custom apps for their businesses on iOS to be used on iPad and weâre very, very bullish on it. As a matter of fact, just to quote you some numbers, iPad now is being used in 95% of the Fortune 500 and whatâs even more impressive probably is on the global 500 companies, weâre now in 89%.",1
Weâll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.,1
"Thank you. Tim, earlier you talked about how the December quarter had a very big and broad product refresh, were there any learning points from that experience in terms of maybe itâs better to stage or kind of stagger out launches over multi-quarters versus one quarter. How should we think about that going forward?",1
"Itâs a good question. I donât spend a lot of time looking back except to learn from it, and if we could run it over frankly, I would have announced the iMac after the turn of the year, because we felt our customers had to wait too long for that specific product; or the iPad mini was in shortage in the December quarter I would not have done that differently, because we were able to get the iPad mini out to many millions of customers who really wanted that product for their holiday. And so, yes, we did do a lot, our teams fortunately can do a lot, but in retrospect that one, yeah, I sort of wish it were after the turn of the year, because our customers would not have had to wait as long as they did.",1
"Okay. And then my follow-up question is back to the ecosystem. Are there other metrics or milepost you can share with us, you acknowledged earlier that the growth of revenue at Apple have slowed for some of your key products. But how about the ecosystem in terms of usage rates, are you seeing slowing there or are you actually seeing the opposite where thereâs maybe acceleration within each user?",1
"We see incredible usage in every study that we see. These arenât just done by us, as a matter of fact the vast majority of them come from other people. The usage of iOS devices are staggering compared to others. Itâs a phenomenal difference. And I think that shows the strength of the ecosystem.",1
"And I would just add to that, because we are not fragmented like our competition, we can update an iOS with a major release and a substantial percentage of our customers will update to the â to our latest offer. Weâve made that very elegant and very easy. Also because the usage for iOS is so much higher, when we integrate things well, people use them a lot more and so just those concepts by itself are huge advantages from a customer experience point of view and from a more of the metrics that youâre thinking about point of view.",1
"Well, nothing specific, Gene, but we are very fortunate to have the largest and broadest ecosystem in the world. We have App Stores in 155 countries and iTunes Stores in over 110 countries. We have hundreds of millions of users. weâve just crossed a $16 billion run rate on the iTunes Stores in terms of billings, and just achieved for the first time $4 billion in revenue for our services. So weâre really thrilled with what weâve just reported this quarter, but we see opportunity that weâre going to invest in tremendously to delight our customers and continue to grow our business in those areas.",1
"Okay. And Peter, you mentioned new services in that you can kind of build and kind of improve on existing services, and I guess, beyond just the natural evolution of maybe Maps and iCloud, are there any other kind of key assets that you guys have which you can leverage in the new services?",1
"Well, I didnât announce the specific timeframe, butâ¦",1
And that would presumably be kind of in the next year?,1
"I did, Gene. I said that one of our areas for growth are potential new categories, and weâre very excited about those.",1
"Hey, good afternoon. Tim, I just wanted to confirm, did you mention in your prepared remarks that something about new product categories or did I not hear you correctly?",1
Weâll go to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.,1
"Yes, got it.",1
Does that answer?,1
Got it.,1
"Our competitors had made some significant trade-offs in many of these areas in order to ship a larger display, we would not ship a larger display iPhone while these trade-offs exist.",1
"Yeah Ben, thatâs a good question. My view continues to be that iPhone 5 has the absolute best display in the industry. And we always strive to create the very best display for our customers. And some customers value large screen size, others value also other factors such as resolution, color quality, white balance, brightness, reflectivity, screen longevity, power consumption, portability, compatibility with apps and many things.",1
"All right, thanks. And Tim, my follow-up just for you, just maybe asking you this every quarter in different ways. But I just wanted to get your reaction to what you thought of the 5-inch phone market at this time versus three months ago? And if anything has changed in your view as to that market and its place in the smartphone world versus your 4-inch product? And thatâs it from me.",1
"And weâre managing Apple with a very long-term horizon. Some of our revenues and profits occur after we ship our products. We were thrilled to exceed this quarter $4 billion in revenue for our services for the first time. And as Tim mentioned, we will augment our very strong ecosystem with new services and make the current ones even, even better. So we remain very confident in our strategy and we will use our world-class skills in engineering and operations to manage our business well in the future.",1
"We believe deeply that there are people in every part of the world that want great products. Looking back over the last several years, weâve made very good business decisions balancing units, revenues, and the bottom line. We think about all three and as I said, weâre willing to make short-term trade-offs and profits, where we see long-term potential.",1
"Four years later, the iPod and the iTunes Music Store comprised half of Appleâs revenues and inspired us to build the iPhone. The iPad mini is another great example. We have priced it aggressively and its margins are significantly below the corporate average. However, we believe deeply in the long-term potential of the tablet market and think that weâve made a great strategic decision. Weâll only make great products and this precludes us from making cheap products that donât deliver a great experience.",1
"Sure. Bill, Iâll take that. So March quarter was very good as you said. There were three seasons for it. We had obviously better volume as youâve seen from our revenue results. We had better cost than anticipated, and we had some favorable mix of both products and services. As we get into Q3, obviously as youâve seen from our revenue guidance we are expecting some loss of leverage, which would come from the sequential decline in revenue. Itâs about 19% at the midpoint of the range, and weâre also expecting less favorable mix. This is something very typical that happens to us as we move farther away from the quarter when we launched the new products. To offset that, it's only going to be a partial offset. We will have some cost improvements.",1
"Then looking at the iPhone upside for the March quarter, obviously, it looks like China was a key driver here, but within the U.S., did you see as much pressure from the changes in U.S. carrier upgrade policy that you had discussed last quarter, and was demand I guess just strong enough to completely counter that? And then is this headwind behind us now, and potentially a tailwind in the U.S. as we head into the June quarter?",1
"We saw some pressure in the quarter because of the stricter enforcement of upgrade policies. So this was primarily in the U.S. as I mentioned last time. But if you really look at iPhone, the strength of iPhone was very broad-based and as I've mentioned, we gained share in a whole host of markets, from developing markets like the U.S., U.K., France, Germany to more of the emerging markets like China, Vietnam, and had the largest total sales of iPhone in the BRIC countries that we've ever seen in our history. And so we feel very good about that the strength was broad-based.",1
"The vast majority of the app opportunities that have been identified as part of the Apple and IBM partnership are specifically for iPad. In addition to IBM, we working closely with more than two dozen other leading business software and solution providers including Box, Docusign, Microstrategy, Revel, and ServiceMax to bring a broad range of innovative mobile solutions to more customers on iPad.",1
"The strong mix of iPhone 6 and 6 plus combined with the popularity of higher capacity offerings led to iPhone ASPs of $659, an increase of $62 year over year, despite the very significant foreign exchange headwinds I already mentioned.",1
"We increased iPhone channel inventory by 1 million units during the quarter, which allowed us to get into the low end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of channel inventory.",1
"Next, Iâd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.6 million Macs, representing 10% year over year growth, which is particularly impressive in the context of IDCâs latest estimate of a 7% global PC market contraction. The growth was led by portables and spurred by the updates to MacBook Air and MacBook Pro in March. We ended the quarter within our 4 to 5 week target range for Mac channel inventory.",1
"Turning to iPad, we sold 12.6 million, compared to 16.4 million in the year ago quarter. iPad sellthrough was 13.7 million, as we reduced channel inventory by about 1.1 million units, coming off the holiday quarter. This left us within our 5 to 7 week target range of iPad channel inventory.",1
"We set a new March quarter record for iPad sales in Japan, and an all-time record for iPad sales in China, but performance in other markets was more muted during the quarter. iPad turns five years old this month, and in every year since its introduction, it has been the number one tablet in sales, in quantity and quality of tablet apps, in usage, and most importantly, in customer satisfaction. And based on the latest data from NPD, iPad maintains a very strong leadership share in all the price bands where we compete.",1
"iPad has also consistently been the number one tablet in enterprise. A recent Changewave survey found that among corporate buyers planning to buy tablets in the next six months, 77% plan to purchase iPads. In fact, we are seeing very high interest from companies who want to use iPads to transform how work gets done.",1
"Turning to services, revenue grew to a new all-time record of $5 billion, an increase of 9% year over year. The growth was led by the App Store, which remains incredibly popular with our customers around the world, with revenue up 29% in the March quarter. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 70% more global revenue in the March quarter than Google Play, up from a 60% lead in the September quarter.",1
"Diluted earnings per share were $2.33, a 40% year over year increase, and cash flow from operations was $19.1 billion, also a new March quarter record. For details by product, I will start with iPhone.",1
"Traffic to our retail and online stores was excellent, with a 22% year over year increase in customer visits. Weâre progressing well with our plans for retail store expansion in Greater China, where we added six new stores in the past quarter alone, bringing us to 21 stores in 11 cities. Weâre on track to have 40 stores open in Greater China by the middle of next year.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $193.5 billion in cash, plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $15.6 billion. Over $171 billion of this cash was offshore. In the March quarter, we issued 6.5 billion U.S. dollar denominated notes and 1.3 billion Swiss franc denominated notes as we continue to diversify our global debt investor base.",1
"Weâve now raised a total of $40 billion of term debt at very attractive rates. We spent $7 billion to repurchase 56.4 million Apple shares through open market transactions, paid $2.7 billion in dividends and equivalents, and utilized about $100 million to [net share] settle vesting employee RSUs. We also retired an additional 13.3 million shares during the quarter, with the conclusion of the accelerated share repurchase program we launched last August.",1
"We have executed our capital return program aggressively, and weâve now taken action on over $112 billion of our $130 billion program, including $80 billion in share repurchases at an average price of $85.",1
"As weâve said consistently, creating value for shareholders by developing great products that enrich peopleâs lives will always be our top priority and the key factor driving our investments and our capital allocation decisions.",1
"With this framework in mind, Appleâs board and management team continue to review capital allocation regularly, and we solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This process allows us to be thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of the program. We very much appreciate all the input that many shareholders have provided us.",1
"We sold 61.2 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 40% year over year growth and demand for iPhone 6 and 6 plus has remained incredibly strong. IPhone sales more than doubled in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam, and they were up 80% or more in several other markets including Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Turkey.",1
"Gross margin was 40.8%, ahead of our expectations, mainly due to stronger than expected iPhone results. Operating margin was 31.5% of revenue and net income was $13.6 billion, a new Q2 record.",1
Thanks Bill. Could we have the next question please.,1
"It features a stunning 12 inch retina display, a new force touch trackpad, all day battery life, and a revolutionary new keyboard. We believe, and I think most everyone agrees, this is the future of the notebook.",1
"Apple is now responsible for creating over 670,000 jobs across the European continent. Most of them have grown out of the success of the App Store, which has generated more than $7.5 billion for European developers since just 2008. We feel great about the economic contribution weâve been able to make in Europe.",1
The two data centers weâre building will run on 100% renewable energy from day one. This is just part of the work weâre doing to protect the environment and leave the world better than we found it.,1
"Today, 100% of Appleâs U.S. operations and 87% of global operations are powered by renewable energy. Just before Earth Day, we announced our plan to move to renewables in China. Weâre undertaking a groundbreaking partnership with several companies to build a 40 megawatt solar farm in Szechuan Province that will generate far more than the amount of energy used by all of our offices and retail stores in China combined.",1
"We also announced an innovative new partnership with the Conservation Fund to permanently protect more than 36,000 acres of working forest in Maine and North Carolina to help offset the impact our packaging has on the worldâs supply of sustainable virgin fiber. Apple is deeply committed to these initiatives and will continue to make them a priority.",1
The June quarter is off to an exciting start with great new products and services. Three of them in particular are giving our customers a glimpse of the future and we are very happy with the reception that each of them is receiving.,1
"First, the all-new MacBook began shipping just over two weeks ago, and we are very happy with the response weâre getting from customers. The new MacBook is our lightest, most compact Mac notebook ever, and you really have to see it to believe it.",1
"Second is the new streaming service from HBO, which is available on Apple TV and iOS. We teamed up with HBO last month to help launch HBO Now, a standalone service that lets customers stream the content they love from HBO on the devices they love from Apple, all without requiring a subscription to cable. HBO now has been incredibly popular with Apple TV users since its debut, and it has been one of the top downloaded apps on the U.S. App Store as well.",1
"Our performance was particularly impressive in our Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific segments. In Greater China, we established an all-time quarterly record for revenue, which grew 71% year over year, to $16.8 billion.",1
"And third, of course, is Apple Watch. Itâs been really great to see the reaction of customers since their watches began arriving on Friday morning. All around the world, weâve seen the excitement on social networks as people start using their Apple Watch. The response has been overwhelmingly positive.",1
"Adding to the surprise and delight of Apple Watch are the more than 3,500 apps that are already available. Our developer community has already seen the potential in this new category and put some of their best thinking into what wearable technology can do. We canât wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up for Apple Watch as we head into our Worldwide Developer Conference six weeks from now.",1
"Iâd like to thank all of those developers and our hundreds of millions of customers for their loyalty and support. Iâd also like to thank all of the Apple employees around the world for their creativity, tireless effort, and passion for delivering the very best products in the world.",1
"With that, Iâll turn the call over to Luca.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. As Tim mentioned, we just completed another outstanding quarter. Revenue for the March quarter was $58 billion, an increase of $12.4 billion or 27% year over year.",1
Growth was driven primarily by the very strong performance of iPhone and the continued strength of the App Store and Mac sales. We achieved these terrific results despite growing foreign exchange headwinds.,1
"We continue to be in the fortunate position of being able to return significant capital to shareholders. We first announced our capital return program three years ago with an initial size of $45 billion, and weâve increased it annually since then. Today, weâre announcing the third update to our program, expanding its size by the largest amount yet and extending its duration.",1
"The existing program was set to conclude at the end of this calendar year, and weâre now extending the program by five quarters to the end of March 2017. Once again, with this update weâre allocating the majority of the expansion of the program to share repurchases, given our strong confidence in the future of Apple and the value we see in our stock.",1
"The board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $50 billion, raising it from the current $90 billion to $140 billion. We will also continue to net share settle vesting employee restricted stock units.",1
"And then as a follow up, research and development spend continues to track well ahead of revenue growth. And that has happened for many quarters now. Can you talk about whatâs driving that? Is there a broader set of projects that youâre working on? Are you making bigger bets, entering bigger markets? Whatâs driving such a long period of elevated R&D spend?",1
"Weâre going to keep doing that, and so weâve already sent some notes out today, moving the customers and versus what we had communicated to them previously. So Iâm generally happy that weâre moving on with the ramp. It is a new product for us, and with any kind of new product, you wind up taking some time to fully ramp.",1
"Having said that, I think weâre in a good position and by sometime in late June, we currently anticipate being in a position that we could begin to sell the Apple Watch in additional countries. And so thatâs our current plan.",1
"From a demand point of view, itâs hard to gauge when you donât have product in stores and so forth. So weâre filling orders completely online at the moment. The customer response from people that have gotten theirs over the weekend have been overwhelmingly positive, and weâre far ahead of where we expected to be from an application point of view.",1
"To give you a comparison, when we launched the iPhone, we had about 500 apps that were ready. When we launched iPad, we had about a thousand. And so our internal goal was to be able to beat the thousand level, and we thought it would be great if we were able to do that by a little bit. And as I mentioned before, we now have over 3,500 apps in the App Store for the watch.",1
"And so we couldnât be happier about how things are going from that point of view. We are learning quickly about customer preferences between the different configurations. Thereâs a much larger breadth of possibilities here for customers than in our other products. And in some cases, we called that well. In some cases, weâre making adjustments to get in line with demand. But Iâm really confident that this is something we really understand how to do and will do.",1
"And so Iâm really happy where we are currently, and happy enough that weâre looking forward to expanding into more countries in late June.",1
"Of course, weâve said this several times now. When you look at our current product portfolio, it is much broader than it used to be. Weâve now developed two new iPhones over the year. We were not doing that a few years ago. Developed two iPads. And of course now we have the Apple Watch.",1
"We also understand that the dividend is very important to many of our investors and weâre raising it for the third time in less than three years. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.47 per share to $0.52 per share, an increase of 11%. This effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today and is payable on May 14, 2015 to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2015.",1
"Weâre also developing some core foundational technologies more in house now than we were in the past. And of course weâre also spending ahead of some of the products that will generate revenues in the future. So when you combined all these factors, that is the reason why you see these research and development increases year over year. Research and development is the core of the company. Innovation is the core of the company.",1
"And weâre very proud of the fact, when you look, for example, at the last two quarters, the first half of 2015, our revenue growth has been higher than our opex growth. And when you look at our expense to revenue ratio, which, for the first half of the year, has been 8.2%, itâs lower than it was a year ago, and itâs definitely something that we consider extremely competitive, and weâre very proud of.",1
Q â Gene Munster,1
"Tim, you mentioned thereâs more switchers versus previous cycles. Any thoughts on what that would mean or could mean for market share over the next few quarters, and kind of I guess the sustainability of the 6 cycle? And then second question, for Luca, in terms of any thoughts on what the margin impact from the watch is that ramps over the next couple of years?",1
"Gene, if you look at the overall worldwide, we grew iPhone 40%. And IDCâs estimate of the market for last quarter is a 16%, so we grew two and a half times. And if you kind of look through at the different countries, in almost every country, we grew at a multiple of the market.",1
"And as I mentioned before, in emerging markets, we did extremely well. And so I feel really good about where we are, and you can hopefully tell with the strong guidance that we provided, that weâre very bullish on the current quarter as well.",1
"Let me talk about supply and demand and sort of separate those two. Right now, demand is greater than supply. And so weâre working hard to remedy that. Weâve made progress over the last week or so, and we were able to deliver more customers an Apple Watch over the weekend than we had initially anticipated.",1
"Yeah, preorders and first week in sales, and any other data points that you track in terms of interest versus, say, when the iPad launched in 2010.",1
"Katie, when you use the word âramp,â I assume youâre talking about supply?",1
Youâve said in the past that the watch may take longer to ramp given the new category and new interface to customers. Is that in fact playing out? Is the watch ramping slower than past product categories?,1
Weâll hear from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Bill, we continue to see a higher rate of switchers than we have seen in previous cycles, and so weâre extremely excited about that. We also continue to see a reasonable percentage of first time buyers, particularly in some of the emerging markets. And if you look at emerging markets in general, I think Luca covered some of this, the revenue from emerging markets, just for the March quarter, was up 58% year on year. And a big piece of what is driving that is iPhone. Obviously, those results would have been higher without some of the FX headwinds that Luca mentioned earlier.",1
"And then as a follow up, obviously, I guess one of the incremental tailwinds to gross margin continues to be the iPhone upside relative to expectations. Can you give us a bit more color on the dynamics of the customer mix for the iPhone? You had mentioned youâre very excited about the new iPhone rate so far, but if you could just give us a bit more color, as we had last quarter, on folks that are new to iPhone, Android switchers, versus replacements?",1
"So we feel very good about the gross margins that weâve generated in the March quarter, and we feel very good about the guidance that we provided, given the severity of the impact.",1
"Weâre dealing with these headwinds. Theyâre part of business, and so weâre dealing with them in many ways. We are looking at, in some cases, at the potential to increase prices in certain markets. Weâre looking of course at our cost structure, and we try to remain as competitive as possible.",1
"And that is exactly what happened in our actual results. So that was pretty much in line with what we were anticipating. Of course, we expect this headwind to continue. And on a sequential basis, when we look into the June quarter, we expect to see another 40 basis points of negative impact from currency.",1
"Iâm gonna give you some numbers on the currency, because I know itâs a topic that is top of mind. Youâre asking about gross margin, and you know, we look at this on a sequential basis. And I mentioned during the call in January that we were expecting FX to have a negative impact on a sequential basis of about 100 basis points after the effect of the hedges.",1
"When we look at the effect of currency on your gross profit, which I think was far less than anyone anticipated, have you be able to reduce some of the pressure by adjusting the terms of your suppliers? Or is that something we should expect to see more of as you progress through the year?",1
"[Operator instructions.] Your first question will come from Bill Schultz, Goldman Sachs.",1
"Thank you, and we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?",1
"Now, as we move ahead into the June quarter, Iâd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $46 billion and $48 billion, compared to $37.4 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%. We expect opex to be between $5.65 billion and $5.75 billion. We expect YNE to be about $350 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%.",1
"As weâve done in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with U.S. cash, future U.S. cash flow generation, and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. And we plan to provide the next update on our program at about this time next year.",1
"We believe this is a meaningful increase for those shareholders who value income, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. With over $11 billion in annual dividend payments, weâre proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In total, the size of our revised capital return program will increase by over 50%, from approximately $130 billion to $200 billion.",1
"Last quarter, we also announced a major economic investment in Europe, where we will spend $2 billion to build data centers in Ireland and Denmark. These will be our largest data centers in the world.",1
"Over 1,000 researchers have contacted us expressing interest in performing studies through ResearchKit. We think these types of solutions have the potential to revolutionize medical studies in life-changing ways, and weâre proud that Apple is helping make this possible.",1
"The first research apps developed using ResearchKit study asthma, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Parkinsonâs disease, and have enrolled over 60,000 iPhone users in just the first few weeks of being available on the App Store.",1
"I think we did a reasonable job of explaining what we think the disconnect was between what we had expected, which we hit it at the high end of our expectation and the street's view of this one. I believe the vast majority of it is that first thing was just channel inventory that maybe we should have been even clearer on last quarter to take into account. But I'm very bullish on iPad.",1
"In the enterprise market, weâre seeing virtually all, 98% of the Fortune 500 that using iPad. And weâre seeing, according to Good Technology who looks at activations of tablets, the latest data we have from them is that 91% of the activation of tablets in enterprise were iPads. And so this is also an astonishing number and many of those enterprises are writing apps that are key proprietary apps for running that business, and this is great for that company because theyâre more productive as a result of that. And so once again, just like in education in a way, what we have to do in enterprise is focus on penetration. It has to be deeper and broader. But in terms of having people begin the process, beginning writing apps, weâre doing a pretty good job of that.",1
"In the retail market, if you look at the U.S. as a proxy, the NPD numbers for March just came out a few days ago and we had 46% share and embedded in that 46%, thereâs a lot of things in there that I personally wouldnât put in the same category as iPad and that are weighing the share down. Itâs certainly a market we wouldnât play in and a type of product you would never see an Apple brand on. So we feel like weâre doing well there. Office, I believe does help. Itâs very unclear to say how much. I believe if it would have been done earlier, it would have been even better for Microsoft frankly.",1
"There is a lots of alternatives out there from a productivity point of view, some of which we brought to the market, some of which many, many innovative companies have brought. But I do see that Office is still a very key franchise in the enterprise, in particular. And I think having it on iPad is good, and I wholeheartedly welcome Microsoft to the App Store to sell Office. Our customers are clearly responding in a good way that itâs available. So, I do think it helps us particularly in the enterprise area.",1
"The other things you look at on iPad that are just blow away as customer sat is 98. There is almost nothing in the world with a 98% customer sat and the intention to buy numbers look good with two-thirds of the people planning to buy a tablet or planning to buy an iPad. The usage numbers are off the chart, far and exceeding Android tablets, four times the web traffic of all Android tablets combined.",1
"And so, when I backup from all of these, I feel great. That doesnât mean that every quarter, every 90 days is going to be a number that everybody is thrilled with. But what it means to me is that the trend over the arc of time that things look very, very good, that iPad has a great future. And of course the thing that drives us more than any of this are the next iPads if you will, the things that are in the pipeline, the things that we can do to make the product even better and there is no shortage of work going in on that nor any shortage of ideas.",1
"And so when I backup from all of this, I canât help but still be extremely excited about where we are.",1
"Okay, very complete thank you. One other question, when you look at Google and Amazon and Facebook, they've very much diversified their business over time in a way that one has rarely seen. Apple, sort of the opposite. People say you ought to buy this or that and you'll do acquisitions, but you're obviously very focused. Is that because it's just a management philosophy of wanting to be more focused than some of these other companies? Or is there something about Apple's products that particularly being more hardware oriented that kind of prevents you from saying, yes, let's go make TV shows or let's go often do something else, even though you probably have the money and the technical capability to do all these things?",1
"I think that this quarter, if you were unsure, hopefully this quarter demonstrates to you that we can do well in a number of geographies from emerging markets to develop markets. Some of the numbers that we've experienced just to quote some of the more historic prepaid market through the first half of 2014; Brazil was up 61%, Russia was up 97%, Turkey was up 56%, India was up 55%, Vietnam was up 262%.",1
"The key thing for us, Steve, is to stay focused on things that we can do best and that we can perform at a really high-level of quality that our customers have come to expect. And so we currently feel comfortable in expanding the number of things we're working on. So we've been doing that in the background and we're not ready yet to pull the string on the curtain. But we've got some great things there. We're working on them. Very, very proud of and very, very excited about.",1
"But for us, we care about every detail and when you care about every detail and getting it right, it takes a bit longer to do that and that's always been the case, that's not something that just occur. As you probably know from following us for a long time, we didn't ship the first MP3 player, nor the first smartphone, nor the first tablet. In fact, there were tablets being shipped a decade or so before then, but arguably, we shipped the first successful modern tablet and the first successful modern smartphone and the first successful modern MP3 player. And so it means much more to us to get it right than to be first.",1
"I think you can see so many examples out in the marketplace, where it's clear that the objective has been to be first. But customers at the end of the day don't care about that. That's not what they look for from Apple. They want great, insanely great and that's what we want to deliver, and so that's the way we look at it.",1
"From an acquisition point of view, we have done 24 in 18 months. That shows that we're on the prowl, I suppose you could say. We look for companies that have great people and great technology and that fit culturally. And we don't have a rule that says we can't spend a lot or whatever. We'll spend what we think is a fair price. What's important to us is that strategically it makes sense and that it winds up adding value to our shareholders over the long haul. We are not in a race to spend the most or acquire the most. We're in a race to make the worlds' best product that really enrich people's lives.",1
"So, to the tune that acquisitions can help us do that and they've done that and continue to do that, then we will acquire it. And so you can bet that you will continue to see acquisitions and some of which we'll try to keep quiet and some of which seems to be impossible to keep quiet.",1
"Thank you. First I just want to tell Peter, thank you very much, we've really enjoyed working with you over the past 10 years. But then secondly, in terms of a question for Tim, can you talk a bit about the competitive landscape for smartphone? If you look at some of your competitors seem to be have cut prices fairly quickly in the most recent product cycle, perhaps faster than before. You've got Microsoft about to close on Nokia. Lenovo is buying Motorola, there is a lot going on from a sort of competitive standpoint. So I'm curious as to how you're seeing the market?",1
"Looking at it by market a bit, which I think is important. I think Luca mentioned a little bit of this in his comments. In the education market in the U.S., we have a 95% share. And so the focus in education is on penetration, is on getting more schools to buy and my belief is the match has been lit, and itâs very clear to the educators that have studied this is that student achievement is higher with iPad in the classroom than without it. And so Iâm confident weâve got a really great start in education far beyond the U.S. now. This is happening in many, many parts of the world.",1
"And so, if you really look at it in just four years after we launched the very first iPad, weâve sold over 210 million, which is more than we or I think anyone thought was possible at that period of time. And itâs interesting to note that thatâs almost twice as many iPhones that weâve sold in a comparable period of time, and over seven times as many iPods as weâve sold in the period of time. So, I think itâs important to kind of to put that in perspective. Weâve come a long way very, very quickly.",1
"Itâs a good question. Letâs talk about iPad a little more than we did in the comments. When I backup from iPad, hereâs what I see. It absolutely has been the fastest growing product in Appleâs history and itâs been the only product that weâve ever made that was instantly a hit in three of our key markets, from consumer to business including the enterprise and education.",1
"Thank you. Tim, I understand that the iPad is not as weak as it appears on a sell-through basis, but still itâs relatively flat over the last year in terms of sell-through. What are your thoughts in terms of why that is and can that accelerate with Office on the iPad going forward?",1
And from UBS weâll hear from Steve Milunovich.,1
"Thank you, Tony. Could we have the next question please?",1
"The most important thing, Toni, that we do is to make great products that really get our users excited to want the next one and that will always be the case. And you can bet that thatâs where the vast majority of all of our attention is on doing this thing. In terms of the BOM pressure of any new product, you have seen in the past that exists. I think youâve also seen that we have a way of working down the cost curve. That was certainly very key in achieving the 39.3% gross margin from this past quarter. And as I said before, we price things at a level that is fair for the value that we are providing, and so weâre certainly not stuck on certain price points. We price that values that are fair for the value that we are delivering.",1
"Okay. And any comments on the latter part of that around, sort of the imperative to continue to come out with really great products that ensure people have an incentive to upgrade, yet when weâve seen you really revolutionize phones between iterations weâve seen margin pressure?",1
"It's probably also important to know that the bulk of the things you're seeing in the U.S. are not occurring in many of the other geos in terms of the upgrade policies and so forth. I mean, each country has its own kind of cadence associated with this, and the U.S. is â itâs in the 30% of our business, not 100%. So itâs important to weigh it with a proper perspective.",1
"And as you know from following us for a while, our ability to keep customers is very good and our ability to show other products that Apple produces to a family that's buying Apple product is also very good. And so, at the macro level, I see the opportunity of the market and getting more people into the Apple ecosystem much larger than any of the noise around the different carrier plans, some of which I think helped, and some of which I think worked the opposite way and it's completely unclear to me how those net.",1
"But regardless of how those balance, what I see as the bigger opportunity for Apple is that the smartphone market is still only 1 billion or so units and it will eventually take over the entire mobile phone market. We've seen our ability to attract new users to iPhone to be very significant in the emerging markets. We were seeing new to iPhone numbers on the iPhone 4s sales in the 80 percentages in certain large geos. So, this to us give us a great comfort that we can continue to grow and we may not be able to attract some of those buyers to our top phone because of the price point. But if we can get them in on the entry iPhone, it gives them a great product, at a great value and gets them into the ecosystem.",1
"So I think there is some that work that way. I think there is some that work the way that more of the way that you're leaning, and how these balanced are very difficult currently to conclude.",1
"There is a lot there, let me see if I can address it quickly and I want to just add one thing to the point that you asked Luca. Just to be clear on the iPhone 4 question, we sold a very, very low single-digit percentage of those and so it had extremely minimal impact of results on the quarter. In terms of the general upgrade or the installed base, some of the programs that the carriers are running may serve to increase the upgrade cycle because there are some areas where customers can pay a bit more in the beginning and have the ability to essentially upgrade each year.",1
"I guess, the other consideration is the imperative for Apple to continue to introduce really great products to want to have people upgrade at the same frequency. And I guess, the dilemma in doing that is as we've seen with the 5 and with the 4 is introducing really great products, typically puts pressure on your BOM and pressures margin. So perhaps you could just tell us how you think conceptually about where you think replacement cycles go over time and why? And then secondly, how do you address this dilemma of well in order to make a great phone it typically costs more to do so and managing their potential margin pressure.",1
"Okay. Tim, I was wondering if you could talk about how you think about replacement cycles generally for the iPhone over the longer term. Clearly U.S. carriers have started introducing plans that may ultimately encourage people to keep their phone longer than two years, because their total price paid is less. And so one could argue and I'd like your opinion on whether you think that could push out replacement cycles.",1
"Yes, Toni. When you look at the $41 of decline, I would say about half of that was driven by the fact that we have continued to do very well in emerging markets with the 4s. I have mentioned that there is a lot of markets where we've grown very strongly in Latin America, in Asia-Pacific, in Eastern Europe. So, about half of that decline came from the stronger sales of the 4s. And then the rest was primarily the fact that, again as we move away from the quarter where we launched a product, we tend to have lower capacity mix in our numbers.",1
"Yes. Thank you. Peter best wishes going forward. I have one question for Luca and a follow-up for Tim please. Luca, on the iPhone ASPs this quarter, they were down a little over $40. I think that was the largest sequential decline that we've seen in history. I was wondering if you could help us understand what drove that. Was it entirely mix? You mentioned good growth in each of the three models, but were you seeing particularly strong growth in the 4s? I think you mentioned that in China. And how significant if any was selling older generation for iPhone 4?",1
"Yes, there is a lot of moving parts, a lot of acquisitions, a lot of people giving up to some degree and deciding to do other things. But at the end of the day we see it much like we've always seen it, as the part of the market that we're interested in is the market of people that really want the best smartphone and that doesn't mean that they're all at the high end of the price stand. I mean, we have smartphones that go down to a very affordable price with the 4S because we're proud to ship that product.",1
"I could go on, but the point is that there's a number of markets out there where we are beginning to really catch on to a number of customers, and I am particularly proud of the results in these markets because these have not been historic strong points for Apple. We've been working at China for a while and have learned a lot and I'm very proud of what we've done there. But I think some of these other numbers I just read demonstrates that we're beginning to have really nice success outside of there as well.",1
"And last month we announced ResearchKit, an open source software framework that helps doctors and scientists gather data from medical research participants more efficiently and accurately using iPhone applications. The response so far has been simply amazing, far exceeding our expectations.",1
"Weâre now halfway through fiscal 2015 and our year to date results have been simply staggering. We sold over 135 million iPhones, 34 million iPads, and 10 million Macs in the first six months of the year. Our revenue has grown by 28% to over $132 billion, net income has increased 36% to over $31 billion, and EPS has grown by 44%.",1
"Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Appleâs Form 10-K for 2014, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2015, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press releases.",1
"Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. Iâd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.",1
"Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us. We have a lot of great news to talk about, so Iâll jump right in. Today, weâre reporting our strongest March quarter ever, with 27% revenue growth and 40% earnings per share growth year over year.",1
"Weâre seeing fantastic results for iPhone, with revenue growth of 55% year on year, and weâre seeing a higher rate of switchers than weâve experienced in previous iPhone cycles. The success of iPhone has been extremely strong in emerging markets, where unit sales were up 63% year on year.",1
"The App Store had its best quarter ever, with a record number of customers making purchases, driving a new record for revenue and 29% year on year growth. We also reached an all-time quarterly record of $5 billion in total services revenue.",1
"We also continue to defy the trend of declining global PC sales, with double digit Mac unit growth in a market that IVC estimates contracted by 7%.",1
"Weâre making many strategic investments in Appleâs future, in research and development, in our supply chain, and in our infrastructure, and weâve made 27 acquisitions in the last six quarters. Weâre in the very fortunate position of generating more cash than we need to run our business, and keep making these important investments.",1
"Great and then, if you can just, actually as a follow-up on the China side, I think it grew at 13% year-over-year, and you mentioned obviously China Mobile has been the driver of that. But can you talk about some of the other categories as well, and perhaps some of the other carriers in terms of where you're seeing demand out of China?",1
"So today, weâre announcing another significant update to our capital return program, expanding its size to $200 billion through March of 2017 to reflect our strong confidence in what lies ahead for Apple. Luca will go into this in more detail in a moment.",1
Weâre also making great progress in many other areas. The Apple ecosystem continues to expand in exciting ways. Weâre seeing great momentum with Apple Pay. Discover announced today that its cardmembers in the United States will be able to make contactless payments in participating stores through Apple Pay beginning this fall.,1
"And last month, we said that the number of locations accepting Apple Pay has tripled, and we continue to see great progress with merchants. Best Buy, which has been a longtime, strong partner of ours, has just announced that itâs now offering Apple Pay in-app and later this year will offer Apple Pay in all of their U.S. stores.",1
"And merchants arenât the only ones jumping onboard. Earlier this month, a leading healthcare payment network announced acceptance of Apple Pay for its clients, so over 50 major hospitals across the country, including Stanford Healthcare and Aspen Valley, will accept Apple Pay this year for copays and bill payments at registration and check in.",1
"Weâre also incredibly inspired by the momentum weâre seeing in health-related solutions. Since we released HealthKit with iOS 8 last September, over 1,000 apps have been developed to transform how people track, manage, and interact with their health and theyâre now available on the App Store.",1
"Just this past weekend, Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles turned on the largest HealthKit integration to date, giving more than 87,000 patients the ability to share their health and fitness data seamlessly with their MyCS link app, which syncs with their electronic medical record.",1
"Please note that some of the information youâll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for dividends, share repurchases, and public debt issuance.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, weâll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Good day everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated second quarter fiscal year 2015 earnings release conference call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, maâam.",1
"And with that ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude todayâs presentation. We do thank everyone for your participation.",1
"Thank you, Gene. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone and numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and please enter confirmation code 5206019. And these replays will be available by approximately 5.00 PM Pacific Time today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896 and financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570, and I'm at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
You bet.,1
"Excellent, thank you.",1
"I haven't had a chance to evaluate exactly what it is and don't have a personal point of view on that yet. But if I look broadly at the content on Apple TV, I think it compares extremely favorable to the content that is on the Amazon box. We've sold now, Gene, about 20 million of the Apple TV, and so we've got a pretty large installed base there. And I'm feeling quite good about that business and where it can go.",1
"We had HBO GO already on Apple TV and you have to authenticate in order to use it, but you have to do that with Amazon service as well from my brief read of their announcement. I think they in addition to that got some older content from HBO to put on there.",1
"Good questions, Gene. The reason that I stripped off the hobby label is that when you look at the sales of the Apple TV box itself, and you look at a content that was bought directly off of Apple TV for 2013, that number was over $1 billion. And so, it didnât feel right to me to refer to something thatâs over $1 billion as a hobby. Also from an investment point of view, we continue to make the product better and better. And so it doesnât feel right from that point of view either.",1
"Hey, good afternoon and Iâll add congratulations to Peter on itinerary for the record there. And Tim, I want to talk a little bit about some of your comments at the recent shareholder meeting. You mentioned that Apple TV is no longer a hobby. Wanted to hear a little bit about why you made that distinction? And separately, it would be interesting to hear your feedback on the HBO Amazon announcement today and what you think that means, if anything, in terms of some content partners being a little more â work with some more players like yourself? Thanks.",1
And from Piper Jaffray we got Gene Munster.,1
"Weâre up to 40,000 points of sales now in iPhone, but weâre not nearly where we need to be on the rest of our product line and even the 40,000 is a low number in considering the broad landmass and the number of folks in China. And so, I feel like thereâs still loads of opportunity there, and feel really, really good about how weâre doing.",1
"For the first half, including our retail stores, Greater China revenue topped $19 billion. So this is a 21% year-over-year, and is our fastest growing region. So, weâre looking at this data and deciding to continue investing in a big way. We plan to triple the number of Apple Retail Stores over the next two years. Weâre continuing to expand in online. Weâre continuing to build out channels.",1
"Also, Iâd mentioned this briefly with Steve, but I think itâs important to point out that if you look at some of the numbers weâre seeing on first-time iPhone buyers, people that bought the iPhone 4s, 85% were first-time iPhone buyers, and the 5c, 69% first-time iPhone buyers. So these are extraordinary, and as you would expect, these are also heavily Android switchers. 62% of the people that bought the 4s switched from Android. 60% of the people that bought the 5c switched from Android. And so weâre incredibly pleased with this.",1
"If you look at the iTunes software and services revenue in China, we more than doubled it. Year-over-year, we were in the triple digits percentages. And if you look at iPad and you take out the channel inventories, ins and outs and look at demand instead of sell in, we grew by 6% and that compares to IDCâs forecast of a flat tablet market in China for last quarter. And so we literally did well in every single area in China. It wasnât just because we were able to come to an agreement with the worldâs largest carrier. That was certainly key, but as you can tell from the rest of these numbers there are other things going on.",1
"Yes, really great question. We did have an all-time revenue record in Greater China, just under $10 billion at $9.8 billion. iPhone sales were up 28%, that's versus the IDCs market forecast of 20% growth. So we gained share. Mac units were up double-digit, in particular they were up 13%, and that's far outpacing IDCs PC market forecast of a negative 8%. So we gained share there as well.",1
"And the new iPad's gorgeous retina display, advanced chip and enhanced cameras and sensors are designed to support the next generation of apps for immersive augmented reality experiences in the classroom.",1
"In addition to our successful Everyone Can Code initiative, we've launched Everyone Can Create. It's a new free curriculum that makes it fun and easy for teachers to integrate drawing, music, film making or photography into their existing lesson plans for any subject.",1
"We believe education is the great equalizer. And whether it's through our coding programs, our unrivaled augmented reality platform, or the creativity both can unleash, we're proud to help students everywhere reach new frontiers of learning with Apple technology.",1
"We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $11.1 billion and $11.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million and our tax rate to be around 14.5%. Finally, reflecting the approved 7% dividend increase I just mentioned, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on May 13, 2021, to shareholders of record as of May 10, 2021.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with over $204 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $14 billion of new term debt and retired $3.5 billion of term debt leaving us with total debt of almost $122 billion. As a result, net cash was $83 billion at the end of the quarter.",1
"This strong position allows us to continue to invest confidently in our future, while also returning value to our shareholders. We are innovating and investing at an unprecedented pace, including accelerating our investment in the United States with our new commitment to contribute more than $430 billion and 20,000 jobs to the country over the next five years.",1
"As we continue to execute at an extremely high level, we were also able to return nearly $23 billion to shareholders during the March quarter. This included $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19 billion through open market repurchases of 147 million Apple shares. We continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.",1
"Given the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our Board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases. We're also raising our dividend by 7% to $0.22 per share, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward.",1
"As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights assuming that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are seeing today for the current quarter.",1
"We expect our June quarter revenue to grow strong double digits year-over-year. However, we believe that the sequential revenue decline from the March quarter to the June quarter will be greater than in prior years for two reasons. First, keep in mind that due to the later launch timing and strong demand, iPhone only achieved supply-demand balance during the March quarter. This will cause a steeper sequential decline than usual. Second, we believe supply constraints will have a revenue impact of $3 billion to $4 billion in the June quarter.",1
"Thank you, Luca. [Operator Instructions] Operator, may we have the first question, please?",1
"In the enterprise market, customers across many industries are accelerating their adoption of iPhone 12 and 5G as a key platform for the future of their business. Delta Airlines, for example, is putting iPhone 12 and 5G connectivity into the hands of flight attendants so they can provide the best passenger service possible as air travel rebounds.",1
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.,1
"Tim, I had sort of a big picture question on iPhone. I'm just curious, there are so many different things happening in this cycle, 5G, pandemic. How are you thinking about the opportunity for refreshing the installed base and attracting new customers? And are you seeing lives shorten given some of the programs that are being put out there by the carriers and by yourself? Just kind of maybe big picture, if you can talk about what you're seeing in terms of iPhone out there in the market.",1
"Sure, Shannon. We saw double-digit increases on a year-over-year basis on both the new to iPhone and upgraders. So -- and in fact, in the March quarter, there was actually a record number of upgraders for a March quarter. And so we like what we see. It's obviously the early days of 5G. Different countries are in different points. But penetration is still -- on a global level, is still low at this point. And so a lot of the 5G upgrades will be in front of us, not behind us. You see in China, things have moved quickly to 5G. They're moving quickly in the United States. But a lot of the other regions are slower to adopt and slower to gain coverage in 5G.",1
"Okay. And then, Luca, can you talk about gross margin? I mean 42% is higher than it's been that I can kind of remember actually at this point, so maybe if you talk about the drivers of gross margin, and maybe if there were any offsets from higher component costs or the logistics costs that obviously were overshadowed by currency and other things?",1
"Yes, Shannon. Yes, we did 42.5% during March, and we've guided to similar, slightly lower levels for June. So for March, we were up 270 basis points sequentially, really driven by three major factors. Cost savings, which has been good for us during the cycle. A really strong mix, a strong mix on iPhone, but in general, across all product categories, and that obviously was helpful. And foreign exchange sequentially, again, from December to March, was favorable 90 basis points. So that helped as well. So those are the three major factors there. As we transition into June, as you know, that we will expect some level of deleverage but that will be offset by cost savings. Foreign exchange doesn't have much of an impact as we go from March to June.",1
We'll now take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.,1
"Openreach in the U.K. has started equipping tens of thousands of field engineers with iPhone 12 to speed up their deployment of broadband services to homes around the country. And UCHealth, a large health care provider in Colorado, was able to reduce per patient vaccination time from 3 minutes to only 30 seconds largely by moving from PC stations to iPhones. This has allowed their staff to rapidly scan and register new patients and vastly increase their daily vaccination capacity.",1
"Both Mac and iPad are incredibly relevant products for our customers in the current working and learning environments, and we are delighted that the most recent surveys of U.S. consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 91% for Mac and 94% for iPad. With this level of customer satisfaction, and with around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter being new to that product, the active installed base for both products continues to grow nicely and reached new all-time highs.",1
"As we look forward to WWDC, we're taking new steps to support and foster the unmatched community of developers we work with here in the United States and around the world. I'm particularly excited about our inaugural Entrepreneur Camp for black founders and developers. Building on the success of our Entrepreneur Camp program, which we began in 2019, this program gives this profoundly innovative community of developers the chance to develop next-level technical skills through hands-on technology labs, and with our partners at Harlem Capital, it also shares insights and mentorship on building and scaling an app business.",1
"Products revenue was a March quarter record of $72.7 billion, up 62% over a year ago. As a result of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached a new all-time record in each of our major product categories. Our services set an all-time record of $16.9 billion, growing 27% over a year ago. We established new records in each geographic segment and in most service categories. I will provide more details about the performance of our services business later.",1
"Looking forward, whether you're running a business or just hoping to see family again after more than a year, it's tempting at this moment to let hope about the end of the COVID-19 pandemic outstripped clear-eyed realism about the challenges we still face. In many places around the world, new waves of infections driven by even more infectious variants of the virus are driving new lockdowns. Instead of simply assuming that the end is in sight, we at Apple are doing our part to make it a reality.",1
"Beginning with an enduring and uncompromising commitment to the health and safety of our teams, and extending well beyond our walls into the communities where we work. We also want to do everything we can to connect users to life-saving vaccinations that are in ever greater supply. Through Apple Maps, for example, we now showcase vaccine site locations here in the United States, building on our maps of testing locations in many countries around the world.",1
"It's worth remembering for much more than financial reasons or year-ago compares, just how we felt at this time last year when everything we knew had to change. Plains set grounded, entire business districts were empty and silent. People left groceries or care packages sitting in the garage or in the hall overnight in recognition of all that we didn't know and therefore, had to imagine.",1
"Thanks to researchers and scientists, doctors and nurses, everyone who can put a shot in an arm and even just check a name off a list. We have reached new days of hopeful resolve. Our work is not done, but as I said a year ago, while we can't say for sure how many chapters are in this book, we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely pleased to report record results for our March quarter despite continued uncertainty in the macro environment. We've been operating in new ways for over a year, and we could not be more proud of the way our team continues to execute and innovate at unprecedented levels.",1
"Our revenue reached a March quarter record of $89.6 billion, an increase of over $31 billion or 54% from a year ago. We grew very strong double digits in each of our product categories, with all-time records for Mac and for Services and March quarter records for iPhone and for Wearables, Home and Accessories. We also set new March quarter records in every geographic segment with growth of at least 35% in each one of them.",1
"Company gross margin was 42.5%, up 270 basis points from last quarter driven by cost savings, a strong mix and favorable foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 36.1%, growing 100 basis points sequentially also thanks to cost savings and FX, partially offset by seasonal loss of leverage. Services gross margin was 70.1%, up 170 basis points sequentially and mainly due to a different mix. Net income of $23.6 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.40 and operating cash flow of $24 billion were all March quarter records by a wide margin.",1
iPad performance was also outstanding with revenue of $7.8 billion up 79%. We grew very strongly in every geographic segment with an all-time record in Japan and a March quarter record in rest of Asia Pacific.,1
"Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenues had a March quarter record of $47.9 billion, growing 66% year-over-year as the iPhone 12 family continue to be in high demand. Performance was consistently strong across the world as we grew strong double digits in each geographic segment and set March quarter records in most markets we track. Thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem, our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high. In the U.S. the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of over 99% for the iPhone 12 family.",1
"Turning to Services. We reached an all-time revenue record of $16.9 billion with all-time records for the App Store, cloud services, music, video, advertising and payment services. Our new service offerings, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News Fitness+ as well as the Apple One bundle, continue to scale across users, content and features and are contributing to overall services growth. The key drivers for our services business all continue to move in the right direction.",1
"Good day and welcome to the Apple Computer's First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead Ms. Paxton.",1
"Finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love, while also continuing to improve the breadth and quality of our current service offerings. For example, Apple Arcade launched its biggest expansion yet adding incredibly fun games to the catalog, including new exclusive Arcade originals, along with two entirely new categories, App Store greats and timeless classics. Apple Pay continues to expand geographically, launching in Mexico and in South Africa, bringing our payment service to six continents.",1
"Wearables, Home and Accessories grew 25% year-over-year to $7.8 billion, setting new March quarter revenue records in every geographic segment. Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We're very excited about the future of this category and believe that our integration of hardware, software and services uniquely positions us to provide great customer experiences in this category.",1
"Next, I'd like to talk about Mac. We set an all-time revenue record of $9.1 billion, up 70% over last year, and grew very strongly in each geographic segment with all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and March quarter records in the Americas, Greater China and Japan. This amazing performance was driven by the very enthusiastic customer response to our new Macs powered by the M1 chip.",1
"I have two as well. First one, just on services, I think 90 days ago, the expectation was that line item would decelerate a little bit into the March quarter. It turned out it actually accelerated for us. I'd like to just understand what do you think drove that acceleration specifically? And is mid-20% sort of the growth norm as we go forward for Services?",1
"So Amit, -- our Services business did better than what we were expecting when we had the last call in January. It was stronger across the board. One of the things that we've noticed is that throughout COVID was that obviously digital services have done very well. And then we've had a couple of categories like Apple Care because many of the points of sale and stores were closed and advertising because of the reduced economic activity that were negatively affected during COVID.",1
"During the March quarter, we've seen a return to growth on Apple Care and obviously, we've reopened a lot of the stores during the course of the quarter. And advertising, obviously, consumer sentiment has improved and advertising is coming back. And so the combination of these factors really delivered this very, very strong performance during the March quarter. As we look ahead, as you know, we don't provide specific guidance for our product categories.",1
"Aaron, let me give you a little color on that. The iPhone 12 of the -- the iPhone 12 family are or more broadly affect all iPhones. The iPhone 12 is the most popular. But we did see very strong sales of the Pro portion of the family as well, the Pro plus the Pro Max. And so the revenue that you're seeing is a function of unit growth and revenue per unit growth. Does that help?",1
"Okay. As my follow-up, Luca, on the June quarter guide, when you talk about the sequential decline being a little bit about perhaps the 13% or low-teens percent that we've seen historically. Are the supply constraints of the $3 billion, $4 billion impact included in that? Or is that in addition to sort of the more than average sequential decline that you're referring to? And any color on what specifically is driving the supply constraints of the subcomponent level?",1
"So when you look at our normal seasonality, and you've mentioned a percentage that is really an average of several years, what we're saying is that we believe that the sequential decline this year is going to be higher than that. And it's a combination of the two factors, right? One is the timing of the launch and then the very high demand for iPhone during the March quarter. And the $3 billion to $4 billion supply constraints that we mentioned.",1
"Yes, and the constraints come from the semiconductor shortages that are affecting many, many industries, and it's a combination of the shortages as well as the very, very high level of demand that we are seeing for both iPad and Mac. For Mac, for example, if you just -- just to keep it into context, the last three quarters of Mac have been the best three quarters ever in the history of the product, right?",1
"So we are experiencing an incredible level of demand, which certainly is favored by working from home and learning from home environment, but also by the incredible amount of new products and innovation that we put into the products that we launched during the last couple of quarters.",1
We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.,1
"Congratulations on the great quarter. I wanted to go back to iPhone. As we think about the iPhone 12 cycle, appreciating that you guys don't give actual shipment numbers, it would appear though that the mix has been quite healthy. So I'm wondering if you could give us any context of what in this cycle you're seeing in terms of the mix relative to past cycles? Is that mix sustainable? I'm just trying to understand kind of the mix of -- within the iPhones and how that's driving, I guess, particularly gross margin. And I have a follow-up.",1
Yes. Can you give any context of how that might have changed this cycle relative to the prior cycles? Have we seen kind of a structural change to the higher band of the product category that you believe can be sustained going forward?,1
"But in general, I talked during our prepared remarks, I mean, there are a number of things that we always look at around the Services business, how many new paid accounts do we have, what number of new subscriptions do we get that -- above all, is our installed base continuing to grow? Are we adding new services? Are we improving the quality of the existing services? And so, when we look at all these fundamental vectors of our Services business, obviously we feel very good. We feel very good about it.",1
We don't predict going forward other than for our internal use. But we're really happy with the results.,1
"Okay. And then as a quick follow-up back to the supply constraints. I guess it's hard to kind of see again, looking forward beyond this quarter. But what's your best assessment of when maybe the supply constraints could ease? Do you have any views of just the industry in general, overcoming some of the supply constraint dynamics?",1
"Most of our issue is on legacy nodes. And so on legacy nodes, there are many different people, not only in the same industry, but across other industries that are using legacy nodes. And so in order to really answer that question on -- accurately, we would need to know the true demand from each of these players and how that's going to change over the next few months. And so it's very, very difficult to give you good answer. I think we have a good handle on our demand. But what everybody else is doing, I don't know. And so we will do our best. That's what I can tell you.",1
"Congratulations on a very nice quarter. Question on semis supply as well. You just beat by a substantial margin on the top line in the March quarter. I'm curious what went in your favor to be able to secure that kind of supply that you were able to beat by, I think it was $11 million or so? And then I had a follow-up.",1
We did not have a material supply shortage in Q2. And so how are we able to do that? You wind up collapsing all of your buffers and offsets. And that happens all the way through the supply chain. And so that enables you to go a bit higher than what we were expecting to sell when we went into the quarter 90 days ago.,1
"That's very helpful. And then for my follow-up, I know there's a lot of moving parts, Tim, but with the economy sort of reopening here in the U.S., and you mentioned about supply constraints possibly on the Mac and the iPad. I was curious if I can get your thoughts, maybe just color-wise, on what you would expect for those two categories, Macs and the iPads in the second half of this year.",1
"In terms of other services and pricing, I don't have anything to announce today. We try to give the customer a great value. And we feel that we're doing that in the -- with the prices that we've got. And we'll see where we go from here.",1
"To date, we've received -- the Apple originals have received 352 award nominations and had 98 wins. And this is from Oscar nominations to Indie awards to Critic Choice awards and all the rest. And we've got some shows that are -- have gotten significant buzz like Ted Lasso and The Morning Show and Defending Jacob and many others. And so we feel really good about where we are. We're not releasing subscriber numbers. But we feel good about where we are.",1
"TV+ -- let me start with TV+. TV+ is going very well. As you know, the objective and the philosophy that we've had on TV+ is to create high-quality original content and to be one of the most desired platforms for storytellers. And I see that happening day by day as we sign more shows and more storytellers including Malala as I'd mentioned in my opening comments.",1
"Tim, your content offerings are still at very compelling price points. And you've seen other content providers, whether it be Spotify, Hulu, Netflix, all announced price increases recently. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about pricing as it pertains to your offering here? And if you could share any stats around the uptake of TV+ paid subs that would be great. And I have a follow-up for Luca.",1
"From a channel inventory standpoint, we did what we normally do during a March quarter. So we reduced inventory as it's typical on iPhone. We exited within our target range. So I would say that on the inventory side, it was pretty straightforward Obviously, given that the supply constraints are on the iPad and on the Mac, we wish we had more inventory of iPad and Mac. But this is all a function of high demand for all our products.",1
"No. On -- as you think about the June quarter, Katy, I would point you to what we said in our prepared remarks around the two factors that will influence our normal seasonality, right? One is the fact that iPhone, we launched iPhone later than usual during this cycle. And so we reached supply-demand balance only during the March quarter, which makes obviously the sequential decline steeper than usual. And then this $3 billion or $4 billion of supply constraints that Tim just said, primarily on iPad and Mac. So as you look at your model and you obviously can look at our numbers that we've done in the past, I think you can try to gauge that.",1
"And then, Luca, as I look at inventory plus vendor nontrade receivables, that grew only about 8% this quarter which is a big deceleration from last quarter. Should we read into that as a leading indicator for how we should think about the revenue growth deceleration in the business as the world normalizes? Or were there some supply disruptions during the quarter that caused you to drain inventory and create that tightness that you're talking about for June?",1
"If you look at Wearables then, the watch had a fabulous quarter. And I still think we're in the early innings on the watch. The number of new -- people that are new to the watch is almost three out of four. And so this is a long way from being a mature market. And so -- and then the Services by itself has really accelerated. And so all in all, we feel very, very good.",1
"And where this pandemic will end, it seems like many companies will be operating in a hybrid kind of mode. And so it would seem that work from home and the productivity of working from home will remain very critical.",1
"The demand feels very strong right now. Both on the Mac side, you have the combination of M1 and work from home and remote learning. And then iPad, you've got remote learning and work from home as well. And the product that we just announced is really killer, the iPad Pro with the M1 in it. And so there's a lot of great things of the strength of the product cycle in addition to the trends that we're seeing in the marketplace.",1
"And so part of the growth is compared -- is the comparison point. But that said, the results were fabulous across the board. The shortages that Luca spoke about in the color that he provided on the future, affect primarily the iPad and the Mac. And so we'll have some challenges in there, and challenges in meeting the demand that we've got.",1
"If you sort of look at the different products, iPhone, I've already mentioned some of the great momentum that we had there. Keep in mind that the compare that we're running to would be the quarter, the Q2 of last year is the quarter that China would have entered a shutdown first and then the rest of the world entered the shutdown in middle part of March.",1
"This was a pretty unbelievable quarter, and investors are going to ask about the sustainability of current demand trends, especially as you lap some of the benefits from COVID in areas like services and Mac later this year. So I know you don't guide beyond or provide an outlook beyond the next quarter. But can you talk from a high level over the next year, which segments do you see the opportunity to maintain strong revenue growth versus where is it reasonable to assume there will be some digestion as consumers shift their spending priorities? And then I have a follow-up for Luca.",1
We'll take our next question from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.,1
"But clearly, we like what we see right now a lot. If you look at how the iPhone did around the world, we had the top five models of smartphone in the U.S., the top selling, the top two in urban China, four out of the top five in Japan, the top four in the U.K., and the top six in Australia. And so, it was sort of across the board in some really key countries, we did really, really well. I do think that the 5G cycle is important, and we're in the early days of it, frankly.",1
"Yes. We're clearly seeing strong performance in both the new to iPhone or the switcher component and upgraders as I'd mentioned before. And in fact, the upgrader was the best March quarter that we've ever had in -- and so that speaks to what you're seeing, I think, a lot. It's difficult with just this far into the cycle to make a statement about the cycle in general because keep in mind that we just launched midway through the Q1 period. And so, we've only been operating for 4.5 months or so.",1
"Got it. That's helpful. And then, Tim, if I could follow up with you, it seems like engagement with iPhones and Apple devices generally has gone up materially over the last 12 months. And I don't think replacement cycles, at least in the data we see, has shrunk or changed that much at the end of the day. I'm wondering does that combination of increased usage, replacement cycles haven't changed, end up in iPhones potentially growing on a multiyear basis, because I would imagine if I'm using something more I have to replace it more often. So, I'd love your perspective on it.",1
"We were proud to announce that we have expanded and accelerated our commitment to the U.S. economy. Over the next five years, we will invest $430 billion, creating 20,000 jobs in the process. The investments will support American innovation and drive economic benefits in every state, including a new North Carolina campus and job creating investments in innovative fields like silicon engineering and 5G technology.",1
"We're also keenly focused on how this wave of green innovation can lead to equitably shared prosperity. Through our new $200 million Restore Fund, we're helping local and rural communities around the world build sustainable industries around working for us creating opportunities and removing up to 1 million metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere every year. And here in the United States, we started a green impact accelerator, investing and supporting minority-owned businesses at the forefront of environmental fields.",1
"As Tim mentioned, given the lack of visibility and certainty in the near term, we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. However, based on what we have seen in April, and how we think things might play out, I would like to provide some additional insight on headwinds and tailwinds weâre facing.",1
"Let me answer that, Katy. First of all, on the buyback. As I said, in general, our approach to capital allocation has remained the same for the last several years and itâs not changing now. Keep in mind here, weâre talking about just the authorization, right? And when you look at our actual results at the end of every quarter, you see how much we actually do in terms of share repurchases. The $50 billion is in addition to over $40 billion that is still remaining from the past authorization that weâve received from our Board, right? So itâs the total available or outstanding in terms of authorization is over $90. And as you look at our run rate during the last several years, you know that that is a very adequate amount. And as you know, we will provide an additional update a year from now. So, nothing really has changed there. And nothing has changed on our approach for M&A. Weâve been quite active over the last several years. We purchase companies on a very regular basis. Weâre always looking for ways to accelerate our product roadmaps or fill gaps in our portfolio, both on the hardware side, on the software side, on the services side. So, we will continue to do that. And so, also on the M&A front, nothing has changed.",1
"Thank you, Tim. As a follow-up, I know youâre doing a lot with both the Apple Card and financing plan for iPhones to get your products in the hands of customers. But, I was wondering, would you consider using the strength of your balance sheet maybe a little differently, structure maybe deferred payments or things like that, or do you think that there could be other steps like bundling that you will consider versus what you already currently do? Thank you.",1
"Well, as you know, we launched the payment plan earlier on Apple Card for iPhone. Weâre working on doing that for other products as well. And youâll see something on that shortly. So, weâre very-focused on the affordability point. The trade-in programs also are fairly wide across the board and act as both something great for the environment, also something great from a way to get that entry price down. In terms of deferred payments, nothing to announce today. But, as you know, having access to the card, at least in the United States, gives us more degrees of freedom. And that is not using our balance sheet. But, we play a key role in deciding what kind of programs go with the card.",1
That will come from Morgan Stanleyâs Katy Huberty.,1
"Thank you for the question. I hope the whole team is staying healthy and safe. Tim, I want to start on a longer term question. Where do you see structural changes on the back of this health crisis that might present opportunities for new revenue streams at Apple? And Iâm particularly thinking about your past comments on health and augmented reality. But Iâm sure there is even more areas of inspiration and creativity coming out of the company. And then, I have a follow-up.",1
"I think, there are things from just a great reminder of how important our products are for remote work. And itâs pretty clear to me that where things will get a lot closer to normal than they are today, obviously. I think many people are finding that they can learn remotely. And so, I suspect that trend will accelerate some. I think thatâs probably also true about working remotely in some areas and in some jobs. And so, I think we have significant solutions and products for all of those groups. On the health area, I gave some examples in my opening comments about the ECG being used on the Watch. You can bet that weâre looking at other areas in this. We were already doing that because we viewed that that area was a huge opportunity for the Company and a way for us to help a lot of people. And so, you will see us continue on that. I wouldnât say that the health door opened wider. I would say, it was already opened fairly wide.",1
"Okay. And then, as a follow-up, the $50 billion share repurchase authorization is impressive in absolute terms, but it is a bit lower than the last couple of years. So, just any context around the thought process of landing on $50 billion. And then, related to that, you have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world. Does the current environment change your thinking at all around M&A opportunities?",1
"Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess, first off on the channel inventory. I was hoping if you could talk about how did channel inventory look like in the March quarter, because it sounds like it may be below the historical ranges. And then, the discussion you had for June quarter performance of iPhones, what are you embedding from a channel building back inventory levels in that expectation.",1
"Tim, in past downturns, we have not really seen Apple pull back from investing. And you as a company have largely maintained the product introduction cadence. But given these are unprecedented times and there are a lot of challenges associated with product development, during a time when you have a global footprint for such activities and unable to really do a lot of things in person, how should we think about the product development and introduction cadence as we go over the next several quarters? And I have a follow-up.",1
"Amit, itâs Tim. If you look at the iPhone channel inventory during Q2, the reduction of it was more than the reduction from the previous year. Itâs not unusual that we reduce in Q2. In fact, if you look back, generally speaking, in the first half of the calendar year, we reduce channel inventories; during the second half of the calendar year, we generally raise channel inventories. Thatâs a seasonal thing. And sitting here today, I believe that will happen this year as well. So, hopefully, that answers your question. And by the way, we ended in a comfortable position. You could conclude from that that we were within a target range.",1
"Thatâs really helpful. Maybe just for follow-up. Tim, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit about, how do you think about Appleâs manufacturing strategy and perhaps need for some diversity, especially given everything in the Company and everyone has gone through over the last 12 months, how do you think about that? And do you feel comfortable that the supply chain and the manufacturing base is well situated today to launch the traditional fall products that they used to get from Apple?",1
"As you know, our supply chain is global. And so, our products are truly made everywhere. And I would focus on that versus focus on one element of the manufacturing process, which tends to get more visibility, which is the final assembly. We have some final assembly in the United States; we have final assembly in China as well. I think, youâd have to conclude, or at least I conclude that if you look at the shock to the supply chain that took place this quarter, for it to come back up so quickly really demonstrates that itâs durable and resilient. And so, I feel good about where we are. That said, weâre always looking at tweaks. And itâs just not something we talk about, because if we view it as confidential and competitive information. And so, we will look at the -- as we get out of this totally, we will look to see what we learned and what we should change.",1
Weâll hear from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank,1
"Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions. So, I want to focus my question on Services. The segment was solid in the quarter despite overall macro weakness. I can kind of see the logic behind it being strong despite product weakness overall. As you kind of look at the rest of the year, do you think that sustains or at some point does the macro impacts worldwide impact the Services line?",1
"Jeriel, let me take that one. We typically donât give a lot of specifics about our categories. But Iâve said, as we look into the June quarter, we see two distinct trends in our services business overall. Our ecosystem is very strong. Our customers are very engaged. We are continuing to grow double digits, the number of transacting accounts and paid accounts. And so, we expect our digital services to continue at the same level of performance that we have seen during the March quarter. And that includes the App Store, of course, our video business, our music business, cloud services. So, we expect all these businesses to continue to grow very strongly.",1
"Well, weâre continuing to operate. And so, as you can tell, along with everything else going on, we were able to launch and ship the iPhone SE, the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard, and the MacBook Air. And so, the business continues and the new products are our lifeblood. And so, weâre continuing to work. Everybodyâs getting used to the work-at-home. In some areas of the Company, people maybe even more productive, in some other areas theyâre not as productive. And so, itâs mixed, depending upon what the roles are. But, as you can tell from what we did this quarter, despite the environment, we have our head down, are working because we know that our customers want the products that weâve got. Theyâre even more important in these times.",1
Thank you very much for that.,1
"As of this month, 110 of our suppliers have joined us in our renewable energy commitment, and we will bring online nearly 8 gigawatts of new clean energy, the equivalent of taking 3.4 million gas-powered vehicles off the road each year. Through Apple's $4.7 billion in green bonds and related efforts, we've supported transformative environmental projects around the world from clean energy initiatives in China to two of the world's largest onshore wind turbines in Denmark to 180-acre solar project outside Reno, Nevada and many more.",1
"Yes. That will come from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.",1
"On iPhone and Wearables, we expect a year-over-year revenue performance to worsen in the June quarter relative to the March quarter; on iPad and Mac, we expect the year-over-year revenue performance to improve in the June quarter.",1
"On Services, we are seeing two distinct trends. First, customers are actively engaging with our ecosystem and digital services, and we believe the very strong recent performance in the App Store, Video, Music, and cloud services will continue throughout the June quarter. Second, due to the overall reduced level of economic activity, due to the lockdowns around the world, services like AppleCare and advertising are being impacted. AppleCare is comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements with our customers, both of which have been obviously affected by store closures and reduced level of customer traffic. Advertising, which is comprised of third-party agreements, our App Store search ads, and Apple News ads has been impacted by overall economic weakness and uncertainty on when businesses will reopen.",1
"For gross margin, sequential headwinds include foreign exchange, the mix within products, and the seasonal loss of leverage on our product business. Foreign exchange will have a 70 basis points impact sequentially and 130 basis points impact year-over-year. Regarding product mix, keep in mind the commentary we provided at the revenue level. Sequential tailwinds include cost savings and the mix shift towards services.",1
"With regard to capital allocation, our approach remains unchanged. We continue to invest confidently in our future while also returning value to our shareholders. We are in the midst of developing our most exciting pipeline of products and services ever while contributing over $350 billion to the U.S. economy and expanding our footprint in many cities around the country over a five-year period.",1
"We also continue to believe that there is great value in our stock, and we are maintaining our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As a testament to the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our Board has authorized $50 billion for share repurchases in addition to the over $40 billion authorization remaining under the current share repurchase plan. Our Board has also authorized a 6% increase in our quarterly dividend and today declared a cash dividend of $0.82 per share of common stock, payable on May 14, 2020, to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2020.",1
"Finally, and most importantly, we are managing Apple for the long term, as weâve always done. During uncertain times historically, we have continued to invest in the business and this remains our philosophy. We will continue to stay focused on what we do best, investing in our product and service pipeline, managing the business wisely, and taking care of our teams and believe we will come out from this stronger.",1
"Thank you very much for taking my question, and I hope everyone is well. Tim, you talked about seeing some improvement in the second half of April. So, I was wondering if you could just talk maybe a bit more on the segment, a geographic basis, what youâre seeing and in the various regions that youâre selling in and what youâre hearing from your customers. And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.",1
"Yes. Thank you. Tim, I think I speak for everyone on the call that weâre all very appreciative of Appleâs contribution during this pandemic. We all appreciate it.",1
"Sure, Shannon. If you look at -- Iâll start with China. If you look at what happened in China, we were having a really good January. The lockdown started there toward the end of January, as you know. February, we saw a steep decline in demand. We closed our stores in February. As the lockdown completed in mid-February, toward the second half of February, we begin to open stores. We opened on a staggered basis that took about 30 days until mid-March. And from a demand point of view, we saw then an improvement in March over February. And if you look at, kind of where we are today, weâve seen further improvement in April as compared to March. And so, thatâs China.",1
"If you look at the rest of the world, we were doing great in January, the first five weeks of the quarter. And we do believe that we were headed toward the sort of the top end of our expectations that we had talked to you about on the last call. The next five weeks were spent sort of reacting and getting the supply chain back up in full force and working through the sharp decline in China that I already talked about. The real thing for the rest of the world happened in March when the shelter-in-place orders went in and the work-from-home began. For those two, three weeks period, at the end of the quarter, we saw a sharp decline in demand.",1
"If you now step out into April and look at that, early April started like the end of March, but in the second half of April, weâve seen an uptick across really across the board. Itâs not just related to a certain geo or a certain product. We think, by looking at it, a part of it is due to just our new products, a part of it is due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April, and then a part of it is probably the consumer behavior of knowing this is going to go on for a little while longer and getting some devices and so forth lined up to work at home more. In particular for as I think Luca shared, we believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year-over-year basis during this quarter, and thatâs customers that are either taking online education or working remotely. So, complex answer to your question, but thatâs what weâre seeing.",1
"Thank you. That was helpful. Luca, unless I missed it, you talked about various puts and takes in the quarter, but didnât really discuss operating expenses. I know you mentioned some cost savings on the COGS line. Iâm curious how youâre thinking about your spending and OpEx, given some of the macro challenges that you may be facing. Thank you.",1
"Yes. So, Shannon, as we said, we manage the Company for the long term, right? So, we know that the core of the business, the core of the Company is innovation and product and services development. So, we will continue to invest in our pipeline. Weâre very excited about what we have in store. And so, we will continue to invest there. Obviously, we are aware of the environment and so, we will manage the SG&A portion of the company tightly. We are making new investments in the new services that we launched recently. As you know, we purchased the baseband activities from Intel. And obviously, we want to develop that technology because we consider itâs a core technology for us. And so, we will try to balance the need to continue to invest during difficult circumstances and the fact that we like to manage the business wisely.",1
That will be from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.,1
"Given the overall economic environment, the level of demand right now, there are two businesses that we believe are going to be impacted during the June quarter. One of them is AppleCare. AppleCare is essentially comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements that we signed with our customers when they purchase our devices. Both these businesses have been affected obviously by the store closures. And not only our retail stores, but also our partners points of sale, and obviously, the reduced level of customer traffic because of the social distancing measures. Right? And we do expect AppleCare to be affected during the during the June quarter.",1
"The other business, which we think is going to be impacted by the overall economic weakness and the uncertainty on when businesses will reopen is advertising, which is the sum of our advertising business on the App Store, on Apple News, and the third party agreements that we have on the advertising front. So, these are two things that during the June quarter will create a headwind for the Services business.",1
"Got it. I appreciate that. My second question is about the overall purchasing decisions the consumers are making. So far, through April, have you seen increased perhaps downtick across your product line? So for example, somebody might have shift maybe toward the lower end of the storage mix of certain products. And do you expect that going forward, as unemployment uptick and macro impacts kind of layer on through the rest of â20? Thanks.",1
"It was a quarter of sustained strength for Wearables, Home and Accessories, which grew by 25% year-over-year. Apple Watch is a global success story, and the category set March quarter records in each geographic segment, thanks to strong performance from both Apple Watch Series 6 and Apple Watch SE.",1
I'd now like to turn over the call to Tim for introductory remarks.,1
"Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. Apple is proud to report another strong quarter, one where we set new March quarter records for both revenue and earnings, besting our year ago revenue performance by 54%.",1
"Reflecting both the enduring ways our products have helped our users meet this moment in their own lives as well as the optimism consumers seem to feel about better days ahead, we set new March quarter records in every geographic segment, and success was broadly distributed across our product categories. Mac and Services delivered all-time record results, and we set new March quarter records for iPhone and Wearables, Home and Accessories.",1
"To provide some color on our results, let's turn to our product categories. We saw a very strong performance for iPhone, which grew 66% year-over-year driven by the strong popularity of the iPhone 12 family. With unmatched 5G capability, the best camera system ever in an iPhone and advanced durability from ceramic shield, this family of devices is popular with both upgraders and new customers alike.",1
"And just last week, we unveiled an all-new purple finish for iPhone 12 and 12 Mini. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, iPad and Mac continue to be critically important tools for our customers. Over the past year, tens of millions of iPads and Macs have been deployed to help students learn, creators create, and to enhance remote work in all of its forms. This has helped iPad grow very strong double digits to its highest March quarter revenue in nearly a decade.",1
"On Mac, fueled by the M1, we set an all-time revenue record continuing the momentum for the product category. In fact, the last three quarters for Mac have been its three best quarters ever. Last week, both iPad and Mac took a big step forward. We debuted a radically redesigned brand-new iMac designed around M1's unmatched capabilities, and we've brought M1 to iPad for the first time in the new iPad Pro with 5G capability and a Liquid Retina XDR display.",1
"It's an exciting and busy period ahead for Wearables, Home and Accessories with the launch of the next-generation Apple TV 4K and our newest accessory, AirTag. AirTag builds on the powerful and incredibly useful Find My experience, helping users privately and securely keep track of the items that matter most to them. Third-party accessories and products can also make use of the Find My network guaranteeing a great experience no matter what products you choose to use.",1
"I havenât seen what youâre asking. No. I have seen a strong customer response to iPhone SE, which is our most affordable iPhone. But it appears that those customers are primarily coming from wanting a smaller form factor with the latest technology, or coming over from it from Android. So, those are the two principal kind of segments versus somebody buying down, as youâre talking about it. Weâve also seen -- we launched the iPad Pro in the midst of all of this and the reception there has also been incredibly good. And thatâs obviously our top of the line iPad. And so, Iâm not seeing what youâre alluding to, at least at this point.",1
Turning to Services. We achieved growth of 27% year-over-year and set new records for services in each of our geographic segments. We continue to enhance and improve our current service offerings from Apple Music to Apple News while continuing to launch new services that enhance our customers' lives.,1
"Just last week, we introduced Apple Card family which reinvents how you can share credit cards and build credit together. We also announced Apple Podcast subscriptions, a global marketplace for listeners to discover premium content from their favorite creators and storytellers. While we're on the topic of services, in many ways, this quarter showed the unique value to customers created by Apple's belief in the deep integration of hardware, software, and services.",1
"Across our products and throughout our software ecosystem, we continue to deploy industry-leading new tools to protect users' fundamental right to privacy. In addition to the App Store privacy nutrition labels that we discussed on last quarter's call, we're proud to have launched the full implementation of App Tracking Transparency. This powerful, yet simple idea gives users a choice over how their data is used and shared across the apps that they love and use every day.",1
"No matter what device you enjoy it from, it is a milestone period for Apple TV+, racking up many new award nominations and wins, including its first Oscar nominations. Ted Lasso, in particular, has been recognized with a multitude of awards and nominations including most recently, an AFI Program of the Year Recognition, Writers Guild of America Awards, and a clean sweep at the Critics Choice Awards.",1
"Apple TV+ also continues to be a place where we can tell stories that matter and lift up important voices and experiences like our new upcoming content partnership with Malala, our latest original documentary special The Year the Earth Changed narrated by the legendary David Attenborough and released to commemorate Earth Day. This is, of course, just one example of how Apple lives its values and operationalizes the idea that to whom much is given, much is expected.",1
"To begin with our environmental efforts, just last week, we marked a milestone Earth Day on multiple fronts. In addition to the progress we've made in our own efforts to achieve our pledge of a net zero carbon footprint by 2030 across our entire supply chain and use of our products, we're proud to play a role in the growing ripple change taking place across the private sector.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business results of operation.

"Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q2 FY 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.",1
And that does conclude todayâs conference. Thank you all for joining us today.,1
"Thank you, Chris. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. The numbers for the telephone replay are 8888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. Please enter a confirmation code 3229513. These replays will be available by approximately 5 pm Pacific Time today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414. Financial analysts can contact me with additional questions at 669-227-2402. Thank you again for joining us.",1
"Yes. For March, Chris, we saw NAND pricing increase slightly while DRAM and displays and the other commodities declined. For the June quarter, we would expect NAND and DRAM pricing to remain at this historically low level, while displays and most other commodity prices we expect to decline.",1
"Okay. As a follow-up -- the follow-up question is on commodity pricing. And I think, you had expected to see some commodity price declines through the March quarter. If you could talk about what you expect, as you go through the year, perhaps in this new environment, and again, whether that turns into a challenge or a headwind for gross margins as you go into the second half?",1
"Chris, weâve always been about delivering the best product at a good price. And that fundamental strategy has not changed at all. As you know, we did have an SE for a while. Itâs great to bring it back. It was a beloved product. And so, I wouldnât read anything into that other than we want to give people the best deal that we can while making the best product.",1
"Yes. Thank you. I wanted to follow up with another question on iPhone SE and the decision to bring it back and where it sits within the total iPhone strategy. And I guess, coupled with the fact that iPhone 11, you made the decision to bring that at a lower price point. What does that tell us with respect to your approach to iPhone pricing and flexibility? Is this helping to add users and kind of bring people into the ecosystem? And if so, what does that imply for gross margins?",1
Certainly. Our last question today will be from Chris Caso with Raymond James.,1
"I think, it plays in every geo, but I would expect to see it doing even better in areas where the median incomes are less. And so, weâll see how that plays out. And I expect some fair number of people switching over to iOS. So, itâs an unbelievable offer. Itâs, if you will, the engine of our top phones in a very affordable package. And I think -- and itâs faster than the fastest Android phones. And so, itâs an exceptional value.",1
"If I can just follow up on your previous comment about the strong demand youâre seeing for iPhone SE. Just given the price point, Iâm wondering if you are expecting any change in terms of the geographic mix of where the demand comes from relative to typically what do you see for other iPhones from the line up on, just giving the lower price point?",1
"To your question about store traffic, store traffic is obviously up from where it was in February, but it is not back to where it was pre the lockdown. There has been, however, more move to online. And as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, itâs pretty phenomenal actually. Retail had a quarterly record for us during the quarter. And thatâs despite stores being closed for the three-week period around the world. And ex China -- and then China was closed prior to that three weeks. And thatâs partly because the online store had such a phenomenal quarter, and that included in China, but it was also other regions as well. So, there is definitely a move. And whether thatâs a permanent shift, I would hesitate to go that far, because I think people like to be out and about. They just know that now is not the time to do that.",1
"Yes. What we saw in China for the full quarter -- and Iâll speak about mainland China because I think thatâs the source of your question. We saw strong results in iPad and in Wearables, and in Services. And if you look up underneath the full quarter, we saw a strong January, and then a significantly reduced demand in February as the shelter-in-place orders and the lockdowns went into effect in China and the stores closed. And then, in March, as stores reopened, the recovery began. And then, weâve seen further recovery in April. Where that goes, we will see. But thatâs kind of what weâve seen so far there.",1
"Hi. Thanks for taking my question. If I can just start with a question on kind of what youâre seeing in China. You mentioned going to the pickup in activity. But, is that driven by more kind of footfall in the stores, or whatâve you seen relative to online activity, and how much of this recovery is being driven online? Any thoughts on that, please?",1
That will be from JP Morganâs Samik Chatterjee.,1
"Thanks, Jeriel. Can we have the next question, please.",1
"Well, we don't predict a rev guide to product-level detail. We're not even guiding to the top level at this point because of COVID. And so I'll sidestep that question. But I would point to Luca's point earlier about the shortages and those shortages primarily affect iPad and Mac. So, we expect to be supply gated, not demand gated.",1
We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.,1
Congrats on a fantastic quarter. First question for Tim or Luca. The Greater China sales were very strong in the March quarter. Can you give some color on what drove this strength. Which hardware products or services enabled the solid outperformance in China. And then I had a follow-up.,1
Thanks Amit. Can we have the next question please.,1
"Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I have two as well. First of all I was hoping you just touched a little bit on the geographic growth vectors that you saw. And I think Americas grew really well 19%, 20%. But Europe and China had much more muted growth if you may. I know your compares are fairly difficult but I'm curious if anything you would call out in terms of spillover effect on the macro side from Russia, Ukraine in Europe that's seeing some impact to consumer spend or even in China. Just help us understand what happened geographically there.",1
"So Amit, as you said in the Americas, we had a very strong quarter up 19% very happy across the board there. Europe, again was a really good quarter for us. We grew 5% in spite of the fact that of course as you know during the month of March, we paused our sales in Russia. So we had an impact to our sales results there for a month of the quarter. But a number of European countries particularly in Western Europe did really-really well for us. And so it was a very good quarter for us pretty much in line with our expectations. Americas was better than our expectations. China was again a March quarter record for us. Keep in mind and this affected every geographic segment for us the different launch timing for the iPhone this year versus a year ago had an impact on the March quarter results because we launched the product later a year ago than we did this year.",1
So some of the channel fill for the new products happened during the March quarter a year ago. Japan and Asia Pacific were affected by foreign exchange. Japan would have grown in line with company average in constant currency terms. Asia Pacific as well was affected by foreign exchange with the dollar appreciating against most currencies. And then again this difference in the launch timing for the iPhone made a difference. Keep in mind again the supply constraints that we had during the quarter our results would have been obviously better without the supply constraints. Overall we felt very good about the performance around the world.,1
"If I could just follow up on the supply chain the $4 billion to $8 billion impact that you folks talked about. Do you think this is demand that's deferred out, or demand that's essentially destroyed because you have a product cycle that's going to come out in the year at some point soon this year? How do you think about demand deferred versus demand destroyed on that front? And then is there a sense of which product categories are most impacted by this versus not?",1
"It will affect most of the product categories. And in terms of whether it's -- whether we can recapture or not we believe that there's a percentage of it that is recapturable and a percentage of it that is likely not where somebody needs something quickly. And that ratio or that percentage is very difficult to estimate. We obviously, try to do that internally in order to demand plan but it's not something that we share.",1
Got it. Thank you.,1
Yes. Thank you. Good evening. Also just wanted to dig in on the supply constraints a bit. And I guess one of the things you said is that the $4 billion to $8 billion range reflects some reopening of facilities during the quarter. I know obviously it's tough to predict as you go forward into the second half of launch of new products. But at that point would you expect the constraints to still be mainly on the component side? And then hopefully if things don't get worse in China then the facilities are open and the constraints are only the component constraints as you go into the second half of the year.,1
"Thank you, Katy. Can we have a next question please.",1
Yes. Chris it's hard to answer a question about unannounced products. And so I'll try to not do that. But theâ,1
For all products yes.,1
The $4 billion to $8 billion is simply as I had mentioned that if you look at the Shanghai corridor -- we have some final assembly plants in this area. And almost all of them have restarted as the good news of it working with local officials. But we planned various ramps for these. And that's the range of 4% to 8% that we've estimated. Kobi is difficult to predict. For sure for sure.,1
As a follow-up I wanted to also follow on some of your comments regarding inflation and how Apple is dealing with it. Obviously component costs have been going up in many different areas. And then specifically in the semiconductor side costs have been going up but perhaps for some different reasons because of the additional cost of going up to new process nodes that it's higher than it has been in the past. How is Apple planning to deal with that? And is it possible for you to get through that without either raising prices on your product or affecting gross margins?,1
"Well, some of what you said is in the results for the last quarter that we've announced. And obviously we've put our current thinking in the current quarter guidance that Luca listed earlier. There are component costs that are falling and ones that are rising.",1
And so not all of them are moving in the same direction. And so we really try to manage to the net of these. And I think we're doing a reasonable job currently navigating the what is a challenging environment.,1
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.,1
Thank you. Pretty amazing how the team has navigated all the cross currents. Congrats again on the quarter.,1
"We were very pleased with our performance in China. We set a March quarter revenue record and grew strong double digits across each of the product categories. And so the revenue growth was broad. We've been especially pleased by the customer response in China to the iPhone 12 family. And as I had mentioned earlier, you have to remember that China entered the shutdown phase earlier in Q2 of last year than other countries. And so they were relatively more affected in that quarter, and that has to be taken into account as you look at the results.",1
Absolutely. We'll take our first question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today our Board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases, as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral, overtime. We're also raising our dividend by 5% to $0.23 a share and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward.",1
"As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near-term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights, based on the assumption that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.",1
We believe our year-over-year revenue performance during the June quarter will be impacted by a number of factors. Supply constraints caused by COVID-related disruptions and industry-wide silicon shortages are impacting our ability to meet customer demand for our products. We expect these constraints to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion which is substantially larger than what we experienced during the March quarter.,1
"The COVID-related disruptions are also having some impact on customer demand in China. With respect to foreign exchange, we expect it to be a nearly 300 basis point headwind to our year-over-year growth rate. Additionally, we paused, all sales in Russia during the March quarter. This will impact our year-over-year growth rate by approximately 150 basis points.",1
"Specifically related to Services, we expect to continue to grow double-digits, but decelerate from our March quarter performance, due to some of the factors I just described. We expect gross margin to be between 42% and 43%. We expect OpEx to be between $12.7 billion and $12.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $100 million excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%.",1
"Finally, reflecting the dividend increase I mentioned earlier, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on May 12th 2022 to shareholders of record as of May 9th, 2022.",1
"Yes. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. A couple of macro-related questions, just given everything that's going on in the market, the first is on how you're thinking about consumer spending, as we see more stock market volatility, rising interest rates, inflation.",1
"But looking ahead, we see two causes of supply constraints. One is the COVID-related disruptions; and there's the industry-wide silicon shortages that will continue. We've estimated the constraints to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion. And if you â these constraints are primarily centered around the Shanghai corridor. And the â on a positive front, almost all of the affected final assembly factories have now restarted. And so the range â the $4 billion to $8 billion range reflects various ramps of getting back up and running. We're also encouraged that the COVID case count that's been reported in Shanghai has decreased over the last few days. And so there's â there's some reason for optimism there.",1
"What metrics are you watching either internal to your business or external at the macro level to understand whether you'll ultimately start to see some demand impact particularly on the product side of your business? And then, I have a follow-up.",1
"Katy, hi, it's Tim. We're obviously monitoring our daily sales very closely. From an inflation point of view, we are seeing inflation. It is or was evident in our gross margin last quarter and in our OpEx last quarter and it is assumed in the guidance that Luca gave for this quarter as well. So we're definitely seeing some level of inflation that I think everybody is seeing.",1
And how are â just as a follow-up to that how are you thinking about how that might impact the consumers in your business and whether it influences their ability to purchase at the same level?,1
Well we're monitoring that closely and we've sort of â but right now our main focus frankly speaking is on the supply side.,1
"Okay. And as it relates to that in China, how should we think about lockdowns from an impact on supply and an impact on demand? And what products in your portfolio should we expect to be most impacted? Thank you.",1
"Yes. Good question. For Q2 so the quarter that we just finished, the restrictions in China had not started yet. And so Q2, we did have supply constraints. They were significantly lower than what we had experienced during the December quarter. They were driven by industry-wide silicon shortages. And specifically, the issue that I talked about on previous calls with the legacy nodes.",1
Thanks Chris. Can we have the next question please?,1
Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS.,1
Great. Thank you guys for taking my question. I just want to dig in a little bit on the product disruption the $4 billion to $8 billion. In the past you kind of gave us a sense for how it would affect each different product lines. And should we expect it to have similar pro rata impacts? And is there an opportunity to maybe reallocate resources to limit maybe some of the impact on the iPhone line and then maybe versus the iPad line? And then I have a quick follow-up.,1
"Got it. Got it. Very helpful. And then as a quick follow-up with the shutdowns, especially in places like China, have you seen actually the App Stores or your Services business actually inflect positively, or is it too short a time frame to make a judgment call on that?",1
"The second thing is that the level of engagement that we see on our platform continues to grow. We have more transacting accounts, more paying accounts, more accounts with subscriptions. The absolute amount of paid subscriptions on our platform is pretty impressive 825 million. It's an increase of 165 million in the last 12 months alone. So you can tell that this is great growth. And of course, as you've seen over the last few years, we've added a lot of new services and we plan to add new services and new features that we believe that our customers would love. And so we think that's a great -- absolute great momentum.",1
"The growth rates can change a bit, especially during COVID because we've gone through some cycles of lockdowns and then reopenings and so on. And so sometimes the comps can be a bit deceiving. We are looking at it from the lens of continuing to satisfy our customers, adding to the portfolio, improving the quality of the services and that has served us very well, because in the last 12 months, we've generated $75 billion of Services revenue. And you've seen the margins are obviously accretive to company margin. So we feel good, we feel good about the Services business.",1
"I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the growth rate for the June quarter, we expect it to be less than the 17% that we've reported in March for some of the reasons that I described. Of course, foreign exchange is an issue with the dollar being strong at this point. And of course we paused, our sales in Russia. So we need to take that into account. But in general, when we look across the board, we set all-time records and quarterly records for each one of our categories.",1
"Thanks, Samik. Can we have the next question please.",1
"Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the really strong results. I have two questions too and I do apologize. The first one is on supply constraints. Luca, if I tried to read the deal based on June quarter guidance revenue is being impacted kind of implies year-over-year down revenue. And you also spoke about a $4 billion to $8 billion supply constraint which is a large amount compared to the revenue. And I understand you have the supply constraints and the China shutdowns. I'm just kind of curious, do you think the last three quarters Apple supply chain had a better buffer inventory of semis that kind of got used up and now you're kind of more tied to whatever the true supply contains of legacy semis, or is there something else going on? And then I had a follow-up.",1
"What has happened obviously during COVID has change over the quarters. Recently, for example during the March quarter, the constraints that we had were limited to silicon shortages. When we are giving out this range of $4 billion to $8 billion, it's not only silicon but it's the restrictions in China that we're seeing right now. So they are different. There's additional constraints at this point that we are seeing because of the COVID situation. So it's -- that is the fundamental difference there.",1
"Yes, I think, it's early to tell. The restrictions in China started at the very end of March. So, it's very, very early to tell.",1
It will affect most of the product categories. And we obviously will look to do any kind of optimization that we can do to minimize the effect on the user.,1
Got it. Got it. Thank you Luca. Thank you very much.,1
"Yes. Thank you. Luca, thanks for the color around the impacts to the revenue guidance. But I was wondering if you could share a if you expect to grow overall revenue in the June quarter on a year-on-year basis. And just to be clear on these impacts that you gave those are on a year-on-year basis. Can you also tell us how much FX is a headwind if any on a quarter-on-quarter basis and incremental Russia impact quarter-on-quarter basis and incremental supply chain impact also on a quarter-on-quarter basis? And I have a follow-up.",1
"Well, as we said, we're not guiding to a specific revenue number. And -- but just to repeat what I said during the prepared remarks, we're having supply constraints that are caused by the COVID-related disruptions and by the silicon shortages. And that is what is creating the constraints.",1
"We expect them to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion. This is substantially larger than what we've had during the March quarter. Again, let me repeat the COVID-related disruptions did not affect the March quarter. So you need to keep that in mind.",1
"With respect to foreign exchange, we expect it to be nearly 300 basis points headwind. It was about 200 basis points headwind during the March quarter. For Russia, we said that the impact on a year-over-year basis is approximately 150 basis points, that reflects the three months of the quarter. We paused sales in Russia at the beginning of March. So it was a partial impact on the March quarter.",1
"So, obviously, on a sequential basis, it's an incremental factor to keep in mind. I would say on the positive side here is that the demand for both our products and services is solid. Tim has mentioned a number of times the iPhone 13 family is having a really strong year. We -- when we look at top-selling smartphones around the world, we've had pretty incredible results during the March quarter. The top six models in the United States are iPhones, the top four in Japan, the top five in Australia, five of the top six in urban China and so on and so forth. So the iPhone 13 has been truly a global success.",1
"Well we feel really great about the momentum for our Services business. I was looking at the absolute numbers here. This run rate of almost $20 billion is essentially double what we had just four years ago. So we've done really, really well with Services. We have a lot of momentum for a variety of reasons. The first one is the fact that our installed base of active devices continues to grow very nicely. And so that is obviously a big engine for our Services business.",1
"And my follow-up for Luca. Luca we are seeing sort of a settling in terms of growth rate for the Services business on the tough comps that you have. We're also seeing the gross margins there settling around this sort of 72% range. And I understand there are a lot of moving pieces beneath that. But is this sort of a good range for Services longer term, or are there sort of moving pieces there that as they scale they can take â there is an opportunity for more upside?",1
"Yeah. We don't get to that level of granularity because we view it to be sensitive data that our competitors would love to have. And so I'm going to punt on answering that question. I would just say that, when you zoom out and look at iPhone, as a total we could not be happier with the iPhone 13 family of products and the strength we've seen for this cycle. And really, it's those products that have powered the line and given us the overall results that we've had on iPhone, which for the first half the revenues were $120 billion and we feel very, very good about those results.",1
"Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results as well. I'll stick to two more micro level questions here. Firstly, Tim you talked about the iPhone SE three demand that you the product that you just launched. I was hoping you could compare what you're seeing in terms of momentum to previous iPhone SE cycles? Particularly I think in the past North America has been the largest region in terms of demand what are you seeing with the current product in terms of demand by geography? And I have a quick follow-up for Luca? Thank you.",1
"Thanks, Jim. Can we have the next question, please.",1
Thank you. And congratulations to you and your entire team.,1
"Yeah. I wouldn't â you're talking about for the silicon shortage in particular I assume. I don't want to predict that, because the â that entails knowing how worldwide demand and supply are for the whole â for industries outside of even the industry we're in. And I don't proclaim to be an expert in that. That also heavily is influenced by how strong the economies are in the different markets. And so I think there are varying levels of outcomes. And what we're focused on is doing â trying to do very well regardless of how that question is answered.",1
"And then my quick follow-up. We've been talking about supply chain issues for multiple quarters now. Are you kind of hearing from your suppliers that maybe later half of this year, or is it actually going to go into kind of 2013 for some closer equilibrium time period?",1
"And so you want to work on cycle times and so forth to do things very quickly and take strategic inventory in places where you need to buffer for interruptions and so forth. And so we're constantly thinking about where those places are. In today's world it's not really possible for us to have buffer on silicon. And so, today silicon rolls off the fab and it's into a final assembly plant very, very quickly and we try to make that as short a time as possible.",1
"And I think we've done a really good job of managing through the COVID piece of it. And so -- but we are learning and we're making some changes as we go, we don't have a tenure. And so, to the degree that we learn something that we should change, you can bet that we're doing that. In this business you don't want to hold a ton of inventory.",1
"But when you back up and kind of zoom out and look to see how the supply chain has done within the environment that you eloquently talked about, I think it's been very resilient with -- the top issue we've had clearly is the silicon shortage that I think everybody is struggling with.",1
"Well, I'm looking forward to that day as I know all of you are. Our supply chain is truly global. And so the products are made everywhere. And we do a lot in the U.S. We'll probably be doing even more here as more chips are produced here. And we continue to look at optimizing. We learn something every day and make changes.",1
"Or do you actually consider like holding more buffer inventory internally, because right now letting $4 billion to $8 billion go away it'd be nice to have that to be able to sell. So do you consider holding more buffer inventory or maybe even doing your own chips by outsourcing your own chips to control them more, or how should we think about strategically when hopefully the world is in a better place from today?",1
"Thank you. Tim and your entire company has done a great job at navigating through all the issues in the past several years whether it be COVID, power outages, trade wars, shipping challenges and all that. When we hopefully someday get past all of these and the supply constraints in society and turmoil hopefully across the world, do you start to reconsider the way you do the supply chain albeit just-in-time ordering and outsourcing so much of your chips?",1
"Thanks, David. Can we have the next question please?",1
"We were happy with the iPhone growth last quarter, particularly when you think about the comp that it was going against because we had very different timing on the launches in the year ago quarter where we launched in Q1. And therefore naturally Q2 is at a different place on the new product curve. And so, it was a very difficult comp. And so we were pleased with it. And as Luca said, the Americas geography did quite well last quarter. And the US, of course, is the major geography within there. And so the US was quite strong last quarter.",1
Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up. You talked about potential COVID-related demand issues in China and taking at 150 basis points from Russia. But when you look at the other geographies is there anything that you can share with us whether it's in Western Europe or the US that you're seeing from a demand perspective that may be sort of out of the ordinary or outside of sort of the disruptions and the lack of product demand seems to be sort of where you would think it would be at this point in the cycle. Thank you.,1
"We returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, during the March quarter. This included $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $22.9 billion through open market repurchases of 137 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 5 million shares in the final settlement of our 18th ASR.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. As we continue to generate very strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with $193 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3.8 billion in maturing debt, while increasing commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion. As a result, net cash was $73 billion at the end of the quarter.",1
"We also unveiled the general availability of Apple Business Essentials in the US, adding a new subscription services designed to help small businesses manage every aspect of their Apple device life cycle.",1
"Thank you. That does conclude today's Apple Q2 FY 2021 Earnings Conference Call. We thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",1
"If you remember, we announced back in 2018 that we were making a very sizable commitment to the United States. We -- at the time we announced $350 billion of investment over the following five years. And during these three years, since then, we've overachieved on those commitments, and we felt it was the right time to update these type of investments. And they span from, obviously, the investment that we made directly at Apple.",1
"For example, we talked about the creation of 20,000 new jobs at Apple over the next five years in the United States. And of course, our business has grown. And so our commitment, for example, to U.S. suppliers grows over time, and that shows in the higher numbers. In the meantime, we've got into new businesses, for example, Apple TV+, a lot of the content that we developed for our TV service is produced here in the United States. And so that's additional investment here in the United States.",1
"From an OpEx standpoint, I think as you've seen this year, we're getting a lot of leverage. This is one of those years we said many times, sometimes our OpEx grows faster than revenue, and there are some other cycles where the opposite happens. We are growing revenue this year much faster than our OpEx increase. But we want to continue to make all the necessary investments into the business. We will never under invest in our business. And so you will continue to see the fact that we -- we will continue to grow our operating expenses, particularly on the R&D side, which continues to be the core of the Company.",1
"Thank you, Samik. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcast as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

Thank you again for joining us.,1
"Good day and welcome to the Apple Q2 FY 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please, go ahead.",1
"Last month we announced another breakthrough with M1 Ultra, the world's most powerful chip for a personal computer. The incredible customer response to our M1-powered Macs helped propel a 15% year-over-year increase in revenue, despite supply constraints.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that we'll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during today's discussion will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual Report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Apple is proud to report another record quarter, with a March quarter revenue record of $97.3 billion, up 9% from a year ago and better than we anticipated. iPhone, Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories had their best ever March quarter and Services set an all-time record on the strength of subscription growth over the past year.",1
"Before I get into details, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Ukraine. We're continuing to do everything we can to support our teams in the region and we are donating to humanitarian efforts on the ground. We've also committed to donating products to support refugees arriving here in the United States.",1
"I also want to speak to the unpredictable nature of the pandemic. We are excited to be welcoming employees back to the offices in the US and Europe. At the same time, we are monitoring COVID-related disruptions in China. Our thoughts are with all those in the path of the virus and we remain as committed as ever to doing our part to help protect people and their communities.",1
"These times remind us that we cannot know what the future may hold. But they remind us too, that technology infused with humanity makes a real difference in the world. And that's where our focus has remained, on driving the innovations that can enrich people's lives.",1
"Okay. Got it. And just a quick follow-up for you, Luca. I think overall, just wanted to understand the implication of the investment plans that you announced recently for the U.S., the $430 billion over a multiyear period, getting some questions from investors of how to think about the implication on the run rate of operating expenses for the Company.",1
"Keep in mind that our Europe segment is a very broad version of Europe because it includes Western Europe, which has done very, very well. And then Eastern Europe and it goes into the Middle East. Even India is part of Europe. And those emerging markets have done incredibly well, significantly better than company average. So very, very pleased with some of the results in India, for example, Russia, Middle East in general. So it's been very broad, both across product categories and across countries in Europe.",1
"Again, obviously, Europe has been affected by lockdowns. More than most parts of the world, the lockdowns have lasted longer than here in the United States, for example. Tim was mentioning there are places in Europe still today where our stores are closed. And fortunately, we have a very strong online business that has really helped us. But working from home, learning from home, limited entertainment options, that has all played in our favor.",1
"Samik, I'll take that one. You're right. I mean we had great performance in Europe. We grew 56% during the quarter. And it was probably one of the geos where we actually saw results that were better than even our own expectations. We grew very strong double digits across the board, every product category. Particularly, I would say, iPad and Mac, they really was very, very strong.",1
"I have a couple and just wanted to get into the performance by geography here a bit, and Europe really exceptional results, particularly for this time of the year. Tim, I know you mentioned some of the 5G iPhone upgrades are in front of you, and I would assume Europe is kind of in that category. But curious to hear or maybe if you can double-click on what's driving the exceptional growth here in Europe, and like are consumers moving to 5G phones even though some of the service provider plans are not rolled out? Or are we still expecting that to be much more in front of us?",1
We'll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan.,1
"I don't even know the answer to that. It's not something that we would have predicted beforehand. And frankly, even if it's very low of people that don't want to be tracked, it's worth doing because of the -- those people should have the -- should make their own mind up, whether they would like to be tracked or not.",1
"Maybe just as a quick follow-up, Tim. Can you kind of discuss any sort of -- what the downloads have looked like. I know it just rolled out earlier this week and sort of the acceptance by the consumer at this point. Any sort of metrics that you can share with us, whether it's sort of an opt-in or opt-out sort of view from the consumer perspective?",1
"Our ATT's focus is really on the user and giving the user the ability to make a decision about whether they want to be tracked or not. And so it's putting the user in the control. Not Apple, not another company, but the user of where it should be. And so that's really the focus of it. And the feedback that we've gotten from users, both before it went live when it was in the planning stages and so forth and after, has been tremendous. And so we're really standing up on behalf of the consumer here.",1
"Congratulations on a great quarter. Maybe if I could just ask a question. I know it's early days, but any commentary color from maybe the developer community on App track -- on ATT and kind of what the initial feedback and data might look like that you could share with us?",1
We'll take our next question from David Vogt from UBS.,1
"I think we get a lot of benefit from our stores when they're open and are fully operational. And we're in better shape for parts of Q2 than we were previously, but we're still operating with a limited operational model in many stores and there's still some stores today that are closed like stores in Michigan and stores in France and so forth. And so I think it will take some amount of time, but my view would be as the stores get back up to speed, fully up to speed, we should be able to increase some of the accessory sales. Although I think we're doing fairly well at the moment. So it's not something that we're not doing well. Online has been much more beneficial and much more productive than we would have guessed going into this.",1
"One of the things we've been positive about is how growing iPhone sales can pull along Watch and AirPods sales as well as customers shop the whole store. But you mentioned through COVID that accessories do much better in a physical store environment, and that's been hard due to the shutdowns, obviously. So my question is, have you seen any improvement in the attach rate for Watch and AirPods with iPhone? And can it get a lot better from here as the environment gets closer to normalization?",1
"So that was an example of moving with the times, and we've gotten a great, great reception to that. And so we continue to learn, and I think it's very important that we're very clear about why we do what we do. The idea behind curating the App Store in order to get the privacy and security that our customers want, I think is very important, and we have to convey that in a very straightforward manner.",1
"I think with the regulatory questions and scrutiny, we have to make sure that we're telling our story and why we do what we do, and we're very focused on doing that. If we feel that more disclosure would help, we would obviously move in that direction. The App Store and other parts of Apple are not cast in concrete. And so we can move and are flexible with the times. For example, in the App Store, as you know, just a couple of quarters ago, we lowered the commission rate for small developers to 15%.",1
"All right. That was very helpful, Tim. And then maybe as a follow-up, I kind of have like a big picture philosophical question, and to the extent you can answer this. One of the concerns many investors have is about the overhang of regulatory risk. I understand it's very hard to handicap that. But I'm kind of curious do you think giving more public disclosure on your Services business like App Store would help alleviate some of those concerns? Or do you think that's revealing a lot of competitive details. But kind of curious to know what you think on services disclosure.",1
"As I mentioned earlier, we had the top two selling smartphones in urban China, so we're very proud of that. And iPad, Mac both had enormously positive quarters with great strength across the board. And we're seeing a strong reception to the new iPad Pro as a well that we just announced. A lot of great comments and about 2/3 of the people buying Mac and iPad were buying them for the first time. And so we're attracting some new customers in China, which is really important to us.",1
"Throughout the quarter, Apple continued its streak of unparalleled innovation at an unmatched pace. With Apple Silicon our teams are pushing the limits of what we once thought possible and we are seeing leaps and bounds in performance and efficiency.",1
"We now have our most powerful Mac lineup ever, with the addition of the entirely new Mac Studio. Paired with the new studio display, a 5K resolution display equipped with its own A13 Bionic chip, this new desktop and display transform any workspace into a creative powerhouse.",1
"Also, last month, the Western Australia Police Force completed the world's first commercial deployment of CarPlay across their entire fleet of vehicles, to complement the iPhone 13 issued to each officer. This allows officers to access critical information faster on the road and enhance public safety for the community.",1
"For Mac, revenue of $10.4 billion was a March quarter record despite supply constraints with 15% year-over-year growth, driven by strong demand for our M1-powered MacBook Pro. As Tim mentioned earlier, our continued innovation and investment in Apple Silicon has clearly shown in our Mac results as the last seven quarters have been the best seven quarter ever for Mac.",1
"Thank you, Tim and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to report very strong financial results for the March quarter during which we set a revenue record of $97.3 billion, up 9% year-over-year. We also set new March quarter records in the Americas, in Europe and in Greater China.",1
"On the product side, revenue was $77.5 billion, up 7% over a year ago and a March quarter record. We grew in each of our product categories except iPad, which remains significantly supply constrained throughout the quarter. And we set March quarter records for iPhone, Mac and Wearables Home and Accessories.",1
"This level of sales performance combined with unmatched customer satisfaction and loyalty, helped our installed base of active devices, reach an all-time high for all major product categories, as well as geographic segments. Our Services set an all-time revenue record of $19.8 billion, up 17% over a year ago, with March quarter records in every geographic segment and services category.",1
"Company gross margin was 43.7%, down 10 basis points from last quarter. A seasonal loss of leverage and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 36.4%, down 200 basis points sequentially, mainly driven by seasonal loss of leverage and FX. Services gross margin was 72.6%, up 20 basis points sequentially due to a different mix.",1
"Operating cash flow of $28.2 billion, net income of $25 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.52 were all March quarter records. These strong March quarter results capped a record first half of the fiscal year in the midst of a challenging macroeconomic environment. We generated over $220 billion in revenue growing 10% year-over-year and set all-time records for iPhone, Mac, Wearables Home and Accessories and Services. These record sales results drove strong double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share.",1
"Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories during the March quarter. iPhone revenue grew 5% year-over-year to a March quarter record of $50.6 billion despite supply constraints. Thanks to our continued strong customer response to our iPhone 13 family and the launch of our new iPhone SE. We set March quarter records in both developed and emerging markets and the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for the iPhone 13 family. As a result of this level of sales performance combined with unmatched customer loyalty, the iPhone active installed base reached a new all-time high across all geographies.",1
"Our investment focus on Mac has also helped drive significant activity in our growing installed base. In fact, we had a March quarter record for upgraders, while at the same time, nearly half of the customers purchasing Mac were new to the product. iPad revenue was $7.6 billion, down 2% year-over-year due to continued supply constraints. Customer response to our iPad lineup including our new M1-powered iPad Air, remains very strong and our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high during the quarter, with over half of the customers purchasing an iPad during the quarter being new to the product.",1
"As we release the groundbreaking M1 Ultra, we also expanded our iPhone offerings adding two beautiful green finishes to the iPhone 13 lineup and introducing the new 5G-enabled iPhone SE, which is great for our existing users who want a smaller iPhone and a great value for people buying an iPhone for the first time.",1
"Wearables, Home and Accessories set a March quarter record of $8.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year. And we set March quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets. In particular, our Wearables business has doubled in three years and is mainly the size of a Fortune 100 business, as we continue to attract many customers who are new to Wearables. For instance, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.",1
"Turning to Services. As I mentioned we reached an all-time revenue record of $19.8 billion, up 17%, with all-time records for the App Store, Music, Cloud Services and Apple Care and March quarter records for video, advertising and payment services.",1
"These impressive results reflect the impact of our continued investment in improving and expanding our Services portfolio and the positive momentum that we're seeing on many fronts. First, our installed base has continued to grow, reaching an all-time high across each geographic segment and major product category.",1
"Next, we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Our transacting accounts, paid accounts and accounts with paid subscriptions, all reached all-time highs during the March quarter in every geographic segment.",1
"Also, paid subscriptions continued to show very strong growth. We now have more than 825 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 165 million during the last 12 months alone. And finally, as Tim highlighted before, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current service offerings while launching new services.",1
"In the enterprise market, many businesses and government organizations continue to turn to Apple for the latest technologies, to deliver innovative services to customers and employees. In March, Alaska Airlines began to replace the conventional airport self-service kiosks with iPad Pros for faster passenger check-in and self bag drop.",1
With that I'll turn it over to Luca.,1
"We are not immune to these challenges, but we have great confidence in our teams, in our products and services and in our strategy. Fundamentally our work is about making technology that enriches people's lives and unlocks the full creative potential of humanity. And though the twists and turns of the future may be uncertain what is certain is that we will never stop striving to be a force for good in the world in everything we do and everything we are.",1
"And through our Racial Equity and Justice initiative, we're continuing to advance our work to support underrepresented communities and help build a more just and equitable world. Before I hand it over to Luca, I want to acknowledge the challenges we are seeing from supply chain disruptions driven by both COVID and silicon shortages to the devastation from the war in Ukraine.",1
Last month we published an update on the progress we've made with inclusion and diversity at Apple. We've hired more women than ever into leadership roles. And in the US nearly 60% of all leadership openings were filled by people from underrepresented communities in 2021. We also recently announced a $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund that will help workers in our supply chain discover additional educational opportunities and build new skills.,1
"And we were pleased to announce recently that we've nearly doubled the number of our top suppliers who have committed to accelerating the transition to clean energy. We are also investing in renewable energy projects in communities most impacted by climate change around the world. As we do our part to protect our planet, we're also prioritizing people. As part of our long-standing commitment to inclusion and diversity, we're continuing to build a better, stronger Apple, rooted in a culture where everyone belongs.",1
"I'd like to thank our team members working in Apple stores, customer care centers, channel partner stores and our Apple Care teams for bringing customers the best of Apple. As we look to the environment, we are making good progress on our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality across our products and supply chain by 2030. Through our Green Bonds program, we're investing in breakthrough technologies like low-carbon aluminum which we will be integrating into the new iPhone SE.",1
"To meet the needs of customers wherever they are, our Apple retail teams are constantly adapting to better serve them. We opened a new store in the United Arab Emirates this quarter at a unique waterfront location with panoramic views of the Abu Dhabi skyline. And earlier this month we opened a new store in Korea, our third and largest store in the heart of Seoul. And across the US we marked the return of in-person today at Apple Sessions with a special program featuring music from pop icon Lady Gaga.",1
"As our products and services entertain customers and help them stay healthy, we're also working to make their lives easier. Arizona for example is the first state to enable its citizens to securely add their driver's license and state IDs to Apple Wallet. More states in the territory of Puerto Rico will soon follow. We've also announced plans to introduce Tap to Pay on iPhone a simple and secure way for businesses to accept contactless payments launching across the US later this year.",1
"Fitness+ is helping users channel their inner athlete with a range of workout routines for any fitness level. We recently introduced a postpartum routine designed by mothers for mothers. And with our Apple heart and movement study, we are helping researchers glean new insights into cardiovascular fitness.",1
"In a little over two years Apple TV+ shows and movies have earned over 240 awards and more than 960 nominations from Severance to WeCrashed to Pachinko new Apple originals are connecting with audiences and earning praise from critics. We're also winning over sports fans with Friday Night Baseball, which debuted earlier this month and They Call Me Magic, a four-part documentary that premiered last week tracing the life of the iconic Magic Johnson.",1
We were especially excited to cheer on CODA as it won the Academy Award for Best Picture making Apple TV+ the first streaming service to win in this category. We were honored to be stewards of this incredibly powerful deeply moving film.,1
These principles are reflected in all of the services we've developed which continue to generate incredible enthusiasm from our customers. Services revenue rose to $19.8 billion in the March quarter reflecting a 17% increase from a year ago.,1
"The seamless integration of hardware software and services is at the center of our work and philosophy at Apple. Apple Services are designed to be easy to use with expert curation that brings our users compelling content from talented developers, creators, storytellers and artists.",1
"The rich sound, beautiful colors and compact design of HomePod mini continue to make it a hit with customers. And there's still no better companion to Apple Music than AirPods with spatial audio that transforms the way we listen putting our customers right in the center of the music.",1
"Turning to Wearables Home and Accessories, we are pleased to see these products continue to delight our users growing 12% year-over-year. Customers are enthusiastically taking charge of their health with Apple Watch Series 7 and Apple Watch SE.",1
"And with the all-new iPad Air supercharged by M1, iPad brings more power and more versatility across the entire iPad lineup. For customers around the world, iPad continues to be essential for education, creativity and entertainment. That's why we're continuing to see such a strong demand for iPad even while navigating the significant supply constraint we predicted at the start of the quarter.",1
"They love how much power and performance we've injected into such an affordable device and rave about its incredible camera and its lightning fast speeds. In the March quarter, iPhone revenue grew 5% over the previous year despite a challenging compare as we saw strong demand from our customers for the iPhone 13 family.",1
"From a foreign exchange standpoint, the U.S. dollar has appreciated recently against most currencies around the world. And as a result, we expect our revenue to be negatively impacted by more than $1.5 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our global supply chain is back, up and running. We are in a typical supply position, including our usual ramp associated with new products recently launched. These newly launched products, iPad Pro, MacBook Air, and iPhone SE have all received outstanding customer response, even during these extreme circumstances.",1
"Finally, as we move ahead into the June quarter, Iâd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"In March, we also released iOS 11.3, a major update offering new immersive augmented reality experiences, access to personal health records in the Health app and more. Apps can now deliver AR experiences that use vertical walls and doors in addition to tables and chairs and can make â more accurately map irregular shaped surfaces. The update to ARKit that made this possible came just six months after we launched the world's largest AR platform.",1
I think we've done a pretty remarkable job during the last several years at managing all these different variables and coming out with a level of gross margins that we think is really good for investors and certainly it is our plan to continue to manage them that way. But it's very difficult for me to give you a prediction of where gross margins are going to be six months or 12 months from now.,1
"In terms of the iPhone itself, even though we sell quite a few phones across the course of a year, our market share globally is low compared to the â our sales are low compared to the full market of smartphones. And so our task is to convince people that currently â or have another type of phone to switch, while really taking care of people that have an iPhone so that they choose â when they elect to buy another phone, that they buy another iPhone. And so we've spent quite a bit of time on that, as you might guess.",1
"I do think that India, India is the third largest smartphone market in the world. There's obviously huge opportunities there for us, and we have extremely low share in that market overall. And so we're putting a lot of energy there and working with the carriers in that market, and they're investing enormously on the LTE networks. And the infrastructure has come quite a ways since we began to put a lot of energy in there because of their leadership and so forth.",1
"And so I do think â I don't buy the view that market's saturated. I don't see that from a market point of view or â and certainly not from an iPhone point of view. I think the smartphone market is sort of like the best market for a consumer product company in the history of the world and â but that's how I feel about it. It's a terrific market, and we're very happy to be a part of it.",1
"Jim, on the gross margin side, I think I'll repeat what I said earlier, but you're right. Our services business, and I've said it in the past, is accretive to company margins. And so as we are able to grow the services business, that should provide a positive, a tailwind. At the same time, within the services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services that we're going to be selling.",1
"At a macro level, because about two-thirds of our company is outside the United States, a weak dollar is a positive for our gross margins; a strong dollar, as it's been during the last four years, has been a bit of a headwind for the company. We try to make it more stable through the hedging program.",1
"And in general, when we look at our process to innovate our products, typically when we launch a new product, that product tends to have a higher cost structure than the product it replaces. And so that is something that we need to work through every time we launch a new product and we have a pretty good track record and history of taking those cost structures down over time. So we need to balance all these different elements.",1
Thank you for the details and congratulations.,1
"Yeah, Jim, thanks for the question. In terms of the â let me address the smartphone market a bit and then I'll mention iPhone.",1
"A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcast, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and please enter confirmation code 5253762. These replays will be available by approximately 5:00 PM Pacific Time today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414. Financial analysts can contact Matt Blake or me with additional questions.

"Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's presentation. We do thank everyone for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",1
"Good day, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.",1
"Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This has been an exciting and productive quarter for Apple. In my letter to investors at the beginning of January, I wrote that one of Apple's great strengths is our culture of flexibility, adaptability, and creativity. This quarter featured some important announcements that speak to the power of our commitment to innovation and long-term thinking. I'd like to start with some top-line highlights and then move into greater detail with you.",1
"I'll get started with financial results. Our revenue was $58 billion toward the high end of our guidance range. We see this result as a positive outcome in light of ongoing headwinds from weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. In constant currency, our year-over-year revenue performance would have been 200 basis points better than our reported results indicate.",1
"We had great results in a number of areas across our business. It was our best quarter ever for Services with revenue reaching $11.5 billion. We had a blockbuster quarter for iPad, with revenue up 22% from a year ago. This is our highest iPad revenue growth rate in six years. And it was another sensational quarter for Wearables with growth near 50%. This business is now about the size of a Fortune 200 company, an amazing statistic when you consider it's only been four years since we delivered the very first Apple Watch. I'll talk more about these categories later.",1
"In terms of the market in general, if you look at last year, which is the last data point we have on the full market, there were still 0.5 billion feature phones sold in the world. And so many of those were sold into emerging markets, not all of them, but many of them. And we still believe that over time every phone sold will be a smartphone. And so it seems to us that with that many feature phones being sold, that's a pretty big opportunity.",1
"And then, Luca, on the question for you, is about the gross margin. When we think about if component prices start to stabilize, seeing how Apple services have been so successful and accretive to margins, should we start to look for some potential margin, gross margin upside, again should components stabilize? Thank you, gentlemen.",1
"Yeah, good question. Let me start with India, and then I'll talk more about China. India, we set a new first-half record. So we continue to put great energy there and try to â our objective over time is to go in there with all of our different initiatives from retail and everything else. And so we're working toward those things. It's a huge market and it's clear that many people will be moving into the middle class over time, as we've seen in other countries.",1
"We were surprised somewhat that through all of this period of time that the iPhone X winds up at the most selling, most popular for every week of the time since the launch. And so that's I think a powerful point. And it's number one in China, which is another powerful point. And so obviously at some point if those technologies move to lower price points and that there's probably more unit demand. But the way we think about it is trying to price a reasonable price for the value that we deliver and I feel that we did that.",1
"On the market side, we've seen iPhone X, as I had mentioned before, as being the top selling smartphone during the quarter. We gained share during the quarter. I read some notes here and there about the market itself not being good. I think on any kind of, on a 90-day clock, lots of different things can happen. But my own personal view of China is that it's a great market, and we are certainly looking far beyond 90 days and feel very bullish on the opportunity and the environment there.",1
I would say that the market for us is more than iPhone. The Mac gained share there as well. The Watch is getting some traction there. Services is doing extremely well. And so it has several catalysts and I'm very pleased with the results that we were able to show during the quarter.,1
"Thanks, Brian. Could we have the next question, please?",1
Next we'll hear from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.,1
"Thank you. Good afternoon. Tim, can you comment on the price elasticity of demand at the high end for iPhones, if that was in line with your expectations? Do you have a preference for unit growth versus ASP growth when it comes to maximizing that gross profit dollar growth? And I have a follow-up for Luca, please.",1
"We price for the value that we're delivering, and iPhone X is the most innovative product on the market. And I've said a few times, we have there sort of jam-packed with technologies that really set up the smartphone for the next decade. And so that's how we priced it.",1
"Thank you, Tim. And, Luca, your gross margins have been very robust despite the headwinds that you absorbed on commodities, which you quantified, and frankly, also from the FX hedges that are limiting somewhat the FX upside that a lot of other companies are seeing. So as you, one, when do you expect these to turn into tailwinds? And when they do turn into tailwinds, would you consider reinvesting some of those into pricing or should we think about you flowing those through to the bottom line?",1
"When you think about India and those markets, do you kind of believe that some of those markets could get to much higher or a more normalized market share that you have in some of the developing countries over time? And can you talk a little bit about some of those efforts you may be doing?",1
"Well, Wamsi, I think, let me start with where we are right now. I think you're right. I think we've been able to navigate a difficult foreign exchange environment for a number of years and now, as you know, because we have this hedging program as the dollar has weakened a bit in recent months, although during the last week it's actually started to turn the other way again, we've got the hedging program that works both ways. And also on the memory front, we feel that for NAND, we're going to be turning the corner very soon. For DRAM, we also think that we are near the peak, possibly at the end of this year. And so that should provide some level of stability.",1
"As I said earlier this year, I think we are experiencing in total a more difficult cost environment and so hopefully that can turn into a positive for us. At the same time, it's very difficult for me to give you an indication of what is going to happen in the future because every product cycle is different, and as you know, we don't provide guidance past the current quarter. There are some elements that we understand quite well and we tend to manage well over the course of the cycle.",1
"For example, our cost structures that we are able to manage throughout the year. But there are also elements that are not entirely under our control like foreign exchange. And the mix of products and services that we sell to our customers also has an impact on the overall gross margin.",1
"Our primary consideration is always around maximizing gross margin dollars, and that is the approach that we take around for example pricing decisions.",1
"From Citi, we'll hear from Jim Suva.",1
"Thank you very much. And I'll ask actually both my questions at the same time, one for Tim and one for Luca. Tim, strategically when we talk to investors they often say, oh, iPhone market is saturated. There's not much room for growth. Yet when we do our analysis, we kind of still see emerging markets like India and all those still are growth.",1
"While we grew year-over-year in developed markets, and while we had record March quarter results in a number of major markets including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan, we did experience a revenue decline in emerging markets. But we feel positive about our trajectory. Our year-over-year revenue performance in Greater China improved relative to the December quarter, and we've seen very positive customer response to the pricing actions we've taken in that market, our trade-in and financing programs in our retail stores, the effects of government measures to stimulate the economy, and improved trade dialog between the United States and China.",1
"Our App Store results are still reflecting the impact of the slowdown in regulatory approval in gaming apps in China, but we're encouraged by the recent increase in the pace of approvals. We believe strongly in our long-term opportunity in China, thanks to our robust ecosystem, our talented developer community, and the country's growing population of tech-savvy consumers who value the very best products and services. For iPhone, while our worldwide revenue was down 17% from a year ago, declines were significantly smaller in the final weeks of the March quarter.",1
"Looking back at the past five months, November and December were the most challenging, so this is an encouraging trend. We like the direction we're headed with iPhone and our goal now is to pick up the pace. Importantly, our active installed base of devices continues to grow in each of our geographic segments, and set a new all-time record for all major product categories. That growing installed base is a reflection of the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, and it's driving our Services business to new heights.",1
"Services gross margin was 63.8%, up 100 basis points sequentially due to a different mix and leverage from higher revenue. Net income was $11.6 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.46 and operating cash flow was $11.2 billion.",1
"In the last calendar year alone, the partners that have joined this effort have generated enough clean energy to power over 600,000 homes in the United States. We're very proud of the progress that we and our partners are making, and hope our actions will inspire other businesses to do what they can to protect the world that we share.",1
"We are as excited as ever about our great pipeline of hardware, software and services and we're looking forward to sharing more information about the future of our four software platforms at our Worldwide Developer Conference now less than five weeks from now. Everyone here is hard at work to prepare for WWDC, and it's always a privilege to get to share the future of our platforms with the community of world changing developers who bring it to life. You are not going to want to miss this one.",1
"We're in the fortunate position of generating more cash than we need to run our business and invest confidently in our future, so today we're announcing the latest update to our capital return program including an increase to our share repurchase authorization and our quarterly dividend.",1
"For more details on that and our March quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.",1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue in the March quarter was $58 billion near the high end of the guidance range that we provided 90 days ago and down 5% from last year. Our revenue decline reflects 200 basis points of negative foreign exchange, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Overall, products revenue declined 9% driven primarily by iPhone, while Services revenue grew 16% to a new all-time record.",1
"We also set a new March quarter record for Wearables Home and Accessories, and we recorded our best iPad growth rate in six years. Company gross margin was 37.6% in line with our guidance. Products gross margin was 31.2% down about 310 basis points sequentially due to the seasonal loss of leverage and headwinds from foreign exchange.",1
"Let me provide more color for our various revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $31.1 billion. We're seeing positive customer response to recent pricing actions in certain emerging markets, as well as enhancements to our trade-in and financing programs. And our year-over-year performance improved relative to our December quarter results in Greater China, in the Americas and in Japan.",1
"In fact, we had our best quarter ever for the App Store, Apple Music cloud services, and our App Store search ad business, and we set new March quarter revenue records for AppleCare and Apple Pay. Apple Pay transaction volume more than doubled year-over-year, and we're on track to reach 10 billion transactions this calendar year. Apple Pay is now available in 30 markets, and we expect to be live in 40 markets by the end of the year. More and more transit systems are accepting Apple Pay and New York's MTA system will begin the rollout in early summer.",1
"Our active installed base of iPhone reached a new all-time high at the end of March. This growing installed base reflects the industry leading satisfaction and loyalty of our customers. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. And among business buyers, who plan to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones.",1
"Turning to Services. As Tim said, it was our best quarter ever with $11.5 billion in revenue, an increase of 16% from last year. We generated double-digit revenue growth across the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business. And we set all-time services revenue records in four of our five geographic segments. We're very happy with this performance. As you can see from our new disclosures, Services accounted for 20% of our March quarter revenue and about one-third of our gross profit dollars.",1
"Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached another new all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts, also setting a new all-time record and growing by strong double-digits over last year. And we now have over 390 million paid subscriptions across our Services portfolio, an increase of 120 million versus just 12 months ago. All subscription categories are growing strong double-digits and as we mentioned a quarter ago, we expect the number of paid subscriptions to surpass 0.5 billion during 2020.",1
"On the App Store, our subscription business is extremely diversified and is growing strongly around the world. In fact, the number of paid third-party subscriptions increased by over 40% compared to last year in each of our geographic segments. And across all third-party subscription apps, the largest accounted for only 0.3% of our total Services revenue.",1
"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $5.5 billion compared to $5.8 billion a year ago with the decline driven primarily by processor constraint on certain popular models. In spite of this challenge, we generated double-digit Mac revenue growth in Japan and Korea setting new all-time Mac revenue records in both markets. On a global basis, nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac and the active installed base of Macs reached a new all-time high.",1
"We had great results for iPad with $4.9 billion in revenue and growth accelerating from the December quarter to 22%. iPad revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments, with a return to growth in Greater China and strong double-digit growth in all other segments. We had our best March quarter ever for iPad in Japan, and we were especially pleased by performance in Korea, Thailand and Mexico where revenue more than doubled over last year.",1
"We've announced a major expansion of our recycling programs, including quadrupling the number of locations where U.S. customers can send their iPhones to be disassembled by Daisy, our recycling robot. Each Daisy can now disassemble 1.2 million devices per year, allowing recovered materials to be recycled into the manufacturing process. And we partnered with a record number of our suppliers to follow our lead and transition to 100% clean energy. With the help of these 44 suppliers, we will exceed our goal of bringing four gigawatts of renewable energy into our supply chain by 2020 with over one additional gigawatt projected within that time frame.",1
Apple's innovation extends beyond the impact we have in the lives of our customers to the impact we leave on the world around us. We recently marked Earth Day with several major announcements about our efforts to leave the world better than we found it. We've completed the allocation of our $2.5 billion green bond proceeds across 40 environmental initiatives around the world to projects ranging from solar power generation to water conservation to development of custom alloys for our products made from 100% recycled aluminum.,1
"In February, we announced that we are working with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to make health records on iPhone available to veterans. This will be the first record sharing platform of its kind available to the VA, which is the largest medical system in the U.S. providing service to more than nine million veterans across more than 1,200 facilities.",1
"For example, last month Stanford Medicine reported results of the Apple Heart Study, the largest study ever of its kind, which enrolled over 400,000 participants from all 50 states in a span of only eight months. And hundreds of institutions are now supporting health records on iPhone with recent additions including Michigan Medicine and UT Health Austin.",1
"Just like when the ECG app launched in the United States, there's hardly a day that goes by that I don't get a letter or an e-mail from a customer in one of these countries talking about how this feature has significantly changed their life. We believe we're really just beginning to tap into what we can do to help our users actively manage their health and well-being.",1
"With each passing quarter, we're more inspired by the impact our products are having on people's fitness and health. This quarter, we brought the ECG app on Apple Watch Series 4 to Hong Kong and 19 European countries including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the U.K.",1
"As part of this initiative, we rolled out new trade-in and financing programs in the U.S., China, the U.K., Spain, Italy, and Australia. The results have been striking. Across our stores, we had an all-time record response to our trade-in programs and with more than 4 times the trade-in volume of our March quarter a year ago.",1
"With the new Apple-designed H1 chip, the new AirPods deliver faster connect times, more talk time, and the convenience of hands-free Hey Siri. Our retail and online stores continue to be a key point of innovation. As we mentioned in January, we've been working on an initiative to make it simple to trade in a phone in our store, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the old phone to the new phone.",1
"In addition, we introduced a new iPad Mini, a major upgrade for iPad fans who love an ultra-portable design and like the new iPad Air, it delivers the power of the A12 Bionic and support for Apple Pencil. Last month, we introduced new AirPods, the second generation of the world's most popular wireless headphones and demand has been incredible. This is nothing less than a cultural phenomenon.",1
"For iPad, we were very happy to return to growth in Greater China while generating strong double-digit growth in each of our other geographic segments. Our great iPad results were driven primarily by strong customer response to iPad Pro. Late in the quarter, we launched an all-new iPad Air with an ultra-thin design, Apple Pencil support, and high-end performance powered by Apple's A12 Bionic chip.",1
"We also had several major product introductions during the quarter. We launched a new, more powerful iMac with dramatic increases in both compute and graphics performance, making it a great update for consumers and pros alike. For our Mac business overall, we faced some processor constraints in the March quarter leading to a 5% revenue decline compared to last year, but we believe that our Mac revenue would have been up compared to last year without those constraints and don't believe this challenge will have a significant impact on our Q3 results.",1
"We were thrilled to provide a peek at what's new for TV. Beginning in mid-May, the all-new Apple TV app will bring together the different ways to discover and watch shows, movies, sports news, and more in one app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, smart TVs, and streaming devices. And users can subscribe to and watch new Apple TV channels like HBO Showtime and Starz paying only for services they want all on-demand available on and offline. And coming this fall, Apple TV+ will be the new home for the world's most creative storytellers featuring exclusive original shows, movies, and documentaries.",1
"We also previewed Apple Arcade, the world's first game subscription service for mobile, desktop, and the living room. With over 100 new games, all with no ads or ad tracking, no additional purchases, and respect for user privacy, we've created a service for players of all ages, kids to teens to adults and one that families can enjoy together. The App Store is already the world's biggest gaming platform and we think Apple Arcade is a great way to unleash the creativity of the game developer community with a collection of new games not available on any other mobile platform or in any other subscription service. We can't wait for our customers to experience it for themselves beginning this fall.",1
"Apple News+ builds on our commitment to supporting quality journalism from trusted sources, while providing the best magazine and news reading experience ever for mobile devices. Advancing our vision to replace the wallet, we announced Apple Card built on principles Apple stands for like transparency, simplicity, and privacy. Apple Card is integrated into the Wallet app and delivers all new experiences that only Apple can provide integrating our hardware, software and services in an elegant solution that places the customer at the center. It's the first card to encourage you to pay less interest, eliminate fees, and give you daily cash on all your purchases and customer interest to date has been terrific.",1
"These features aren't just nice to have. They actually help to eliminate the boundary between hardware, software, and service, creating a singularly exceptional experience for our users. First, building on the great momentum of Apple News, which is already the number one news app in the United States and the United Kingdom, we launched Apple News+. It will bring together over 30 popular magazines, leading newspapers, and digital publishers into a beautiful, convenient, and curated experience within the Apple News app.",1
"Subscriptions are a powerful driver of our Services business. We reached a new high of over 390 million paid subscriptions at the end of March, an increase of 30 million in the last quarter alone. This was also an incredibly important quarter for our Services moving forward. In March, we previewed a game-changing array of new services, each of them rooted in principles that are fundamentally Apple. They're easy to use. They feature unmatched attention to detail. They put a premium on user privacy and security. They're expertly curated, personalized, and ready to be shared by everyone in your family.",1
"As we've seen in places like London, Tokyo, and Shanghai, contactless entry into transit systems helps to spur broader Apple Pay adoption, and we believe this will get even more people using Apple Pay in the United States. And Ticketmaster has just announced that they will be accepting Apple Pay for ticket purchases on the web and through the Ticketmaster app, and over 50 of their entertainment and sporting event venues are launching contactless tickets this year, including the vast majority of NFL stadiums.",1
"China, I continue to believe is a phenomenal country with lots of opportunity from a market point of view, but also lots of opportunity from a app developer point of view. We have almost 2 million application developers in China that are writing apps for iOS and the App Store, and they're doing unbelievably creative work and innovative work. So we look at China holistically, not only as a market.",1
"Yes, Tim, I think there is China numbers are actually phenomenal in the quarter and third consecutive quarter of growth. I think there's been a lot of concerns just Apple in China and maybe misinformation out there. But what do you see as the drivers for Apple in both Mainland China and Greater China over the next few years? And also if you could just give us an update on what you're seeing in India.",1
"First, I want to note that liquidity has not been an issue for us during these highly unusual financial market conditions. We have an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, very deep access to capital markets, and unmatched free cash flow generation. We ended the quarter with $193 billion in cash plus marketable securities, total debt of $110 billion. And as a result, net cash was $83 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned $22 billion to shareholders during the March quarter, including $18.5 billion through open market repurchases of 64.7 million Apple shares, and $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $267.2 billion in cash plus marketable securities, and we had $110 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $145 billion. We returned nearly $27 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.2 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $23.5 billion on repurchases of 137 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also retired 5.7 million shares upon the completion of our 13 ASR during the quarter.",1
"NPD indicates that iPad has 53% of the U.S. tablet market in the March quarter, up from 40% share a year ago. And the most recent customer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 95% and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the June quarter, 73% plan to purchase iPads.",1
"We continue to make great strides in the enterprise market. In February, we announced a new cyber risk management solution for businesses with Cisco, Aon and Allianz. This combined approach is an industry first that integrates the most secure technology from Apple and Cisco, cyber resilience evaluation services from Aon and options for enhanced cyber insurance coverage from Allianz. Organizations will now be able to better manage and protect themselves from cyber risks associated with ransomware and other malware-related threats. We are thrilled that insurance industry leaders recognize that Apple products provide superior security.",1
"In March, we announced two new services with IBM to bring more dynamic and intelligent insights into apps. IBM Watson services for Core ML and IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple will enable developers to more easily build native iOS apps that bring together machine learning with artificial intelligence and cloud services.",1
"In healthcare, iPhones are being used across leading health systems including Cedars-Sinai, the Mayo Clinic and HCA Healthcare with iOS apps to support clinical workflows, communications and care delivery. In fact, HCA Healthcare recently announced they plan to deploy 100,000 iPhones across their hospital sites within the next three years.",1
"We had great performance from our retail and online stores which produced their highest March quarter revenue ever. Year-over-year growth was led by iPhone as well as strong performance from AirPods and introduction of HomePod. Our stores hosted more than 250,000 of our very popular Today at Apple sessions with a particular emphasis on coding and app design.",1
"During the quarter, we opened beautiful new stores in South Korea and in Austria, our first in both countries, and three weeks ago we opened our newest store in Tokyo, bringing us to 502 stores across the world today.",1
"We have now completed over $275 billion of our current $300 billion capital return program, including $200 billion in share repurchases against our cumulative $210 million buyback program. We will complete the $210 billion program during the June quarter, three full quarters sooner than initially planned.",1
"Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac which set a new March quarter revenue record including new records in both the Americas and Greater China. We sold 4.1 million Macs, generating year-over-year growth in many emerging markets including Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and India. We were happy to see double digit growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all-time high, with almost 60% of March quarter purchases coming from customers who are new to Mac.",1
"The biggest priorities for our cash have not changed over the years. We want to maintain the cash we need to fund our day-to-day operations, to invest in our future, and to provide flexibility so that we can respond effectively to the strategic opportunities we encounter along the way. As we said 90 days ago, the new tax legislation enacted in December gives us increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our global cash. It allows us to invest for growth in the United States more efficiently and it also provides us the opportunity to work towards a more optimal capital structure. As we said in February, our goal is to become approximately net cash neutral over time.",1
"Given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value that we see in our stock, our board has authorized a new $100 billion share repurchase program which we will start executing during the June quarter. Considering the unprecedented size of this new authorization, we want to be particularly thoughtful and flexible in our approach to repurchasing shares. Our intention is to execute our program efficiently and at a fast pace. As in the past, we will provide regular updates on our capital return activities at the end of every quarter.",1
"We're also raising our dividend for the sixth time in less than six years. As we know, it is very important for our investors who value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.63 to $0.73 per share, an increase of 16%. This is effective with our next dividend which the board has declared today, payable on May 17, 2018, to shareholders of record as of May 14, 2018.",1
"With over $13 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be among the largest dividend payers in the world and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. We will continue to review our capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, our investment opportunities, and our financial outlook. We will also continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix and the pace of our program. We expect to provide a new update to our capital allocation plans approximately 12 months from now.",1
"As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million. And we expect our tax rate to be about 14.5%.",1
"Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow up. May we have the first question, please?",1
"iPad grew both units and revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter. We sold 9.1 million iPads and about half of purchases were by customers new to iPad. Growth was particularly strong in Japan, in Latin America, Middle East and Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. All markets where iPad sales were up double digits compared to a year ago. We gained share of the global tablet market based on the latest estimates from IDC and our active installed base of iPads reached an all-time high.",1
"Our other product category also set a new record for the March quarter with revenue of almost $4 billion. We began shipping HomePod in February and unit sales of both Apple Watch and AirPods reached a new high for the March quarter. When we combine all our wearables and home products, they accounted for over 90% of the total growth in the other products category.",1
"We'll go to Brian White with Monness, Crespi.",1
"Consistent with our annual cadence, today we're providing an update on our capital return program. Tax reform makes it possible for us to execute our program more efficiently, both through share repurchases and payment of dividend to the tens of millions of investors who own Apple stock either directly or indirectly from large pension funds to individuals with retirement accounts.",1
"Also in iOS 11.3, patients in nearly 40 health systems representing hundreds of hospitals and clinics can now consolidate their medical records from multiple sources and view them all in one place, right from their iPhone. This data is encrypted and protected with the user's iPhone passcode, and it can help them better understand their health history, have informed conversations with doctors and family members, and make future health care decisions.",1
"Consistent with our long-term focus, privacy is a key element of these initiatives for education and personal health. We're relentless about making the best products and experiences in the world, while fiercely protecting our users' privacy, because we believe privacy is a fundamental human right.",1
"Our environmental initiatives recently passed an important milestone. All of our global facilities across 43 countries are now powered with 100% clean energy. We work with communities around the world to build clean power sources. Apple now has 25 renewable energy projects operational and 15 more under construction. We're also driving our supply chain to use clean energy. As of last month, 23 of our suppliers are committed to operating on 100% renewable energy.",1
"We're now halfway through our fiscal 2018 with nearly $150 billion in revenue and double digit growth in all of our geographic segments. We generated almost $34 billion in earnings in six months, and we're very bullish on Apple's future. We have the best pipeline of products and services we've ever had. We have a huge installed base of active devices that is growing across all products, and we have the highest customer loyalty and satisfaction in the industry.",1
Our services business is growing dramatically. Our balance sheet and our cash flow generation are strong and that allows us to invest significantly in our product roadmap and still return a very meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders.,1
"Recent corporate tax reform enables us to deploy our global cash more efficiently. In the United States, we expect our direct investment in the economy to exceed $350 billion over the next five years, including $30 billion in capital expenditures. And we expect to create over 20,000 U.S. jobs at Apple over that timeframe. We're narrowing the site selection for a new U.S. campus, and we look forward to sharing more information on that later this year.",1
"So today, given our strong confidence in Apple's future, we're announcing a significant update to our capital return program. Our Board of Directors has approved a new $100 billion share repurchase authorization as well as a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend, effective with our next dividend payable later this month. Luca will provide more details about our program as well as a more in-depth discussion of the quarter's results.",1
"The App Store set a new all-time revenue record in the March quarter and Apple Music reached a new record for both revenue and paid subscribers, which have now passed 40 million. iCloud storage revenue was up by over 50% year-over-year to a new all-time record, and AppleCare revenue grew at its highest rate in five quarters, setting a new March quarter record.",1
So I'll now turn the call over to him. Luca?,1
"Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. We're very pleased to report record financial results for our March quarter with revenue growth of 16%, EPS up 30%. Starting with revenue, we generated $61.1 billion, our highest ever for a March quarter. Revenue grew in all of our geographic segments, setting new Q2 records in most countries we track. Performance was very strong in emerging markets where revenue was up 20% and we were especially pleased to see 21% year-over-year growth in Greater China, our strongest growth rate from that segment in 10 quarters. We also set Q2 revenue records in the Americas, in Europe and in Japan.",1
"Gross margin was 38.3%, essentially flat sequentially, as we offset the seasonal loss of leverage with cost improvements and a shift in mix toward services. Operating margin was 26% of revenue. Net income was $13.8 billion, up $2.8 billion over last year and a March quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $2.73, up 30% to a new record for Q2, and cash flow from operations was very strong at $15.1 billion. iPhone revenue grew 14% year-over-year, with iPhone ASP increasing to $728 from $655 a year ago, driven primarily by the performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.",1
"During the quarter we sold 52.2 million iPhones, up 3% over last year, and we grew iPhone units by double digits in several markets including Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico and Vietnam. Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was even stronger than our reported results, as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.8 million units, 600,000 units more than the March quarter reduction last year. We exited the March quarter within our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory.",1
"Our customers are extremely happy with their iPhones. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates that across all iPhone models, the customer satisfaction rating was 95%, and combining iPhone 8, 8 Plus and iPhone X, customer satisfaction was even higher, at 99%. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPhones.",1
"Turning to services. We had a sensational quarter with all-time record revenue of $9.2 billion, and that's up more than $2 billion from last year, an increase of 31% and double the services revenue we generated in the March quarter just four years ago. Our services business is growing at a very fast pace all around the world, with revenue up more than 25% year-over-year in each of our five geographic segments.",1
"Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about your thoughts on sort of iPhone and positioning now that we're a couple of quarters out from the launch of the iPhone X. Given the $1,000 price point, and it's clearly selling but there's been a lot of questions in the market about sustainability of that price point and how you're thinking about it as you look out sort of holistically across your lineup. So if you could talk a bit about what you're hearing from your customers and then I have a follow up. Thank you.",1
"Sure. Shannon, it's Tim. As Luca mentioned earlier, our revenues are up 14% year-over-year on iPhone and that's a combination of single digit unit growth and ASP growth that is mainly driven by iPhone X. I think that our iPhone line shows that there's a variety of different customers in a market that is as large as a smartphone market and so we're going to continue to provide different iPhones for folks to meet their needs.",1
"On iPhone X specifically, I think it's important to maybe emphasize again one of the things I mentioned in my opening comments, that customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each and every week in the March quarter, just as they did following its launch in the December quarter.",1
"We protect it by encrypting it, and we keep the bulk of information or a significant amount of information on the device so that the user is in control of it. We also collect much less overall than others do. Because if you look at our model, if we can convince you to buy an iPhone or an iPad, we'll make a little bit of money. You're not our product. And so that's how we look at that.",1
The iPhone obviously had to do extremely well to get a 21% number. And we gained share in the market for the Mac as well. And so there's actually several vectors there that are working well for us.,1
"We also â more broadly on the iPhone, the iPhone was the top three selling phones in China. And so it's iPhone X was number one, but we had several in the top.",1
"From RBC Capital Markets, Amit Daryanani.",1
"Thanks a lot. Two questions from me as well. I guess first one, just touching on the gross margin dynamics, if I look at the guidance for June on a year-over-year basis, I think sales are up double digit but gross margins are still flat at the high end, maybe down 20 basis points at the midpoint. Can you just talk about what's driving the lack of leverage on a gross margin basis on a year-over-year basis for June?",1
"Yeah, Amit, it's Luca. We tend to look at our gross margin dynamics on a sequential basis, and essentially we're guiding to about flat on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, it's less relevant for our business. But in general, I would say that this year we are seeing a more difficult cost environment, particularly we're still dealing with about 70 basis points of impact from the memory pricing environment that we're working through.",1
"Got it. And if I could just follow up. Tim, you've been fairly vocal I think talking about the need for better privacy protection and well-crafted regulation over time. Could you just maybe help us understand, how does Apple protect consumer data? And how does this ongoing debate around data protection translate into a positive for Apple over time?",1
"In terms of benefit, we don't really view it like that. We view that privacy is a fundamental human right and that it's an extremely complex situation if you're a user to understand a lot of the user agreements and so forth. And we've always viewed that part of our role was to sort of make things as simple as possible for the user and provide them a level of privacy and security. And so that's how we look at it.",1
"Also, since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in 2014, this is the first cycle that we've ever had where the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular. And so with the customer set that Luca referenced as well, the 99%, the iPhone X is a beloved product. And so I think that it's one of those things where like a team wins the Super Bowl, maybe you want them to win by a few more points but it's a Super Bowl winner and that's how we feel about it. I could not be prouder of the product.",1
"Great. Thank you. Luca, could you talk a bit more about the capital allocation? The dividend increase of 16% was relatively low relative to what you could have done, so are you really thinking the stock price is attractive here? And you said you would execute the buyback at a fast pace. Can you give us any timeframe of that $100 billion and how much debt do you think about in terms of net cash zero?",1
"Yes. Let's start with the dividend. We're increasing it by 16%. This is the largest increase that we've done since we've reintroduced the dividend back in August of 2012. So we think it's a very meaningful increase for all the investors that value income. Obviously, when we come down to capital allocation decisions, we obviously also keep in mind that the opportunity for us to do some M&A activities which we do in an ongoing basis.",1
"But when it comes down between dividends and buyback, our view is that for a variety of reasons we see a lot of value in the stock. We believe the stock is undervalued and so we have a bias towards the buyback. So the dividend is a very large component of capital return because we're going to be returning more than $13 billion a year to investors through dividends but we believe that given where we are with the valuation of the stock, we think that we continue to do the buyback primarily.",1
"We are not giving an end date to the program this time because the amount is very, very large and so we will try to execute it. As you've seen from our track record during the last five years, we will do it at a very fast pace but we also want to do it efficiently. We want to make sure that we buy back the stock at the right time. And so with that in mind, we have done $23.5 billion of repurchases during the March quarter. We will give you an update to our activities at the end of every quarter and then 12 months from now we will actually talk about an update to the entire program. So you will be able to keep track of our progress every 90 days.",1
"Thank you. And, Tim, could you talk a bit about your healthcare opportunity? Is it merely selling watches over time or do you think more broadly about it? Is there a services play? You're doing some things for your employees. Could that potentially broaden out? How do you think about the opportunity there?",1
"We think about it very broadly and you can tell that a bit by some of the things that we've had going with ResearchKit and CareKit and most recently the health records that I had referenced in my initial comments and those all came out of getting significantly engaged in the Apple Watch and sort of pulling the strings, so to speak. And we also have a heart study that is going on currently, and so I don't want to give too much away. But it's an area of great interest where we think we can make a big difference in. And so it's a major strategic thrust of ours.",1
"It's a good question. iPhone X was the most popular smartphone in all of China last quarter. And so iPhone X has done well there. In order to hit a number like 21% on the growth that you see on your data sheet there, there has to be several things working well. And the things that have huge growth rates there are the other products category, which is our wearables business in China and the services business, which you and I just spoke about.",1
"Okay. And then any potential tariff issues aside, what's working for Apple in China right now? You talked about it being the strongest year-over-year growth in 10 quarters. I guess, what's driving that? Is it iPhone X specifically, or something else that's behind that improvement? Thank you.",1
"And so with that kind of change in the installed base and with the services that we have now and others that we are working on, I think this is just a huge opportunity for us and feel very good about the track that we're on.",1
"And I think the other good news is that because our active installed base is at such a level, that last quarter we said that we had exceeded 1.3 billion. This year â we're not going to release this number every quarter, but we've obviously grown again. And it's growing at a double digit number on a year-over-year basis.",1
"Well, Mike, it's Tim. Again, the great thing about services is there are several services that make up the total that are growing nicely.",1
"Hey. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Just following on the services question, I'd be curious what the next drivers of services revenue are. Will it be continued penetration of Music and Pay that you see as kind of the largest future categories of incremental growth? Or maybe when could augmented reality become a material part of services? And then I have a follow up.",1
And that will come from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.,1
"And so I'm a big believer that the two countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently. And so that's our focus, and I'm optimistic that â I don't know every play by play that will happen, but over time, I think that view will prevail.",1
"Yeah, I think my own view is that China and the U.S. have this unavoidable mutuality where China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins and the world only wins if China and the U.S. win. And so I think there's lots of things that bind the countries together and I'm actually very optimistic. I think history shows us that countries that embrace openness and diversity do much, much better than the ones that are closed.",1
"And it doesn't look like the threat of a trade war with China slowed down that business. In fact, growth accelerated. But anything anecdotally that you see in the business in recent weeks that would suggest that that is having an impact on demand and any actions that Apple is taking as a company to preempt any risk of tariffs going forward?",1
"And so it's very broad-based in terms of type of service and geographic region. It's sort of exactly what we would like to see. In terms of forecasting moving forward, we've obviously made assumption for our guidance that Luca provided earlier and in terms of longer term, we're on target to our 2020 goal of doubling the services revenue of 2016 as we had talked about previously.",1
"Hi, Katy. It's Tim. The services grew 31%. We hit an all-time record at $9.2 billion, first time we cleared $9 billion. The great news about it is, it's not a single geo or a single service. If you look at it, each of the geos, the minimum was at 25%. So each of the geos did extremely well and we set records from the App Store to the Apple Music to iCloud to Apple Pay and more. And underneath that, if you look at the subscriptions, the number of subscriptions, I think I mentioned this in my comments, paid subscriptions had moved up over 100 million on a year-over-year basis to over 270 million by the end of the quarter.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon. The services growth acceleration is really the highlight this quarter in my mind. Can you talk about what the biggest drivers, whether it be products or regions that drove the acceleration and do you think that we can continue to see growth north of 30%? And then I have a follow-up.",1
Thank you. Shannon.,1
So that was essentially component purchases?,1
"Yeah, Shannon, you know that we've always generated significant amount of cash through working capital. We've got a negative cash conversion cycle and we plan to continue to have that. Our inventory level has gone up. It's just a temporary event. We have decided to make some purchasing decision, given current market conditions, and that should unwind over time.",1
"Okay. Thank you. And then, Luca, can you talk a bit about working capital, specifically inventory which went up pretty significantly quarter-over-quarter? What's driving that and how are you thinking about, I mean, it's one of the uses of cash obviously, so how are you thinking about inventory and maybe working capital in general as you're going forward?",1
"In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the March quarter were new to iPad and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high.",1
"iPad revenue growth has been fueled primarily by the great customer response to our new iPad Pros. These completely redesigned iPads with full-screen Liquid Retina display, Face ID, powerful A12X Bionic chip with Neural Engine and support for the new Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard make iPad Pro the perfect PC laptop replacement for both consumers and professionals.",1
The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 93% customer satisfaction rating for iPad overall. Among customers who plan to purchase tablets 77% of consumers and 75% of businesses plan to purchase iPads.,1
"While our product teams were preparing to launch a new iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, MacBook Air and the new iPhone SE, all of which have been very well received by reviewers and consumers alike, they were also working with our suppliers to design, test, manufacture and distribute more than 7.5 million face shields, and we continue to ship more than 1 million of these every week to the doctors, nurses and medical personnel on the frontlines.",1
"Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speaks as of their respective dates.",1
"Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I hope youâre staying safe and well.",1
"Today Apple reports $58.3 billion in revenue, an all-time record for Services, and a quarterly record for Wearables, Home and Accessories. It was also a quarterly revenue record for Apple Retail powered by phenomenal growth in our online store. Amid the most challenging global environment in which weâve ever operated our business, weâre proud to say that Apple grew during the quarter.",1
"But before we dive more deeply into the numbers, I want to speak just for a bit on COVID-19. This is something Apple has been contending with since January. And I think that how we have responded, what we have been inspired to do, tells an important story about Appleâs great durability as a business, and the enduring importance of our products in our customersâ lives. It also speaks to Appleâs unmatched capacity to be creative, to think always in terms of the long term and to forge ahead when others may feel an instinct to pull back.",1
"Before COVID-19 was on the horizon, we anticipated that Q2 was going to be a prolific and energetic period for Apple. And when the pandemic did strike, our teams not only succeeded in growing the business in introducing powerful new products, and in meeting our customersâ needs, but they also rose to the occasion in terms of meeting our broader obligations to the communities in which we live and work.",1
"Letâs look quickly across the business. At the same time that they were leaving no stone unturned to get our latest generation of devices manufactured and into our customersâ hands, our worldwide network of supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks in every part of the Company were also sourcing more than 30 million masks for frontline medical workers, ensuring theyâre donated to places of greatest need in every region around the world.",1
"In a quarter where our Services teams achieved strong growth, which Luca will dig into in a minute, and which speaks to the real durability of our Services strategy, these teams were also putting COVID-19 front and center. As Apple News, reached 125 million monthly active users, we elevated trusted information from reliable sources through a special COVID-19 vertical.",1
"Please note that some of the information youâll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the Companyâs business and results of operations.",1
"We let customers skip payments without incurring interest on Apple Card for March and April in light of financial hardship for many families. We worked with everyone from Oprah to Lady Gaga to inform, entertain and give back through Apple TV and services like FaceTime and Messages set new all-time records for daily volume during this quarter as users relied on their devices to stay connected in a new reality.",1
"In software, at the same time that our teams worked with great creativity and excitement as we prepare to deliver our first ever all online Worldwide Developers Conference later this quarter, they also worked with the same creativity and speed to put together our COVID-19 symptom checking website and app in partnership with the CDC. As of today, the app has been installed nearly 2 million times and the web tool has received over 3 million unique visits. And just this month, to accelerate contact tracing, we are launching a joint effort with Google to enable the use of Bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of the virus with user privacy and security central to the design.",1
"We paired these programmatic efforts with a broader strategy to get back where itâs needed most. Weâve made major corporate donations to response efforts around the world to support global citizens as well as a new fund for Americans experiencing food insecurity as a result of the crisis. When you tally these things up and consider our ongoing 2 to 1 match for employee donations, Appleâs contributions to the global response are significant, diverse, and a great source of pride for the whole chain.",1
"Weâre also doing what we can to help our employees, their families, and by extension their communities stay safe and well by modifying our operations where appropriate. This extends of course to our retail employees, they are Appleâs face to our customers and an instrumental part of our business and weâre compensating them normally despite store closures.",1
"During a quarter where circumstances evolve by the hour, we have been gratified by the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain. While we felt some temporary supply constraints in February, our operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work and production was back at typical levels toward the end of March.",1
"At this time of social distance, of shuttered school and gathering places, of delayed plans and new ways of socializing, we have seen significant evidence that our products have taken a renewed importance for customers. Teachers and students around the world are relying on our technology to teach, learn, and stay connected with each other. We are in the process of deploying major orders of iPads to school systems working to keep learning going strong at a distance, including tens of thousands in Ontario, Canada; Glasgow, Scotland and Puerto Rico, a 100,000 to the city of Los Angeles and 350,000 to New York City, our largest educational iPad deployment ever.",1
"Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Appleâs most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release.",1
"Speaking first today is Appleâs CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, weâll open the call to questions from analysts.",1
"Wearables Home and Accessories revenue set a new March quarter revenue record of $5.1 billion fueled primarily by the strong performance of our Wearables business, which grew close to 50%. Within this category, Apple Watch is the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world and produced its best results ever for a non-holiday quarter. It's reaching many new customers with three quarters of purchases going to customers who have never owned an Apple Watch before. Interest in AirPods has been off the charts and we're working hard to catch up with the incredible customer demand.",1
"And we would like to place retail stores there. And we're working with the government to seek approval to do that. And so, we plan on going in there with sort of all of our might.",1
"Okay, great.",1
â¦that we didn't think could be meaningful. So that's sort of the way I look at it.,1
Great.,1
"Yeah, these aren't hobbies.",1
"Okay. A quick follow-up on India, obviously market share there is well below China. I believe you're looking to start manufacturing there. But what's the -- obviously the potential could be huge but the market already seems to be pretty dominated on the Android side, so maybe if you could just talk about trying to really aggressively ramp up share there. Thank you.",1
I think India is a very important market in the long-term. It's a challenging market in the short-term. But we're learning a lot. We have started manufacturing there which is very important to be able to serve the market in a reasonable way. And we're growing that capability there.,1
"We've opened a developer, accelerator there, which we're very happy with some of the things coming out of there. It's a long-term play. It's not something that's going to be on overnight huge business. But I think the growth potential is phenomenal.",1
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.,1
It doesn't bother me that it's primarily Android business at the moment because that just means there's a lot of opportunity there.,1
"Thank you, Lou. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts as a webcast on Apple.com/investor and via telephone. And the numbers to the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820.",1
Please enter confirmation code 7060604. And these replays will be available by approximately 5:00 PM Pacific Time today.,1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Kristin Huguet at 408-974-2414. And financial analysts can contact Matt Blake or me with additional questions. Matt is at 408-974-7406, and I'm at 408-974-5420. And thanks again for joining us.",1
Good day everyone. Welcome to the Apple Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Todayâs call is being recorded.,1
"At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tejas Gala, Senior Manager, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.",1
"Since early March, weâve seen unprecedented demand for a pro app from students, enthusiasts and creative professionals. These folks are keeping us all entertained and inspired as we stay at home. And to help them do it, we made Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X available for free for 90-days for everyone. And the reaction has been overwhelming, driving software downloads and usage to record levels.",1
"And doctors and medical professionals are making even greater use of Apple Watch and other health features to communicate with patients and to treat them safely from a distance when necessary. With new FDA guidance on non-invasive remote patient monitoring, for example, the ECG app on Apple Watch is increasingly being used to facilitate remote ECG measurements and recordings for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and healthcare provider contact and exposure. Many hospitals such as Geisinger Health System, NYU Langone Health, and Stanford Health Care are using apps on iPad and iPhone to support communication and video conferences between hospitalized patients and their care teams. This enables the care teams to keep a close watch on patients without entering isolation rooms, which helps to minimize exposure and reduces some of the need for personal protective equipment.",1
"Now, when you step back and tally all this up, when you consider all the ways COVID-19 has touched Apple, our customers and the way we work, this may not have been the quarter it could have been absent this pandemic, but I don't think I can recall a quarter where I've been prouder of what we do or how we do it.",1
"Our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 140 company, and weâre very excited by the many opportunities in front of us for this product category. For example, Apple Watch continues to expand its reach as over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch around the world during the quarter were new to the product.",1
"While we did see a slight elongation in our replacement cycle towards the end of the quarter, which we attribute to the widespread point-of-sale closures, our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high. This speaks to the quality of our products and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined.",1
"Turning to Services. We set an all-time revenue record of $13.3 billion with strong performance across the board with all-time revenue records in the App Store, Apple Music, Video, cloud services, and our App Store search ad business. And we also set a March quarter record for AppleCare. Our new services, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus and Apple Card continue to add users, content and features while contributing to overall Services growth.",1
"As Tim mentioned, weâre well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal â16 Services revenue during 2020.",1
"App Store revenue grew by strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased over 30% year-over-year, reaching a new all-time high. Our first party subscription services also continued to perform very well. Apple Music and cloud services, both set all-time revenue record and AppleCare set a March quarter record. Paid subscriptions for all three of these services were up strong double-digits.",1
"Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow strongly, and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter. In particular, the number of paid accounts increased double digits in all of our geographic segments. We now have over 515 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 125 million from a year ago. On a sequential basis, paid subscriptions grew by over 35 million. This is the highest sequential growth we have ever experienced. With this momentum, weâre confident we will reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020.",1
"Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new March quarter record with revenue of $6.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year with strong double digit performance across all five geographic segments.",1
"Next, Iâd like to talk about Mac and iPad. Mac revenue was $5.4 billion; iPad revenue was $4.4 billion. Towards the end of the quarter, we launched a brand new iPad Pro that includes a first in class LiDAR scanner with some really exciting augmented reality applications; and MacBook Air with significantly improved performance at a lower price. Weâre very pleased with the strong customer interest for both products.",1
"As I said at the outset, we achieved revenue of $58.3 billion and underneath that was product revenue of $45 billion. The performance of our product business had three very different phases during the March quarter. Based on Appleâs performance during the first five weeks of the quarter, we were confident we were headed toward a record second quarter at the very high end of our expectations. In the next five weeks of the quarter, as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, as well as demand for our products within China. This caused us to withdraw our revenue guidance in February. At that point, demand for our products outside of China was still strong and in line with our expectations. During the last three weeks of the quarter, as the virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including the closure of all our retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13th, and many channel partner points of sales around the world, we saw downward pressure on demand, particularly for iPhone and Wearables.",1
"Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter were new to that product and the active installed base for both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high. And the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 95% for iPad and 96% for Mac.",1
"In the enterprise market businesses everywhere have been making the transition to working remotely. Weâve created content to assist our customers in this transition including an on-demand video learning series focused on topics like remote deployments of iPad and Mac and security. Weâve also realigned our own retail business and enterprise teams to provide timely and relevant support to customers as they navigate new work environments. Some of our largest customers offering Mac to employees such as IBM and SAP have been able to pivot quickly to allow employees to easily set up and secure their devices from home, benefiting from Apple Business Manager and zero-touch deployment.",1
"And weâve seen countless examples of new projects of remote deployments implemented in just a few hours. Peloton for instance, worked with our New York teams to deploy an entire fleet of Macs overnight, so their team could work remotely.",1
"In essential sectors, such as grocery and financial services, weâve seen organizations adopt our technology to better serve their customers safely. Leading grocers around the world, like Trader Joeâs, Woolworths, Lawsonâs, Sainsburyâs, Lidl, and Carrefour offer Apple Pay so customers can use contactless payments. And as stores shift to become fulfillment centers for online orders, organizations are leveraging apps for remote shoppers and food delivery to reduce foot traffic.",1
"In banking, where safety and securities are a top priority, one way to protect company and client information is by providing corporate iOS devices to employees who use mobile phones daily as part of their jobs. As an example, Bank of America is purchasing tens of thousands of additional iOS devices for their workforce.",1
Let me now turn to our cash position.,1
"On the demand side, after very strong first five weeks, we saw the impact of COVID-19 affect demand in China for the next five weeks, and then more broadly around the world for the last three weeks of the quarter, when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures became more widespread in many countries.",1
"On the supply side, we suffered from some temporary supply shortages during February, but weâve been extremely pleased with the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain, as well as its ability to get people back to work safely when circumstances allow. Our operations team and manufacturing partners put forth an extraordinary effort to restore production quickly, and we exited the quarter in a good supply position for most of our product lines.",1
"iPhone revenue of $29 billion, declined 7% year-over-year as both iPhone supply and demand were affected by the impact of COVID-19 at some point during the quarter.",1
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories.,1
"Net income was $11.2 billion and earnings per share with $2.55, up 4%. Operating cash flow was very strong at $13.3 billion, an improvement of $2.2 billion over a year ago.",1
"Services gross margin was 65.4%, up 100 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.4%. This was lower than our 16.5% guidance due to onetime discreet items.",1
"Company gross margin was 38.4%, flat sequentially with cost savings and mix shift towards Services offset by the seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 30.3%, decreasing 380 basis points sequentially due to loss of leverage and unfavorable mix. This drop was more pronounced than under normal circumstances due to the COVID-19 impact I mentioned earlier.",1
Services revenue followed a different trend with very strong year-over-year growth of 17%. We set a new all-time revenue record of $13.3 billion with all-time records in many of our Services categories and in most countries we track. Iâll provide more details on this later.,1
"After a very strong January, our performance was impacted particularly during the last three weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures increase due to COVID-19 spreading around the world and affected our product sales. However, on a demand basis, our performance was stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory more than we did a year ago. Importantly, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories.",1
"So, the revenue for the quarter was $58.3 billion, up 1% from a year ago, despite the extreme circumstances from the impact of COVID-19 and a headwind of a 100 basis points from foreign exchange. Products revenue was $45 billion, down 3%.",1
"It has been a very different quarter than we were expecting when we last talked to you at the end of January. But, we could not be more proud of our Apple teams around the world, our role in supporting local communities and our partners throughout the value chain, and how resilient our business and financial performance has been during these challenging times.",1
"With that, Iâll hand things off to Luca.",1
"And so, while we canât say for sure how many chapters are in this book, we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one. Apple will continue to do everything we can do to help the global response and to keep our customers learning, creating, sharing, and connecting so that life can remain as normal as it can during this challenging time.",1
"Major investments, including our five-year commitment to contribute $350 billion to the economy here in the United States are moving forward full speed ahead. Itâs in these moments that we set ourselves apart. Weâve always managed through difficult moments by doubling down and investing in the next generation of innovation. And thatâs our strategy today.",1
"Our long-running investment in our Services strategy is succeeding. This business is growing and is a reflection of our enduring large and growing installed base. We expect to meet our longstanding goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services revenue in 2020. We have always run Apple for the long term. We entered this period with unmatched financial strain, a robust cash position and our best product pipeline ever.",1
"Our teams worldwide have tackled the complexities of this moment with unmatched creativity, good humor and dedication to our customers. For a company whose business is innovation, there are real upsides in periodically having to figure out how to do just about everything in a brand new way.",1
"Given the lack of visibility and uncertainly in the near term, we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. Over the long term though, we have a high degree of confidence in the enduring strength of our business. Our global supply chain is profoundly durable and resilient. We have shown the consistent ability to meet and manage temporary supply challenges like those caused by COVID-19. We have continued to deliver innovative new products across multiple categories that appeal to a broad cross-section of customers, including the all-new iPhone SE, which achieved unmatched technological capacity at an incredible value.",1
"And so, we're working very hard to -- at the -- but at the very beginning of the ramp there. We wouldn't do a serviceâ¦",1
"And then, we're working very hard to get everyone to give Apple News+ a look. Because we think it's a very unique product. And I love magazines. And we have really wanted to support the publishers.",1
We think that most users are going to get multiple over-the-top products. And we're going to do our best to convince them that the Apple TV+ product should be one of them.,1
"Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, you talked about China responding well to these pricing actions that you've taken in that market. Do any of those learnings kind of carry through into how you decide pricing in the remaining emerging markets, like India, et cetera as you get ready for the next product cycle?",1
"Thank you very much for taking my question. Tim, can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing in China? Clearly, it looks like things are improving sequentially. You also mentioned that last few weeks of the quarter, were stabilizing in emerging markets, I believe. So what are customers saying there and what are your partners saying in China? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"Yeah. Thanks for the question, Shannon. We're seeing -- in the iPhone space, we saw a better year-over-year performance in the last weeks of the quarter as compared to the full quarter or November and December, which was sort of a -- it appears to be the trough. I think there's a set of reasons for this.",1
"One, we made some price adjustments essentially backing out the weaker currency effect and then some. There's stimulus programs that the government has executed including -- and this happened in early April, VAT being reduced from 16% to 13%, so they've been aggressive in the stimulus side.",1
"Three, our trade-in and financing programs that weâve implemented in our retail stores have been very well received there, and I'm happy with the results to date there. And then four, there's an improved trade dialog between the U.S. and China. And from our point of view, this has affected consumer confidence on the ground there in a positive way. And so, I think it's a set of all of these things and we certainly feel a lot better than we did 90 days ago.",1
"Great. Thank you. And then, I'm sure you're probably expecting a question on Qualcomm settlement. So what would you like to say on this settlement? How are you thinking about your component providers going forward? And how should we think about this with regard to -- I don't know your development plans in the future because I'm sure you're not going to talk about when you're going to do 5G, but clearly it helps that path. Thank you.",1
"Yeah. Thank you, Shannon. We're glad to put the litigation behind us, and all the litigation around the world has been dismissed and settled. We're very happy to have a multi-year supply agreement, and we're happy that we have a direct license arrangement with Qualcomm, which was I know important for both companies, and so we feel good about the resolution.",1
"We have made some adjustments in India, and we've seen preliminarily some better results there. Everything that we do does advise everything we do in the future, so we try to learn the best we can and hold [ph] that into our thinking, and we'll obviously do that with this as well.",1
"At the product category level, we expect that we will continue to have strong revenue growth from the non-iPhone categories as we've had for the first half of our fiscal year. We're also expecting a relative improvement in our iPhone performance on a year-over-year basis in Q3 versus the first half.",1
"Thank you. I just had a quick follow-up for Luca on the Services side. Luca, we see that you're guiding to higher operating expenses quarter-on-quarter. How much of that incremental is going in to support the new services that you're planning to launch later in the year?",1
"Yeah. Of course, we are supporting both our products and services business and you can see the trajectory of our OpEx over the different quarters. Clearly as we add new services, we will need to make the necessary investments to support them.",1
"Our Services business has multiple streams. In total, it is accretive to company gross margins. You've seen the latest -- we're running services margins at over 60%. So, it's a very important business for us in many ways for our ecosystem and for our ability to monetize it. And so, clearly we will make all the necessary investments to ensure that the new services are successful, and we're really encouraged by the level of customer response that we received so far in anticipation for the launch of these services.",1
"Thank you, Samik. Can we have the next question please.",1
The next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Thank you. Luca, if I look back over the past five years, June quarter revenue typically declines about 15% from the March quarter. You're guiding to an 8% drop this year. So can you just talk about, which regions or product segments you think can outperform that typical seasonality?",1
Certainly. Our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourselves to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?",1
"We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $250 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%. Also reflecting the approved increase, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock, payable on May 16, 2019 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2019.",1
"As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $52.5 billion and $54.5 billion. This guidance range comprehends 300 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact year-over-year. Also as a reminder, in the June quarter last year, our Services revenue included a favorable $236 million one-time item in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits.",1
"We paid over $14 billion in dividends and equivalents over the last four quarters alone, making us one of the largest dividend payers in the world. Going forward, we continue to plan for annual increases in dividends per share.",1
"Given our confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, our Board has authorized an additional $75 billion for share repurchases. And because we know many of our investors value income, we're also raising our quarterly dividend for the seventh time in less than seven years to $0.77, an increase of about 5% from the previous amount.",1
"Our priorities for cash have not changed over the years. Most importantly, we always want to maintain the cash we need to run our business, maintain strategic flexibility, and invest in our future. We're well on our way towards meeting the investment projections we laid out early last year. We also want to work towards a more optimal capital structure and as we said before, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time.",1
"As we execute those initiatives, we are also able to return over $27 billion to investors during the March quarter. We began a $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program in February, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 55.1 million shares. We also repurchased 71.7 million Apple shares for $12 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents.",1
"More recently, we've announced a major expansion in Austin Texas and in other cities across the country. All these efforts are essential investments to make sure that we're incorporating innovative ideas and top talent wherever they emerge.",1
"As a result, we are in a very strong position that allows us to invest confidently in all areas of the business, while continuing to return value to our shareholders. Just last year, we announced a commitment to contribute more than $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years, including the creation of 20,000 jobs.",1
"Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $225 billion in cash, plus marketable securities. We also had $101 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding, for a net cash position of almost $113 billion.",1
"And finally, our enterprise channels continue to build momentum. In February, our Apple at Work initiative was launched with AT&T. This extension to our ongoing collaboration with AT&T will make it easy for more customers to choose the best Apple products for their needs in the enterprise and modernize their business. AT&T will enable business services for Apple products to help companies with their IT strategy, including device management, security, productivity and collaboration.",1
"We see great momentum through the growing number of iOS SDKs being delivered by the world's largest enterprise platforms. For instance, SAP's SDK for iOS continues to gain strong traction with their customers, growing by more than 40% in the last six months. And this past quarter Salesforce released its SDK enabling developers to build native iOS applications directly on top of the Salesforce platform.",1
"We're also seeing significant iOS traction with large enterprise platforms which are the face of complex back-end systems to tens of millions of employees around the world. The end user employee experience is vital to engagement and productivity and with increasing mobility of today's modern workforce, those experiences are best on native iOS applications.",1
"We're also seeing traction with other mission-critical airline functions in ground operations and flight maintenance. For example, one of the largest airlines in the world tells us that the adoption of iPad has cut maintenance delays in half. Apple services are also making their way onboard, including growing adoption of Apple Pay for food and beverage purchases and in-flight access to Apple Music.",1
"Aviation is a strong example of this strategy at work. Across 450 airlines, iPad is overwhelmingly the preferred solution for the pilot's electronic flight bag. We've been making great progress expanding Apple's footprint beyond the cockpit into the cabin, where more than half of the top 50 airlines have now implemented iOS to enhance the guest experience as well as enable a new use case with mobile point-of-sale.",1
"Turning to our retail and online stores. We generated very strong double-digit revenue growth from Apple Watch and iPad. We also announced 50 new Today at Apple sessions during the quarter in three new and expanded formats Skills, Walks and Labs free at our stores around the world. We're making important progress in the enterprise market, helping transform major industries. We're building on Apple's leading position in key functional areas to expand our reach and share within large accounts.",1
"Yes, Katy. And keep in mind by the way, we are reporting this guidance including a 300 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, so actually in constant currency the numbers would be even stronger.",1
"As Tim said, March was the strongest month of the quarter on a year-over-year basis and so this has given the confidence to provide the guidance that you've seen. Geographically, of course, as you've seen from our results for the March quarter, China is the geo where we found some challenges, but we believe the trajectory should improve over time.",1
"And so the Apple Arcade will serve some of that market. And it serves it with a different kind of game, which we think will be great for developers and great for users. The TV+ product plays in a market where it's -- there's a huge move from the cable bundle to over the top.",1
"So, I guess, the question is and I know some of these services aren't even live yet but should we expect a continuation of the building out of new services categories like what we saw at the March event? Is there a pipeline of new services in the works? Or have we kind of seen what we're likely to see on that front for the near to intermediate term? And then I have a follow-up.",1
The installments are different in each geography. I would say that at the moment the geography that is doing the best in installments would be China. And we have a bit of a unique offering there I think versus the -- versus what you can get in the regular market and so that probably further helps there. And so you can bet that we're learning on each of these finding the parts that the user likes the most.,1
I think the key is we're trying to build a -- build something into the consumer mindset that it's good for the environment and good for them to trade in their current device on a new device. And we do our best of getting the current device to someone else that can use that or in some cases if the product is at an end of life we are recycling the parts on it to make sure that it can carry on in another form.,1
Thanks for the color Tim. And as my follow-up Luca can you just clarify if the settlement with Qualcomm is creating either a headwind or a tailwind to your gross margins in the near-term? And does your guidance contemplate incremental pricing actions that could be creating some gross margin headwinds? Thank you.,1
"As Tim has explained we've reach this comprehensive agreement with Qualcomm. As part of this we have agreed that we're not going to share the financial terms of the agreement, so we plan to honor that. What you see in our gross margin guidance for the June quarter we guided 37% to 38% fully comprehends the outcome of the agreement with Qualcomm.",1
"Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question please?",1
"Thanks for taking my question. So, you have more than 1.4 billion active devices and at your event you announced services that leverage that installed base. And you have obviously a remarkable position with kind of this Trojan horse of devices out in so many households.",1
"Yes, I wouldn't want to get into announcing things on the call, but obviously, we're always working on new things. And -- but we're right now we're really focused on getting these four out there. We have the News+ in the market today. We'll have the Apple Arcade and the Apple TV+ products in the market in the fall and Apple Card will go out in the summer timeframe. And so we've got lots in front of us and we're very excited about getting these out there.",1
"Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, Shannon said you're not going to talk specifics around the timing of the 5G phone, but Tim maybe you can talk about how the company approaches a new technology like this given the higher cost but also potentially significant benefit, how you think about the right timing for coming to market with a product, with those characteristics? And then just generally how meaningful you think 5G is as a demand driver for upgrades in your iPhone installed base? Thank you.",1
Right. And then you mentioned the App Store search ad business a couple of times in the prepared remarks. Is that reaching a point where it's become material and maybe moving the needle for overall services revenue? Or is there anything you can quantify related to that? I also imagine that this is a high-margin business at least maybe higher than the overall Services margin but wondering if you can confirm if that's the case or not. Thanks.,1
"It's growing very, very fast Mike. I think it was up around 70% over the previous year. We're expanding into new geographies as well and we still have more geographies out there that we think can move the dial further. So, it is a -- it's definitely a business that is big and getting bigger.",1
A â Nancy Paxton,1
Our next question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital Markets.,1
"Okay and thank you for taking my question. Tim, when you look at the four things that you have announced. And I realize they have different dates when they're coming out but, which ones would you say over the next 12 months has the most potential to help your Services line? And then maybe, which one has the best long-term potential? And then, I have a quick follow-up.",1
We're going to wait until we get these things out. And what I can tell you right now is that the -- we're taking sort of consumer interest on the Apple Card and there's been a significant level of interest on that and we're excited. As you know the -- gaming is the top category on the App Store.,1
In terms of the incentives we're offering currently in our retail stores a trade-in value that has -- that is more than the sort of the blue book of the device if you will for lack of a better description. And so we have topped those up to provide an extra benefit to the user.,1
"We're -- actually the product that's being traded in is all over the place, to be honest. It's 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus and then fewer 8 and 8 Plus. But there's some of each of those and so you get customers that are on the two-year cycle and customers -- some customers on the one-year cycle and then customers as well on the three and four-year cycles. And so it's really all over the place.",1
"Hi. Yes. Thank you. Tim, you shared a lot of color around trade-ins, but I was also hoping maybe you can characterize what sort of dynamics you're seeing across your installed base on these trade-ins. What type of devices are being traded in? Is the profile of someone who has a really old iPhone? Or are you seeing folks that have newer iPhones trading in? And what sort of incentives are you providing beyond sort of the financing to drive that? And do you see this as something that can accelerate replacement cycles here over the next year or so? And I have a follow-up.",1
The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.,1
"Thank you, Jim. We have the next question, please.",1
"Thank you so much, gentlemen.",1
"And Jim, if I may add on the gross margin level as we look at pricing actions, of course, anytime you do a pricing action it is gross margin percentage diluted. But what really matters to us and what we look at -- when we look at the elasticity of these programs is to see the impact on our gross margin dollars. And what -- the experience that we've had in a few of these emerging markets has been positive in that respect and so that's what we think matters the most really.",1
"And then finally -- and this is not to be under weighted either -- I think the improved trade dialogue between the countries affects consumer confidence in a positive way. And so, I think it's sort of the sum of all of those things.",1
"The other two items that are not insignificant in China that I don't want to lose here is that the stimulus programs, I believe, are having an effect on the consumer. And the one that I got much visibility in -- that happened in early April was the VAT reduction from 16% to 13%, so it's a very aggressive move. But there are other stimulus programs as well that likely have an effect to the consumer level.",1
"Clearly, what we've learned here and it's not a surprise really is that the -- many, many people do want to trade-in their current phone. It does -- from a customer user point of view the trade-in looks like a subsidy, and so it is a way to offset the device cost itself. And many people in literally every market that we've tried this in, there is a reasonable number of people that want to take and pay for something on installments instead of all at once. And so, it's a little different in each market in terms of what the elasticity is, but you can bet that we're learning quickly on all of those.",1
"Yeah. Jim, in the opening remarks I was really talking about China specifically. And I mentioned four things that I believe are responsible for the better year-over-year performance in the Q2 relative to Q1 and also the final weeks of March being better than the Q2 average. And those four are the price reductions, but that's one of them. But there are three others and one of the others is the trade-in and financing programs that we instituted in our retail stores.",1
"In your opening remarks, Tim, you'd mentioned about pricing adjustments that you made in some of the markets and then Luca talked also about the strength of the trade-in program or maybe it was Tim also. Can you help us understand about what type of lessons or elasticity you've learned about pricing and the trade-in programs of how it impacts like revenues and COGS and margins and things? Thank you.",1
"Thank you very much. A topic that's probably split or shared by both Tim and Luca on a response, but I'll ask the question and you can decide how to divide it up.",1
Jim Suva from Citi has our next question.,1
"Thank you, Katy. So we have the next question, please.",1
"On the flip side of that there's a number of things in the commodity markets going in the other direction at the moment like DRAM and NAND. And so it's difficult to project what happens next, but it's the aggregate of all of it that really matters from a price point of view.",1
"Katy, this is one that I'm going to largely punt on as you would probably guess. We look at a lot of things on the different technologies and try to look at the -- and select the right time that things come together and get those into products as soon as we can. And the -- certainly from a cost point of view there has been -- the technologies have had cost pressure over the last couple of years or so.",1
"Sure. In the March quarter, our gross margin was 37.5%. It was at the low end of our range. We had a few items that on balance resulted in us reporting at the low end. They included mix, in particular, selling more iPads than we had planned, including getting iPad mini into our four- to six-week channel inventory range, some changes in our service policies that required us to make provisions for prior quarter sales, and we had some unfavorable adjustments. As I look forward to the June quarter, weâre guiding gross margin to be down between 50 basis points and 150 basis points sequentially. We see two factors impacting gross margin sequentially. First and the largest of the two is the loss of leverage on sequentially lower revenue; and second, a different product mix. We expect both of these headwinds to be partially offset by better cost in the quarter.",1
(Operator Instructions) First weâll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
Thank you Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report March quarter results that exceeded our guidance for both revenues and earnings.,1
Can you please repeat the statistics you gave on market share for the iPods?,1
I don't have anything new to share with you beyond what we've recently put out and you can find that on the website. I'm sorry.,1
Your next question comes from Ingrid Ebeling - JMP Securities.,1
A couple things on the iPhone. Can you give an update on the timing of the iPhone outside the United States?,1
Yes. We still plan to be in Europe in the fourth calendar quarter of this year and we continue to plan to be in Asia in 2008.,1
"In terms of distribution in the U.S. with the iPhone, it will be exclusive with AT&T Cingular and Apple, or will other Cingular partners be distributing the product such as Best Buy or Radio Shack or what not?",1
"It will be sold through Cingular stores, the Cingular.com, Apple.com and Apple retail stores.",1
"Sure. What I said was that the U.S. is over 70%, Australia and Canada are over 60%, Japan and Hong Kong are over 50%, the U.K., Switzerland, Singapore, and Denmark are over 40%. All of those data points are GFK data points, I think, with the exception of the U.S., which is MPD.",1
"But we view this as a seasonality issue and not an iPod specific issue. As Tim has commented now twice, we couldn't be happier with our market share results.",1
Your next question comes from Ben Boland - Cleveland Research.,1
"I was hoping to get a better understanding of the internal design strategy. Given the more favorable component pricing environment, substantial price declines you've seen in the NAND flash over the last several quarters, has that had an influence on how you look at product design and kind of what you look at in terms of introducing in the future?",1
"Ben, as you know, we don't really comment on our future product plans.",1
"Could you give us a read on what percent of industry music sales were digital in the quarter? I think last quarter it was around 11% or 12%. Could you say where that's trending now? As that grows as a percentage of total music sales, could you explain if there's any influence to the royalty rates you pay to the music companies?",1
"We do not talk about our agreements with the music companies so I'm sorry, we can't help you there. I've not seen the most recent quarterâs digital percent of total sales, but the trend is going up. Here in the United States our market share of legally purchased and downloaded music is over 85%. We're seeing very strong growth on the iTunes music store I think based upon its great merchandising and its seamless integration with the iPod.",1
What was depreciation in the quarter?,1
"On the iTunes store, can you give us any kind of milestone update of where you stand on number of music and video downloads to date?",1
"For the iPod, as I commented before, the June quarter is usually seasonally the weakest from a consumer perspective. Last year we saw iPod sales decline sequentially from the March to June quarters despite there being some constraints in the beginning of the March quarter. This year we were in good supply and demand balance throughout the March quarter and so we'd expect to see a bigger sequential decline.",1
"We don't get into reporting that level of product detail, but if you look at the ASPs from the December to the March quarter, you'll see they were relatively flat.",1
"I'll repeat some of the things I said before and then add a few other things. On the Mac point of view, we're growing at a significant multiple of the market in the U.S., in Europe and in Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific is our fastest-growing region. It grew at 89% year over year. The IDC projection for Asia Pacific was only 14%. That's over six times the market. I mentioned before the U.S. and Europe numbers, and so essentially in every major geography outside of Japan, the Mac is growing at a multiple of the market and not just for one quarter, but in fact, a substantial number of quarters as I'd mentioned before.",1
"Our philosophy has been to run the music store just a little bit over breakeven because we think that selling music and now videos, helps us to sell iPods and accessories. So that's been our strategy and Tim just walked you through some of the results and the growth that we've seen around the world in iPod. I think the strategy is working extremely well.",1
Your next question comes from Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest.,1
"On the channel side, could you give an update on the direct sales versus the indirect mix? Did the mix of direct versus indirect help margin in the quarter?",1
"Bill, the direct sales, which we define as sales through the retail stores, online, direct to education and enterprise customers and through the music store, were 50% in the quarter and that was reasonably close to our expectations.",1
"Also on the iPod, if I could ask another question, you've been thinking about revenue by geography and the opportunity for iPod outside the United States. Could you give some additional color on how the iPod did outside the U.S. and how it did versus your expectations? And sort of the same thing for the Mac, as well?",1
"I see the revenue and things like that by geography, but if you could add additional color on the product side, even directionally, that would be helpful.",1
"As we've gotten out of the Intel transition, in fact, we've been over three times the market growth for the last three quarters. September was 30%, December was 28%, March was 36%. We're doing really, really well.",1
"Let me start with your Mac and iPod question. For Macs, sales have typically increased from the March to June quarters, but at lower ASPs as a result of the education buying season beginning. The June quarter typically sees higher K-12 sales, while the September quarter tends to see stronger higher education sales. But the June and September quarters are really our bigger education selling seasons.",1
"On the iPod, like the Mac, we're doing very well outside the U.S. I covered briefly some of the share numbers, but we're now over 60% in Australia and Canada in share, we continue to be over 50% in Japan, we've now gone over 50% in Hong Kong, we are in the 40% to 50% range in the U.K., in Switzerland, in Singapore, in Denmark. We hit a high in Germany of 28% in the most recent numbers. So pretty much everywhere you look on a year-over-year basis, you would see really good progress. We are very pleased with it.",1
"One more question on the Mac, if I could. Do you expect the Mac Pro to have a positive effect on Mac ASPs here in the upcoming quarter at all?",1
"Bill, we don't forecast ASPs or product level results, but as Tim commented, we're very excited about our new Mac Pro introduction and all the Apple and developer software that goes with it. So we certainly are expecting good things going forward.",1
Your next question comes from Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners.,1
"A follow-up on the earlier question about seasonality. I think over the last couple quarters, you've given some seasonality on both the iPod and the Macs. Maybe you could help us understand that a little bit better for the June quarter in terms of what the normal declines or increases would be?",1
"Also, is the Leopard push out any part of the reason why you might be being more cautious on the Mac side of things?",1
I don't have that handy. Maybe Nancy can grab it. Why don't we go to the next question and I'll give it to you in the next answer.,1
Your next question comes from Shaw Wu - American Technology.,1
"First on Japan. Japan continues to somewhat lag, it's been flat three quarters in a row. What's going on there, and what are you going to do to address it?",1
"Sales of desktops grew 37%, driven by strong demand for the iMac, as well as increased sales of Mac Pro, which we updated in January.",1
"We saw healthy growth in all regions, with the U.S. sales growing 40% and international sales growing 47%.",1
"Sales in our 208 retail stores, most of which are in the U.S., were extremely strong, growing 74% year over year, driven in part by traffic of 33.7 million visitors, up 57% from the year-ago quarter.",1
"In the retail stores, 50% of the CPUs we sold were to customers who were new to the Mac, adding growth to our platform.",1
"And finally, our U.S. education business generated Mac unit growth of 35% year over year, its highest growth rate in any quarter in the last eight years.",1
"I would now like to talk about our Mac products and services, which represented 59% of total quarterly revenue. We are extremely pleased to have shipped 2.29 million Macs, just shy of the record number of Macs we sold this past holiday quarter and representing 51% growth over the prior March quarterâs results.",1
"This is a 3.5 times the overall PC market rate of growth for the March quarter based on the latest forecast published by IDC, up from the 2 to 3 times market growth rate we have been reporting almost every quarter for the last three years.",1
"Sales of portables grew 61%, driven by continued strong demand for Macbook and Macbook Pros, both of which were refreshed during the quarter, as well as the successful launch of the Macbook Air. Macbook Air represents a new portable category for Apple and customers have responded very well to its breakthrough design and ultra portability.",1
"On your expenses, Peter, you are guiding expenses up quite a bit sequentially. You talked about iPhone related expenses. A little more color in terms of what types of programs and promotions you plan to do there?",1
"Now I would like to discuss our music products and services, which accounted for 36% of total revenue during the quarter. We sold 10.6 million iPods, an increase of 1% from the year-ago quarter, and we experienced about the same seasonal rate of decline between the December and March quarters as we did last year.",1
iPod revenue grew 8% year over year from higher ASPs in every geographic segment due to the success of the iPod Touch. We continue to be very pleased with customer response to the iPod Touch and believe the introduction of the software development kit in late June will broaden this appeal even further as great new applications are developed.,1
"After declining 17% year over year in the December quarter, Shuffle sales were also down significantly in the March quarter but the weekly rate of sales improved considerably following the February 19th price reduction.",1
"We continue to achieve our objectives of maintaining our high MP3 market share in the U.S. and gaining share internationally. Our share of the U.S. MP3 market was 73% according to the latest data published by NPD. Outside the U.S., we gained share in nearly every market we have data for based on the latest information from GFK and BCN.",1
Sales from iTunes were very strong in the quarter and NPD reported that we have surpassed Wal-Mart to become the largest music retailer in the U.S. The iTunes store has over 50 million customers and over 85% share of the U.S. market for legally purchased and downloaded music based on the latest information from Nielsen Soundscan.,1
Our movie rental service has been well-received by customers and we have also just begun selling TV shows in Germany and will continue to expand video content internationally.,1
"Before going through the details of the March quarter, I would like to give you a few data points indicating just how exceptionally well Apple performed. Revenue growth in the March quarter accelerated to 43% year over year, which is more than twice the 21% growth rate we achieved in the March quarter last year.",1
"Operating margin for the quarter was better than expected at 17.5%, primarily due to the higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin. Net income was $1.05 billion, which was up 36% over the prior March quarterâs results and translated to earnings per share of $1.16.",1
"Thank you, Nancy and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the highest March quarter revenue and earnings in Apple's history. Revenue in the March quarter was $7.51 billion, an increase of more than $2.2 billion over the previous March quarterâs revenue of $5.26 billion. The tremendous growth in the quarter was driven by very strong demand for Macs, higher revenue from iPod and iTunes and the continued popularity of the iPhone.",1
"And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2007, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2008, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release.",1
"Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today may consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts.",1
"Good day, everyone and welcome to this Apple Incorporated second quarter 2008 quarterly results conference call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.",1
Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896 and financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan's at 408-974-4570 and I'm at 408-974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.,1
"A replay of today's call will be available as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone. The number for the telephone replay is 719-457-0820. Confirmation code is 8958004. These replays will be available beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific time today.",1
"We're not making financial projections at an individual product line and Chris, we have not yet shipped the product. So we're very excited about iPhone and bringing our great hardware and software design capabilities to this market. We believe that we can really delight customers and we can't wait to launch the products and have customers get their hands on it.",1
"I apologize, I must have had a bad piece of data there from last call. Second question relates to cash margins on iPhone versus the company average or versus the iPod. Is it fair to say that you expect the iPhone to have higher cash margins than the core business?",1
"Chris, we started the quarter in the three to four week range. We ended in the three to four week range and the absolute number of units were very similar from beginning to end.",1
"It looks like Mac channel inventory levels were down a bit versus last quarter. Can you quantify the impact of that inventory reduction on Mac unit sales during the quarter? Secondly, is there any reason why you're taking those inventory levels down?",1
The final question today will come from Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank.,1
"Shaw, let me first answer Ben's question, the depreciation and amortization in the March quarter was about $69 million. In terms of OpEx, we remain very confident in our business and products. We're continuing to invest for long-term growth, including this quarter in the launching of the iPhone in late June and Apple TV this past quarter. We are increasing spending in our engineering areas, our retail stores, and also increasing other marketing and advertising programs, and of course, seeing some increased expenses related to the higher revenue and stock-based compensation.",1
"We have a number of things going with the channels on merchandising, we're running Macintosh, the Mac/PC ad on television, so we have a series of things that we're doing to try to turn things around. It is literally the only major market in the world that we're not doing well in. It is very frustrating.",1
"In terms of Japan it is a very challenging market for us. The Japan PC market according to IDC contracted by 2% last quarter. That's identical to what we did in terms of iPod and the MP3 market, we've maintained an over 50% share for some time; however, the MP3 market itself isn't growing, so our units as a consequence are growing very small single-digit. That coupled with an ASP decline in iPod produces a negative revenue compare year over year.",1
"On the new EMI deal you guys announced this quarter, assuming some of the other labels follow suit and you reach the target that Steve had mentioned for the end of the year for DRM-free music, will the economics of iTunes change in any way from a margin perspective, given the increased price for higher quality tracks?",1
"Were there any significant changes in the mix between HDD and flash-based iPods this quarter versus last? Obviously, I'm only looking for a qualitative answer there.",1
"We sold 1.7 million iPhones during the March quarter and expanded our sales presence to include Austria and Ireland. Total revenue recognized during the quarter from sales of iPhone, iPhone accessories, and payments from carriers was $378 million. Total deferred revenue from iPhone and Apple TV was $1.93 billion at the end of the March quarter, compared to $1.44 billion at the end of the December quarter.",1
"The reason that we are going to also account for Apple TV on a subscription basis is we want to provide periodically to our customers, software updates. We have a number of ideas for Apple TV. We'll provide those to customers as they become available. That's why we're doing this. This is a relatively new market, much like the iPod was a number of years ago. We're very excited about it over the future, and have a number of ideas.",1
"The accessories will be accounted for on a period basis rather than a subscription basis, is that fair?",1
"Peter, just in terms of attach rate on the hardware, is there a good number to use? Should we assume an incremental $5 or so for the services?",1
Harry I'm not able to make any comments beyond what I've said about the relationship with AT&T and we also plan to sell accessories with the iPhone as we do with our iPods.,1
"On the cash balance of $15 billion, from a shareholder perspective, it isn't a good use of capital as you well know to have that level of cash with low returns. So one of the things we've started to see with other tech companies is some leveraging the balance sheet to buy back stock. Any plans to do anything with the cash at this point?",1
"First of all, we ended the March quarter with $12.6 billion in cash. I don't have a change in our position to share with you today. We continue to retain our cash for our flexibility to invest in the business and we do discuss share buyback and other forms of returning cash to the shareholders with the board from time to time.",1
"Sorry, I meant $15. Lastly back on the Apple TV subscription agreement, is this a prelude to actually moving to a subscription model to the end user? Is that where you're setting the stage for subscription accounting on the TV product at this point?",1
"Sure, but you don't charge for the iPod on a subscription basis, so anyway.",1
"Peter, I want to circle back on the subscription accounting again. At a high level, if we take the price points you guys have initially indicated of about $500 and take the 24-month straight line, if you guys were to receive the entire hardware value of that, that would be about $21 a month. First of all, is that roughly the right number to assume per unit? Or $60 a quarter? Or how much higher or lower in general should we be assuming for the hardware and the software? Hardware and the service, I should say.",1
"Two questions please. How should we think about the potential for a push out of iPod in front of the iPhone launch as people try to decide between one product or the other? In the same vein, how are you thinking about the impact, the delay in Leopard might have on Mac sales in the June and September quarters?",1
"On the iPod question, the only thing I can say for certain is that in the data last quarter there was no obvious effect from iPhone on iPod. We'll just have to see how this quarter goes. In terms of Leopard, we are shipping the best Macs we've ever shipped. The upgrade to Leopard is very simple and straightforward to do, but I am really not sure whether customers will delay or not.",1
"Given the amount of time between the iPhone announcement and the launch, does that give you any advantage as far as being able to ramp in volume before the end of June?",1
"We've been focusing very heavily on the production capability of iPhone and as you know, we bring a lot of experience into this. We did 21 million iPods in the first fiscal quarter and so we've got that same level of expertise that we're putting in place for iPhone, but I wouldn't want to predict the ramp at this point.",1
Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes â UBS.,1
"Are you going to take preorders for iPhone? Do you know yet, Peter or Tim?",1
"On the iPhone hand set the factors will relate to we're going to ship two models, one at $499, one at $599. We're going to sell some direct and we will sell some indirect. Those are variables that you would want to think about. We also will sell accessories, as I indicated and I expect to receive payments from AT&T Cingular. We will report those to you each quarter on our data summary.",1
Your next question comes from Harry Blount â Lehman Brothers.,1
Your next question comes from Bill Shope â JP Morgan.,1
"Now looking forward, we are likely to see other factors which will drive gross margin down, such as a different commodity environment or product mix. We do not see the current gross margin levels as sustainable and donât want you to count on them.",1
"The commodity environment last quarter was favorable as we thought it would be when we spoke in January. However, it was even more favorable than we had predicted, particularly in the memory area. This quarter we see some commodities moving from an oversupply condition to more of a supply/demand balanced position, particularly NAND Flash and memory in general.",1
"Lastly, could I get the Cap Ex for the quarter?",1
We had $105 million in capital for the March quarter.,1
Your next question comes from Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray.,1
"Good afternoon. Back to the component pricing question, obviously you guys don't really have a history of really passing on significant benefits of the price environment to the customers and obviously the price environment might even increase a little bit for the component side. Is it safe to say if you essentially maintain your pricing of your products that you should be having margins consistent? I know mix is in there too, but gross margins consistent with the 35% level.",1
"Gene, for the June quarter I've guided gross margins to 32%. While I'm doing that for June, I would continue to target gross margin in the 27% to 28% range on a longer term basis, despite our recent results which have benefitted from a number of factors, including a very favorable commodity environment.",1
"I understand you don't want us to count on them, but from a theory basis, if the pricing does stay relatively low and you guys basically maintain the pricing of your products, I know you typically lower the price of the iPods once or twice a year; but just generally maintain the price of the products, could we draw the conclusion, letâs say those factors happen, that the margins should be higher than 32%?",1
I haven't started ramp yet so I don't want to predict what our supply would be.,1
"Well again, as I commented and Tim can add on, we see commodity pricing trending up in June. We are now entering our education buying season. The June quarter tends to be more dominated by K-12 which tends to buy our lower ASP products and we have, in fact, repriced our display line.",1
"Historically, you guys have a phenomenon of introducing a product and there being supply constraints. Do you have any idea, I know the iPhone will come out in June, but do you think it be widely available in June or is it going to be relatively few units in June? Any color on that front?",1
"It's very difficult to tell what the demand is until you're actually shipping the product. I think all of us have many anecdotal stories to tell, but there seems to be an enormous amount of people waiting for it and talking about it. We really need to start shipping and make the product available for sale before we can do a reasonable job of predicting demand.",1
Did AT&T say they have a million orders for the iPhone?,1
AT&T is not taking orders. They have a million people who are interested that have signed up on the website.,1
Do you think you could fulfill a million in the June quarter?,1
We're currently not taking them. We will announce later the date at which we'll begin taking orders.,1
"Typically your retail staff are waiting for new products much like we are, they don't know what's coming. With regard to the iPhone, is it different and are they going through training right now and/or soon to learn how to sell this whole new phone and whole new offering from Apple? Is there an investment on your part so they're ready on day one? Thatâs kind of unprecedented. Anything you can talk about there would be helpful.",1
"There's a number of things that are different. Generally speaking, as you know, we keep products very secret until they're announced. Sometimes that limits the amount of planning that can take place on the product. iPhone is uniquely different there in that we announced it in January, and so the retail store personnel are putting a lot of energy into planning for the launch right now.",1
Your next question comes from Richard Gardner â Citigroup.,1
"We have a long standing practice of not releasing specific gross margins; however, the corporate gross margin was over 35%, which exceeded our guidance. iPod was key in achieving that result.",1
"I understand your policy of not specific gross margins, but historically you've given a range it was obviously much lower than it is now, at above or below 20% and you have made relative comments; so can you at least provide any further details on a relative basis, Peter?",1
What I can tell you is that both our Mac and iPod hardware margins were quite strong in the quarter. They've both benefited from a very favorable commodity environment; but also we had better service costs and leverage from the revenue and a good mix.,1
"On the R&D side, your revenues have been growing at about 20% a quarter. Your R&D expense has been remarkably flat for the last six quarters. Is there an inflection point or a bend, particularly with some of the ostensible increased functionality that you're going to hope to bring in the form of software to both your Apple TV platform and your phone offerings? Should we be expecting an inflection point in R&D and why hasn't it gone up somewhat commensurately with sales, especially given all the new product initiatives that you have?",1
"First of all, we are very confident in not only in what we plan to do with iPhone and Apple TV, but also OS 10 and our applications. We have just fantastic folks in our software and hardware engineering areas. In the last quarter or so, we have capitalized our software development. I talked about that in my prepared remarks. So that played into this quarter.",1
"The R&D as a percent of our revenue was 3% this quarter. It had been running at 4%, and without the capitalization you would have seen a trend that was similar to the past. The dollars are going up, just along with our revenue. We're going to continue to invest in our business, particularly in engineering and you'll continue to see our spending go up and I think continue to see just a great flow of products from the team.",1
"I wanted to go back to the earlier question, Peter, on passing favorable component prices through to customers. I realize it's been your longstanding practice to do this when you introduce these new products, but I was wondering why you wouldn't make an exception in an environment like the one that we're in, in the first quarter, where you had dramatic declines in prices? Is it because you don't believe that there would be enough elasticity there to justify it? Or is it because of the intricacies of managing price protection and channel inventories and so forth? What is your strategy there?",1
"So they'll be fully trained and aware of the all features and everything right off day one and have it all ready to go is what you're saying, basically?",1
"We believe our products are very competitively priced. If you look at the Mac, we grew at 36% year over year, this is over three times the industry growth. If you look at it by geo it's even more incredible. The IDC was projecting a 4% growth rate for the U.S. We grew in the Americas at 36%, so nine to ten times. IDC was projecting 5% for Europe, we grew at 38%. This is now the ninth quarter out of the past ten that the Mac has grown over the market. The Mac seems to have enormous momentum.",1
"If you look at iPod and look at the share that we have, we're over 70% in the U.S., we're over 60% in Australia and Canada, we're over 50% in Japan and Hong Kong, and really growing on a year-over-year basis in most of Western Europe. We feel we're very competitively priced.",1
Your next question comes from Richard Farmer â Merrill Lynch.,1
Richard Farmer â Merrill Lynch,1
"This is a little bit of a follow-up in variation on that question and the gross margin question, but more specifically with respect to the iPod hardware business. When you talk about the factors affecting gross margin, you mentioned the education mix, the component pricing, and the display price cuts. Are there any other factors within the iPod hardware business specifically outside of the component price environment that you mentioned that would influence your gross margin guidance? I'm thinking of things like price changes or feature capacity increases, or significant mix changes maybe within the iPod line that would cause your gross margin outlook to change outside of components? Thanks.",1
"I'm sorry, I can't help you there. We have a longstanding practice of not talking about future products and I've given you my view of why I think gross margin will decline sequentially.",1
"I also have a question about margins. I know historically you've qualitatively discussed about margins between relative categories in your business, so specifically on a qualitative basis, could you help us understand if iPod hardware margins, so just the hardware portion of iPod was higher than your Mac hardware margins this quarter?",1
"That is true, but really underneath this, what you're seeing is that the June quarter is not as strong from a consumer perspective. We had a really strong March quarter. I think you may see a bit more pronounced effect this year going from March to June in part upon what we saw from the consumer sales in March and heading into the education buying season.",1
"Is the second point any different from normal seasonality though? In the sense that don't you always see that and accordingly, if we're comparing this quarter versus previous quarters, why would that be any notably different?",1
"Second, it's the beginning of the education buying season, which typically sees higher K-12 purchases in the June quarter and at lower ASPs.",1
"We are guiding revenue down slightly sequentially as a result of a couple factors. First last year, iPod sales declined sequentially from the March to June quarters despite supply being constrained at the beginning of the March quarter. This year, we were in a good supply and demand balance in the March quarter, so we would expect to see a bigger sequential decline. We see this as a market seasonality issue and not an iPod specific issue. We are very pleased with our market share.",1
"Typically your revenues from Q2 to Q3 are flat to slightly up. You're guiding for them to be down, despite tremendous enthusiasm for the iPhone, for your Mac lineup which you just mentioned on the aforementioned question, and your confidence in the iPod line. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes for revenue in your revenue guidance for next quarter?",1
Your next question comes from Tony Sakanagi - Sanford Bernstein.,1
"However, with the Creative Suite shipping and the announcements that we made last week at NAD with Final Cut Studio and the announcements we made just a few weeks with the 8-core Mac Pro we believe that we have got an incredible lineup for our Pro customers and believe they will be very excited to get their hands on them.",1
"We do believe that our Pro customers have been stalling and delaying purchase. One key reason is the Creative Suite. It has just started shipping, as you know. Generally speaking, what we've seen in the past in this area is that people, companies will buy a few units and test those and then subsequently do rollouts. It's really too early to tell what occurs in here.",1
"Lastly, have you seen any uptick in the Creative Professional segment yet from Adobe CS3, or is that still coming?",1
"In terms of overall Mac point of sales, we've been working on this worldwide and the Mac point of sales have moved from 5,800 to 8,000 on a year-over-year basis.",1
"I don't have an update on Circuit City pilot. We are evaluating right now the results of it, and I believe we will be making a decision on that this quarter.",1
"As you pointed out, we started with Best Buy with a half dozen or so stores; we then took it to over 50 and we have just announced taking it over to 200 which will take place by the fall. We're very, very excited to do that. We'll be doing some unique merchandising things with them that we're excited about.",1
"Lastly on Mac distribution, any updates with regard to the Best Buy relationship? They said it was going up to 200. You were at 10 with Circuit City. Any more distribution partners youâd like to talk about or any progress you'd like to update us on?",1
We have award winning support that we provide today on the Mac and iPod and we're going at the iPhone with the same rigor.,1
What about customer support on the back end? Is there a significant investment that you guys are making right now? Do you think you'll have fully staffed support for the product on your end?,1
They're putting a lot of energy in getting ready for the launch.,1
We are very pleased with iPhone momentum and customer feedback continues to be outstanding. We remain confident in achieving our goal of selling 10 million iPhones in calendar 2008.,1
"Developer response to the iPhone 2.0 beta software we announced on March 6th has been tremendous. Over 200,000 developers have signed up and downloaded the software development kit. Interest in the iPhone enterprise beta program has also been off the charts. We have received applications from over one-third of the Fortune 500 and over 400 higher ed institutions. Hundreds of companies and institutions have been accepted into the program and more are being added each week.",1
"In closing, we are pleased with our record March quarter revenue and record March quarter iPhone and iPad sales. Weâre very proud of the breadth and depth of our tremendous ecosystem and our new all-time record for iTunes sales. We are also in the fortunate position to be able to more than double our return of capital program to $100 billion with the larger share repurchase authorization in history and to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world with annual payments of about $11 billion. We remain very confident in our product pipeline.",1
"So our business performed exceptionally well in the March quarter across each of our customer segments, including our retail stores.",1
"To be specific here, favorable does not mean that it goes lower than where it was in March. It means that we envision it trading in a fairly narrow trading range and therefore not increasing that much as we head into the quarter. But I donât believe that it will go lower because as you say, many people are already charging -- certainly not absorbing all of their fixed cost in the current prices.",1
Weâll move to Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns.,1
"Just a couple of quick things; one, on OI&E, is there anything aside from lower interest rates, given your cash flows, leading to a lower number? Two, can you give us a sense about what the delay in the iPhone recognition meant to the current quarter? Three, the tax rate, can you clarify whether it was down this quarter and this 31%, do we use that going forward? And last, just in terms of as you look at the consumer, obviously you had great numbers but are you seeing any impact on the consumer, are you taking steps to address that -- can you just talk about consumer behavior in general?",1
"I may not get all of your questions so if I forget one, remind me and Iâll certainly come back to it. Iâm going to actually just probably go in reverse order.",1
"In terms of the consumer, we had a very good December quarter and we had an amazing March quarter and I in my prepared remarks wanted to go through some things that I thought would be helpful to you, and I think in a prior question I did, but Iâll go back through just a couple of them.",1
"Particularly in the U.S., our revenues in the United States grew 40% year over year; Mac shipments were up 51% in the U.S., basically at the level we saw around the world; and we saw about 34 million people in our 208 retail stores, most of which were in the U.S.",1
"In terms of the tax rate, we had been forecasting 32% for the year. With a higher mix of foreign earnings that we saw in the March quarter and lower interest income really as a result of the rate environment, our tax rate for the year looks to be 31%, and so thatâs what we are forecasting for the June quarter and for the September quarter. And so in order to get the 31% for the year, we had an adjustment in the March quarter and that is why the tax rate was 29%.",1
"And so we did receive significant benefit, particularly in the DRAM and NAND Flash areas.",1
"And then I know that you had an OI&E question which I am going to let Gary answer, but was there one other before I turn it over to Gary?",1
"Just the impact of the iPhone recognition in the current quarter, is there some way to quantify what that was?",1
"Well, youâll have to make your estimates but we sold 1.7 million phones during the quarter. We made the announcement on March 6th. You know what we sell the phones for and we recognize the revenue over 24 months. Gary.",1
"Just to clarify then, the number that you sold, that is still in the -- I just want to make sure I understand it. So that of the -- after March 6th, if you sold, you still counted them as shipments; you just donât show the revenue is what you are saying?",1
"And Gary, just on the OI&E?",1
"I think you asked if there was anything else in the OI&E besides lower effective yields, and the answer is no. We are basically investing in a very short dated, high quality, highly liquid instruments and as consequence, the yield on our portfolio has dropped a little bit, 4.9% a quarter ago. We exited the last quarter -- we were earning about 3.9% and we expect it to go down a little bit more. And there wasnât any material write-offs in the portfolio. In regard to investments and auction rate securities and asset-backed securities, we donât have any of those.",1
"And if I could follow-up, Tim, with one other question; you mentioned that you said that you thought that memory pricing would continue to be very favorable in the June quarter and yet in the case of both DRAM and NAND, weâre at very, very low levels and in many cases for many suppliers, close to cash costs. What gives you confidence that the pricing will continue to be favorable here as we go into the second quarter and you and other companies start to procure more DRAM and NAND for typical seasonal build?",1
"Iâd just add, Rich, that the component advantages as you said were large during the quarter, and those really offset most of the later points that Peter talked about, which were the Shuffle price cut, the international price cuts that we did to adjust for currency, the higher mix of iTunes sales, and the lower overall revenue and the effect it has on the structure.",1
"And fourth, we will see the full quarter impact of the iPod Shuffle and some international price reductions that we took in February.",1
"Great, thanks.",1
We will move to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Good afternoon. I want to go back to the margin question because this is the first quarter that both growth and operating margins are down year-on-year since March of â06. Peter, do you feel that you now need to reinvest some of the margin upside to address the growth opportunities internationally and in some of the new product categories, such that year-on-year declines will be more of the norm going forward? Or was there something specific in the calendar for first quarter that will go away later this year?",1
"Katy, again when we gave you our guidance in January, we gave guidance for 32% gross margin and we reported 32.9, so we did better than we thought, so our gross margin was better than what we had expected.",1
We are continuing to come out with new innovative products. It is a competitive world and we are thinking thoughtfully about driving growth both in our top and bottom lines and continuing to gain market share in all three of our product areas.,1
"And then Peter, just quickly, are you still planning to open about half of the new stores internationally this year?",1
"I donât know if it will be quite half but our international store openings will be greater this year than they were last. As of the end of the quarter, we had 208 stores open in total and 27 of those were outside the U.S. And weâve increased our store opening forecast this year by a little bit to 45 stores for the year.",1
Weâll move to Richard Gardner with Citigroup.,1
"So there were a number for factors that played into the gross margin coming down but again, itâs better than what we expected it to be. We guided to 32 and achieved 32.9. Tim.",1
"Thanks, Peter, and Tim, and everybody, actually. I wanted to ask about the gross margin. I am still struggling to understand the gross margin that you reported in the quarter. I understand that you said that the decline in Leopard sales represented the biggest portion of that but it looked like from the segment data that you reported that Leopard revenue was down about $100 million sequentially perhaps. And so that would be about a point of impact on the gross margin sequentially. And given the price cut you did on Shuffle, it seems like that at most was another point impact on the gross margin. And yet since October weâve had DRAM and NAND pricing down 60% to 70% or more and panel pricing has been pretty favorable as well.",1
"So Iâm just wondering if there was anything about the timing of when you procured the components that went into the systems that you built in Q1 that had an impact on the gross margin. In other words, was a lot of the NAND and DRAM that went into Q1 products procured in the December quarter? And if thatâs the case, should we expect to get some benefit as you procure a lot of NAND and DRAM now at much lower prices on the Q2 gross margin? Thank you.",1
"Rich, let me -- Iâd like to make a couple of comments about some of the first things you said and then Tim can address some of your later points.",1
"Our Leopard revenues in the December quarter as we talked about in January was $170 million, and they were just over $40 million in the March quarter. So together, a little over $210 million in the first half. Leopard is by far the best-selling release in our history.",1
"But the sequential decline in Leopard and also iLife and iWork went into its third quarter, were a bit greater than what you thought, so the impact of sequential gross margin decline therefore was a little bigger.",1
"And you also have to factor in, in addition to the pricing actions that we took, lower sequential revenue, so we had less leverage on fixed costs, and iTunes was a bigger mix of the business this quarter than last, and it has a lower gross margin as well.",1
"Any further thoughts on cash use, what you are going to do with all that cash?",1
No change to announce to you today.,1
Weâll move to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.,1
So no comment on gross margins? Okay. Thanks.,1
On the Mac side the only unusual thing in the linearity side was we started shipping the Macbook Air late in January. It was constrained most of the quarter and so a lot of those shipments did go out in the month of March.,1
"By the end of March, we were at near a supply/demand balance on it.",1
"Okay, and then just one final question -- well, actually, linearity on iPhone and then --",1
"iPhone again, we really outstripped our supply toward the end of the quarter because we sold more than we had expected. We thought there would be a -- more of a sequential decline there than there was. It was reasonably strong throughout but March in particular was strong.",1
"Okay, great. And then just any indication you can give us with regard to Macbook Air on gross margins above or below -- I donât know, anything youâd give us as a metric?",1
The customers love it.,1
Not at the individual unit level.,1
"Good afternoon. Hopefully one last question on the iPhone and the March 6th date; so you obviously recognize -- do not recognize the revenue after March 6th but you would recognize the costs and the expenses related to that, is that correct?",1
Weâll move to our next question; Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.,1
"Peter, when you in fact ship the SDK, is there a catch-up period for the phones that were shipped or is it all ratably from that point?",1
"If I understand your question, Keith, we will begin to recognize the revenue and the product cost once we ship the 2.0 software over the remaining lives of the -- remaining lives for the phone.",1
"So there is no catch-up period, it will be ratably from that point?",1
"Ratably, yes, over the remaining life.",1
"Fair enough. Okay, and then Peter, I want to go to the gross margin side. When I look at the year-over-year comps, gross margins were down about 220 basis points. You flagged some areas that were different on the sequential basis. Leopard would be out of the equation; in fact, software was a richer mix when you look at March to March. Could you just pick out a couple of the other large drivers of change on a year-over-year basis? And particularly if you could identify whether the mix between CPUs and iPods was favorable or unfavorable.",1
"Okay, and then linearity during the quarter for both iPhones as well as Macs?",1
"Within each of those, the consumer appears to be very strong. Our pro business also had a very nice pick-up last quarter. The Mac Pro sold more units since it debuted with the new Intel processor. Education was up 35% in the U.S. And so overall, just strength everywhere. We felt very good.",1
"First of all, we are seeing strength in all geographies. It has been amazing at how balance it has been. If you look at the Mac, in the Americas we were up 52% year over year; in Europe, we were up 48%; in Japan, we were up 47%; and so it is very solid throughout. In Asia-Pacific we were actually up 62. And so these are obviously all multiples to the market growth.",1
And then also just any comment you can make about linearity during the quarter? Thanks.,1
"Okay, thought I would try. You know, weâve got to try sometimes. Anyway, final question though is on the channel, because obviously your Mac sales were quite strong. Can you talk a little bit about where you are seeing the strength in the channel? Obviously you are expanding a bit more on your stores but from a CES standpoint or consumer electronics versus direct?",1
"We donât comment on new products, sorry.",1
"Okay, and any thoughts on maintaining a 2.5G iPhone once the 3G is out?",1
"The carrier partners are free to price the iPhone as low as they wish and beyond that, I wouldnât comment on the specific commercial arrangements between us and the carriers because those are confidential.",1
"A couple of questions; the first, can you talk a little bit about what we are seeing with the pricing at some of your European carrier partners with regard to the iPhone? Who bears the cost on this? Is this something carrier driven? Any commentary you can make on that?",1
Weâll move to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"We are shipping product every day, Gene, but I am not going to forecast the exact in-stock levels of the stores. But weâve factored in our current thinking of supply/demand into the guidance.",1
"And just lastly as far as the inventory in the U.S. Apple stores throughout this quarter, should we assume that it will start to creep back up throughout the quarter, or should we just kind of assume itâs going to be sporadic availability throughout the quarter?",1
"Because the customers that purchased the phone on or after March 6th presumably were aware of the software that we told them that we were going to come out with and that they were going to get it for free, and as a result of our announcement the way you properly account for that is to defer the revenue and that is what we are going to do.",1
"Okay. So then why if everybody is going to get it for free, why are you deferring after March 6th?",1
"No, as I said in my prepared remarks, we will be providing that software to the then current iPhone customers for free.",1
Okay and then second is will you be charging for the upgrade for those who bought iPhones before March 6th for the version 2.0?,1
"No, Gene. We will delay recognition of both the revenue and the product costs on the iPhone beginning on March 6th until we release the software, but we will continue to expense our operating expenses around selling and advertising and engineering as period costs as we always have.",1
"So thatâs what went into our thinking but again, I couldnât be happier with the performance of the business. I think the guidance we are giving is very strong and would just end by saying again, itâs a growth rate that is faster than what we saw in the year-ago quarter.",1
"Third, we expect a sequential decrease in iPod sales, as we have seen in the last couple of years, so nothing new there.",1
"Because we announced the specific new features to be included in the iPhone 2.0 release and plan to provide them to iPhone customers as a free upgrade in late June, we will delay the start of revenue recognition for all iPhones sold on or after our March 6th announcement date until the iPhone 2.0 software is delivered.",1
"And the better-than-expected results were primarily due to the favorable commodity environment that Tim discussed, higher revenue in the quarter, and a weaker dollar. The sequential declines in Q1 was primarily due to Leopard entering its second quarter of sales, and as we mentioned on last quarterâs call and as we have seen in the past, a new OS has significantly more sales in its debut quarter. And the change in Leopard and the other Apple software sequentially accounted for over 80% of the gross margin decline that we saw, as we expected.",1
"Ben, maybe Iâll let Tim make a few comments about the commodity environment and then let me talk more broadly about gross margin in the March quarter and what we expect in June.",1
"Ben, commodity pricing in both DRAM and the NAND Flash markets hit historically low levels during the March quarter and we would expect that pricing in the current quarter to remain favorable, and we folded that into our guidance.",1
We believe that the LCD markets near a supply/demand balance and weâll have relatively stable pricing.,1
"Hard drives, optical drives and most other commodities are in a supply/demand balance and we would expect these commodities to follow historical pricing trends.",1
"And in terms of the quarter, did anything go against you though that was unexpected in the gross margin line, or was there an impact from the lower price of the shuffles that maybe some of us didnât anticipate?",1
"Let me continue on and Iâll address that and talk a little bit about the June quarter as well. As we commented in last quarterâs call, we expected gross margin to decline by about 2.7%. We actually exceeded our guidance this quarter by 90 basis points and the gross margin only reduced by 1.8%.",1
"Other factors affecting gross margin in the quarter were the Shuffle price change; we took several international price reductions as a result of a changing currency market; a higher mix of iTunes, which has lower gross margin; and a sequential decline in the revenues from the holiday quarter, again which were expected.",1
(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Ben Reitzes with Lehman Brothers.,1
"These factors were somewhat offset by favorable component pricing, allowing us to achieve a gross margin of 32.9%, again which was ahead of our guidance of 32.",1
"That was pretty detailed. Thatâs good. In terms of the iPhone, just really switching up and then Iâll cede the floor here, with regard to the iPhone weâve all noticed less availability, especially as we got towards the end of the quarter and recently. Is there anything -- and then we are widely expecting new products, but is there anything you can say that will give us confidence that you can grow that segment sequentially given the current amount of supply out there? Is there anything you are worried about and what not on the iPhone side in terms of shortages or anything? Or should we assume that you have a handle on that and can grow that business sequentially?",1
We are confident on hitting the 10 million for the year. I think that would be the main point.,1
"In terms of the shortages that you referenced, we expected iPhone to decline more on a sequential basis than it did, so we really beat our unit expectations and as a result, as we got toward the end of the quarter we started to experience some stock out.",1
"At this point, both inventory in our stores and our channel inventories are currently low. Our U.S. stores have experienced more stock outs, or relatively more, and we believe the reason is that there are more phones being bought there with the intention of unlocking, which remains a significant number.",1
"Okay, and you donât want to clarify that number this time?",1
"Good afternoon. Thanks a lot. Nice revenue and performance. I wanted to ask you a little bit about gross margin. You know, 32.9 was really good but I was wondering if you had thought actually more could flow to the bottom line and what maybe some of the negative cross-currents were. And then also, what gives you the confidence of 33% the next quarter? Just a little bit more on that would be helpful, thanks, and then I just have a follow-up on iPhone.",1
We remain very confident in our business and continue to be excited about the new products in our pipeline.,1
"Second, we will not begin recognition of new iPhone sales until we deliver the iPhone 2.0 software in late June, as Iâve discussed.",1
"The tax rate for the quarter was about 29%, below the expected 32% due to higher foreign earnings and lower interest income. We expect the tax rate for the second half of fiscal 2008 to be 31%.",1
The revenue and cost of sales associated with these iPhones will be recognized ratably over the remaining terms of their respective 24-month estimated lives. Revenue recognition of handsets sold prior to March 6th and payments from carries has not changed as a result of our announcements.,1
"I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores which had another terrific quarter with revenue growing 74% year over year to $1.45 billion. The stores sold 458,000 Macs during the quarter, an increase of 67% year over year. We opened four stores during the quarter to end with 208. With an average of 205 stores opened during the quarter, average revenue per store was $7.1 million, compared to $4.8 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 48%.",1
"Operating profit doubled year over year to $334 million from $164 million. A primary objective in our stores has been helping people to get more out of their Macs and the stores delivered 580,000 one-hour personal training sessions during the quarter.",1
"We opened our 15th store in the United Kingdom during the March quarter and we looked forward to opening our first stores in Australia, China, and Switzerland in the coming months. We expect to open about 45 stores during fiscal 2008 and continue to be very confident in the investments we are making in the stores and the asset we are building.",1
"Total company gross margin was 32.9%, which was a little stronger than our guidance due to a more favorable commodity environment, higher overall revenue, and a weaker dollar.",1
"Operating expenses were $1.16 billion, including $112 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $162 million, below our guidance due to the lower interest rate environment.",1
"We generated $1 billion in cash during the quarter, ending with $19.4 billion. Cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion. In the first half of fiscal 2008, we generated $4 billion in cash from $2.6 billion in net income, the difference being driven largely by the iPhone and strong working capital management.",1
"In closing, we are extremely proud of our growth and business performance in the March quarter. Our 51% Mac sales increase is the strongest quarterly growth rate weâve generated in almost two decades and 3.5 times the market rate of growth. We are very excited about the delivery of the iPhone 2.0 software in late June and the vast potential for compelling solutions that our SDK opens up for the developer community.",1
"Looking ahead to the June quarter, I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"For the quarter, we are targeting revenue of about $7.2 billion, or approximately 33% growth over the prior June quarter. We expect the total quarterly costs of non-cash stock-based compensation to be approximately $135 million.",1
"We expect gross margin to be about 33%, reflecting approximately $20 million related to stock-based compensation expense.",1
"We expect OpEx to be about $1.185 billion, including about $115 million related to stock-based compensation expense.",1
"We expect OI&E to decline to about $115 million due to the impact of recent interest rate cuts, and we expect the tax rate to be about 31%.",1
We expect to generate EPS of about $1.00.,1
"I canât clarify it. Itâs not that I donât want to; itâs that it is very difficult to come up with a very precise estimate of it, but we do believe the number continues to be significant and our view continues to be that this is a proxy for the worldwide demand of the phone, and our focus is very much on rolling out to more geos and we are on target to roll out into more countries in Europe and to enter Asia later in the year.",1
"Great, thanks so much, guys.",1
Weâll move to Bill Fearnley with FTN Midwest.,1
We will move to David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.,1
"The unit number includes phones of all types, locked and unlocked.",1
"And then final question, you havenât said anything in your call about economic headwinds. Itâs obviously something people are focusing on. It seems you are benefiting from resistance to some of those headwinds and also share gains. Any commentary you can offer in addition to the comments youâve made that help us understand some of the kind of sustained drivers of that?",1
"We are going to leave economic commentary to others and we are focused on managing our business, which performed exceptionally well in the March quarter, and I credit it to just outstanding innovative products that drove amazing results.",1
The U.S. business performed quite well in March. Our revenue grew 40% and this growth rate was twice last yearâs March quarter U.S. growth rate of 20 and faster than we grew in the December quarter of 27%.,1
"Mac sales in the U.S. were up 51% and traffic through our stores were up 12 million people year over year and we only have 208 stores. So look, we remain very confident in our business, in our strategy, and we will continue to invest in hardware and software products to delight our customers.",1
"We read the same things that you do but I have provided guidance for the June quarter, which has revenue growing at 33% and again, that is an acceleration from the rate we saw last June by about 10 points.",1
"Thank you very much. I was wondering, did you give a date on when you are expecting to deliver the 2.0 software for the iPhone? And could you help us understand what impact that has on gross margin, if any?",1
"I wanted to ask a couple of channel questions, if I could. Could you guys give some more color on the direct versus indirect mix? And then also, could you give us any update on where you are with the expansion of the Best Buy footprint?",1
"David, what we said is we intend to deliver the iPhone 2.0 software in late June and I have included the delay in revenue recognition in the 33% gross margin that I have given you for the quarter. And again, this affects iPhone handset sales only between March 6th and when we deliver the software and it does not impact phones sold prior to March 6th or payments from carriers.",1
But it is fair to say it does have negative impact on gross margin during that period?,1
"Well, we will not recognize revenue until we deliver the software, and so that has an impact.",1
"And then just on your target for the June quarter, you have revenue down I think 4% quarter over quarter, and typically it is up. Is there any particular area that you expect to be sub-seasonal in the next quarter?",1
"Well, let me talk a little bit about it. We are guiding to $7.2 billion, which again is a 33% increase from the year-ago quarter and is an acceleration of about 10 points from what we saw last June where we grew 24%.",1
"We factored several things into our thinking. First, our Mac channel inventory this past quarter did increase by about 60,000 in the March quarter, as a result of the Macbook Air launch and accelerated sales velocity.",1
And does that forecast include some now going forward assumption on your part of an unlocked phone percentage?,1
We donât comment on new products but I would just reiterate that we are confident with hitting the 10 million and obviously a part of that is rolling out to more geographies and weâve been working very hard at this and feel confident that we will be able to roll out in more places than Europe and to enter Asia during the year.,1
"Okay and just on the iPhone with regard to your 10 million guidance, can you talk a little bit about how important either 3G might be to that or how important at least the timing of some of your pending products that you are referring to in your press release and on your excitement around the iPhone kind of weighs into that 10 million, based on current momentum?",1
Until the software is delivered.,1
"Okay, so really what we are looking at is just the exclusion of hardware revenue next quarter, really from iPhone?",1
"Once we deliver the software, we will resume recognition, revenue recognition of the phones on what we sold between March 6th and that date and begin to recognize, as we had in the past, iPhone revenue on a go-forward basis. And as I said in my prepared remarks, this does not impact phones sold prior to March 6th or payments from carriers.",1
We are doing this -- as I said in my prepared remarks -- because we announced specific new features that will be included in the iPhone 2.0 software that we plan to provide for customers for free who purchased after our announcement on March 6th. So we will delay revenue recognition on phones sold between March 6th and the date of the delivery of the software.,1
"Thanks very much. Can you just qualify a little bit more the reasons for the delay of the start of revenue recognition on the iPhone and what your thinking was there based on the 2.0 release? And also, what kind of impact we should -- how we should think about relaying that into our iPhone numbers?",1
Weâll move on to Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital.,1
"Appreciate it, thank you.",1
"I am always worried about budgets and will continue to worry about budgets but the results that we have seen to date, with a 35% increase year over year, we have not seen any issue today.",1
And there has been a lot of chatter about state and local government spending. Are you guys happy with the institutional part of the education business?,1
"And we recently learned that we surpassed Dell last year in the portables market share for higher education, so we have significant momentum in this area.",1
"The numbers that Peter quoted in the preamble, we were up 35% and both institutional and individual buying was relatively strong. The quarter that we are now in is a big K-12 quarter and of course back to school is more of a higher education quarter. I wouldnât want to predict exact numbers but as Peter had mentioned, the 35% is the highest growth rate weâve seen in ED in eight years.",1
"And then a follow-up on education, if I could; with education, can you delineate between student buy programs and institutional buying and education, what you experienced this quarter and what you experienced for the upcoming quarter?",1
"And in terms of Best Buy, we ended with a little over 400 stores, which was to our plan, and we continue to target to be at 600 in the summer. The rollout is going extremely well and we are very, very happy with it.",1
"Bill, the direct sales in the quarter were 53% and that was up from 49 in the year-ago quarter.",1
"Rob, I'm not able to comment specifically and beyond what I said, which is that we will recognize payments from AT&T Cingular as revenue over time as earned. Tim, did you want to comment?",1
"If I could just follow-up, maybe a clarification: you talked about payments, Cingular AT&T. Are you guys getting subsidies for the phone or a percentage of the monthly service contracts that customers enter in to? How is that relationship going to work?",1
"Rob, I'll make a few comments and then Tim can add on. I'm guiding gross margin down sequentially, largely as a result of the commodity pricing beginning to trend up but also, the beginning of our education buying season which we will see higher K to 12 purchases this quarter, typically at lower price points. A couple weeks ago, we completely repriced our display line and that had an impact as well.",1
"Thank you, Sir. Weâll take our next question from Richard Gardiner of Citigroup.",1
"Okay, one more, just a housekeeping item here. When thereâs some controversy when the actual back-to-school buying season starts. Is it in May through end of September? Could you just give us some color on that?",1
"We generally begin to see some uplift in late June, but itâs principally in July through September.",1
"Okay, so I know you guys arenât going to announce timing of products but, for example, the iBook, when would that have to be out? And again, this is not about the exact timing, but when would that have to be out to basically really hit the sweet spot of the back-to-school?",1
Weâre not going to comment on unannounced products.,1
"Okay, but any comments in terms of what the best window for getting the iBook out would be?",1
"Again, Iâm not going to comment on an unannounced product.",1
"Okay, thank you. Tim, one for you. I was hoping maybe you could comment on the supply/demand balance for the new Intel-based products that you've launched so far this year, exiting the quarter.",1
"Okay, but is it safe to say that your general thinking about pricing be consistent in the future or do you think it potentially could change? Any thoughts on that front?",1
"And then I guess for Peter, I know we've been talking about seasonality in your guidance for the June quarter throughout the call, but can you just give us a sense of what you consider to be normal seasonality for both the Mac and the music businesses going into June, excluding some of the product transition and other, I guess unusual, things that you might have going on? Thanks.",1
"Rich, how about if I start and then Tim can answer your first question.",1
"For the iPod, past seasonal trends are really not applicable this year as prior yearsâ supply constraints, particularly with the iPod Mini, so weâre not sure that we have good historical data points to reference.",1
"For the Mac, past seasonal trends other than the beginning of the education buying season are also likely to not be as appropriate, given our transition to Intel.",1
"Rich, on the three different products that we announced during the quarter that have Intel processors, the iMac was in reasonable supply the entire quarter. The MacBook Pro, the shipments of the MacBook Pro accelerated in March. February shipments were relatively low. In March, the last two weeks of the quarter were particularly strong, and with those strong shipments, which included a significant amount of units that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we reduced our backlog to normal levels.",1
"You know, I would stress again the number of weeks that it was shipping, obviously, were limited for the quarter.",1
Iâm not going to project our future pricing.,1
"Gene, I donât want to comment on our future pricing plan, but I would make a point that we view the Mac mini as an incredible value. With Mac mini, we began to ship front row for the first time on the Mac mini. It also is the lowest-priced way to get into the iLife suite. So overall, we think itâs a great value for customers.",1
"Okay, and lastly, before I go back into the queue, is retail, you seem to be below expectations. Was there some kind of dynamic there where people were buying online and because of all the pre-orders of Macâs, or some kind of dynamic there that held retail sales down?",1
"Okay, and I guess on that note, what percentage of your iPod sales are domestic versus international?",1
"And you know, Iâll just add a little color to that. The retail stores have really been focused on the transition to Intel, and immediately upon our announcement at MacWorld, we changed all the product merchandise and the window displays and graphics in the store, really to communicate that this was the future.",1
"As Intel-based Macâs arrived in the stores, we stopped carrying the comparable PowerPC models, and as you may have seen, our retail sales teams were not discouraged from telling customers to wait for Intel-based Macâs if that was the best thing for the customer.",1
Yes. Next weâll go to Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray,1
"Yeah, good afternoon, everybody. Just I guess in terms of the iPod market share, could you give us just some color, what was domestic versus what was international?",1
"Sure. We have some data, we have some JFK and some BCN, and NPD. As I indicated, the March NPD data just came out this morning, and we were thrilled. Our market share increased to 78% from 71% in the December quarter.",1
"We donât have March data yet, internationally, but we do have some February data. Our market share increased in each of these markets from December to February. In the U.K., we were at 40%; Japan was 54%, Canada was 45%, and Australia was 58%.",1
"Gene, thatâs something that we just donât discuss because we donât want to help our competitors.",1
"On another topic here, in terms of the Mac business, I was a little bit surprised to see that the pricing of the Mac mini increased, and granted, youâve built in a lot more functionality, but I wouldâve thought that maybe you guys wouldâve taken advantage of some of those price advantage with the Intel platform and try to pass along to pick up market share, but it seems like youâre going in a little bit different direction. Is it safe to say youâre going to kind of continue in the same direction youâre going in terms of the pricing, or is every day a new day in terms of potentially where you could go with your pricing?",1
"Okay, well, I guess itâs safe to say that if you look at some of those other geographies, you have definitely a much lower market share, as youâve said, and you mentioned in your prepared comments about global expansion with the iPod, which sounds nice, but maybe you could talk a little bit about how youâre actually going to do that.",1
Okay. Iâll make some comments and Tim may want to add on.,1
"If you look outside some of the international countries that I referenced, such as Italy and Spain and Eastern Europe, and even China and Korea, our market share is much less than what I referenced in those five countries. And we are focused on increasing share by increasing our local advertising and point of distribution.",1
"Weâve seen some success there. For example, since December in Germany, our share has improved by 10 points, up to 21%.; and in France, we gained four points up to 11%.",1
"Okay, so itâs more directly related to advertising versus the pricing of the iPod?",1
"I think itâs many things -- our great product lineup, our distribution, the advertising weâre doing, the Music Store.",1
"On the Mac mini, we announced that at the end of February and were able to ship that for four weeks of the quarter.",1
"Okay, and if I could just follow up with one more question. Peter, could you just give us a sense of what the geographic mix is going to be of the 40 new retail stores that youâre opening this year?",1
Primarily in the U.S.,1
"We were thrilled with our other music sales in the quarter, which were up 125% year over year. As you know, it primarily consists of the iTunes music store sales and our iPod and music accessories.",1
"Separate topic regarding Flash pricing. Flash pricingâs coming off fairly sharply here, clearly helps your gross margins in the quarter. What are your thoughts about passing some of those price declines on to customers and accelerating unit growth? Any color on that would be helpful.",1
"We were able to benefit from Flash pricing in the quarter. We did take, if you recall, the Shuffle price down, the entry point, to $69. We also cut the price of the 1GB Shuffle to $99, and we announced a new entry point for the Nano at $149. We think all of those are an incredible value.",1
"Hi, just a couple of quick questions. First, Peter, on iTunes in particular, I believe you've seen seasonality in the second quarter as school let's out in the past. Could you just refresh my own memory in terms of what specifically you've seen in the past?",1
"Iâm sorry, for iTunes?",1
"Yes, and just music downloads.",1
"Well, let me really make some comments. I think more between December and March, and see what happens in June and report to you.",1
"Music sales were actually higher in the March quarter than they were in the December quarter, really showing the momentum that we have in the music store around the world.",1
Any sense of how many international are included in that?,1
"In terms of what we might expect for June, again we don't give specific product guidance, but we think we are continuing to gain momentum, and sales will vary also quarter by quarter, in part due to new releases.",1
"Just shifting gears, can you just talk about how and what type of CPU trends you saw as the new Intel CPUâs became more available, and whether or not you saw people come back into the stores as the supply improved?",1
"Rebecca, itâs Tim. Shipments of the Intel-based Macâs accelerated across the quarter, and the majority of the shipments that we did in the month of March were Intel-based. I think, just to pause there, itâs an incredible accomplishment I think to announce a transition in January and have that occur just 60 days thereafter.",1
"The customer response that we've gotten is enormous. The analyst response is enormous. And as we thought, if you look at the adoption rate of percentage of Intel-based units sold to total units, the consumer segment was the highest adoption, and you know, the store's clearly saw that in the month of March.",1
"And then on boot camp in particular, any color that you can provide in terms of impact that you saw post that announcement?",1
"The response has been written about a lot. We did this because we were getting a lot of customer requests for this, as many Windows users were considering switching to the Mac. We think that it makes the Mac even more appealing to them, but it is beta, and so we put that out there to get feedback. We've really just begun that. It's only been out two weeks.",1
We donât split it out.,1
And the split betweenâ¦,1
"We ended the quarter, as Peter spoke about in the preamble, within the targeted range of four to five weeks. If you recall, we began the quarter with less than four weeks in preparation for the MacWorld announcement. We were able to return to that targeted range by the end of the quarter by increasing the amount of inventory by about five days --- and keep in mind that inventory is in support of indirect sales only.",1
"Chris, I wonât break out the desktop versus portable channel inventory, but I will make some comments about channel inventory on the Mac overall.",1
"And in addition, in terms of the inventory levels and the channel, is there any significant difference between desktop inventory in the channel and notebook inventories in the channel?",1
I was hoping to get some color on the split between iBook and MacBook Proâs during the quarter in terms of units sold.,1
Yes. (Operator Instructions). Our next question will come from Chris Whitmore of Deutche Bank.,1
Nothing specifically. We were pleased with sales of all of our iPods.,1
"And any comments on mix, Nano versus Video iPod, or anything that you care to comment on for additional color in the iPod space?",1
"Yeah, they were about 20% in the March quarter.",1
"Okay, thanks. And also, I wanted to ask about iPod gross margins. You commented that they were above 20% last call. Could you update on what iPod gross margins were here for the second quarter?",1
"Again, Iâm not going to comment on pricing or unannounced products.",1
"Do you think youâd have to take any pricing actions on it though, to make it more attractive to institutions for later delivery?",1
"Bill, again, Iâm not going to comment on our product plans, but I would tell you that weâre very proud of the iBook G4, and many customers are continuing to buy it, and itâs a great product.",1
"Yes, thanks, guys. I'd like to take another crack at the iBook question. With the current product with the G4 processor, do you see having that as your offering going to the K-12 education institutions, you know, the selling season or the pre-selling season for delivery in July through September? Do you think that's going to hurt you in the education business? Or do you think you'll be able to sell some of the G4 processors into the education institutions? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"Yes, weâll take our next question from Bill Fearnley of FTN Midwest Securities.",1
I think a little more than 30 will be in the United States.,1
"Well, our retail stores were really focusing on the transition to Intel, and given our Intel announcement that we made at MacWorld with later delivery, particularly with the MacBook Pro, you know, this limited the number of shipping weeks in the quarter. And this, combined with the overall pause that we observed impacted the quarter.",1
"And weâve also factored the lower ASPâs into the guidance, both for the Mac and iPod, as we enter the education buying season, and incur the fourth quarter impact of the shuffle price decrease and the introduction of the 1GB Nano.",1
"Peter and Tim, can you walk us through the puts and takes behind the sequential decline in gross margin? The component environment outlook would probably be the most important factor to hear about.",1
"The new-to-Mac percentage increased to 50% of Macs sold in the store's most recent survey. We opened six new stores during the quarter, exiting with 141. With an average of 138 stores opened during the quarter, average quarterly revenue per store was $4.6 million. Retail segment profit was $29 million, compared to $42 million in the year ago quarter, and the associated manufacturing margin not reflected in the retail segment profit was $128 million compared to the $102 million in the year ago quarter.",1
"The music store's U.S. content has continued to expand impressively, and now includes over 2.9 million songs, 60,000 pod casts, 9,000 music videos, and over 70 television programs from ABC, NBC, CBS, HBO, ESPN and Showtime.",1
"We remain extremely enthusiastic about Apple's music business. Despite a large field of competitors, the most recently published data from NPD Tech World shows that Apple's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players has increased in March to 78% from 71% in December.",1
"The iPod Ecosystem continues to thrive, with over 2,000 iPod accessories currently available. There is increasing interest from the automotive industry, and we estimate that 40% of new cars sold in the U.S. this year will offer direct iPod integration.",1
"Looking outside the U.S., the iPod is also the top selling MP3 player by a wide margin in the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and Canada based on the latest data from GFK and BCN. In the rest of Europe and Asia, we do not enjoy the same level of market share and we view this as an opportunity.",1
"We are optimistic about further market penetration potential globally and our ability to grow international market share. Considering penetration rates of other consumer electronic products, the MP3 player market has a lot of room for growth. According to Forrester Research, U.S. household MP3 player penetration was less than one-quarter that of digital still cameras as of the end of 2005.",1
"Turning to Apple's retail segment, revenue from the Apple retail stores totaled $636 million for the quarter, reflecting the transition to Intel and broader indirect iPod distribution.",1
"Traffic through our retail stores continued to be strong during the quarter, growing from 13 million visitors to 18.1 million visitors year over year, and translating to over 10,000 visitors per store per week.",1
"Other music product revenue was $485 million, up 125% year over year, and about flat sequentially with 14-week holiday quarter. These results were a function of continued strong sales from the iTunes music store, the introduction of the iPod hi-fi, and very solid demand for other iPod accessory products.",1
"Customer interest in the new Creative Studios was high during the quarter, and we staffed up to deliver over 50,000 one-to-one personal training sessions. We will continue to add new stores at a measured pace and expect to open a total of 40 new stores during fiscal '06.",1
"In terms of geographic results, including sales from our retail stores, quarterly revenue in the Americas, Europe, and Japan was up 38%, 37%, and 8% respectively. Gross margin was 29.8% on a GAAP basis, about 200 basis points higher than our guidance, primarily due to a favorable component pricing environment, higher-than-expected software sales, and lower-than-expected costs associated with the Intel transition.",1
"Included in GAAP costs of goods sold was $5 million in stock-based compensation expense. Excluding that expense, non-GAAP gross margin was 29.9%.",1
"GAAP operating expenses were $768 million, including $37 million in expense related to stock-based compensation.",1
"Non-GAAP OpEx was $731 million, in line with our guidance.",1
OI&E was $76 million and the tax rate was 32%.,1
"The iTunes music store sold its one-billionth song during the March quarter. According to the most recent data from Nielsen Soundscan, the iTunes Music Store counts for 87% share of the market for legally purchased and downloaded music in the United States.",1
"iPod shipments grew 61% year over year, and weâve cumulatively shipped over 50 million. We exited the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks for iPod channel inventory.",1
"Okay, well, as you know, we donât give product level guidance, but as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we are factoring into the guidance a continued pause in demand from the transition to Intel, and included in that is our thinking that some customers may wait for unannounced products and certain applications becoming universal.",1
"In January, we indicated that we have seen a pause in customer demand in the December quarter as customers began to anticipate the introduction of the Intel Mac, and we said that we were factoring the transition into our guidance for the March quarter.",1
"The quarter's revenue of $4.36 billion was the second highest in Apple's history, topped only by our record December quarter results, and grew 34% year over year. These results were driven by continued strong growth in our music business and solid performance in our Mac business during the transition to Intel.",1
"Operating margin for the quarter was 12.1%, and net income was $410 million, or $0.47 per diluted share on a GAAP basis.",1
"Excluding the impact of $42 million in non-cash, stock based compensation expense, operating margin was 13.1%, net income was $440 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.50.",1
The quarter's non-GAAP operating margin was the second-best ever for Apple and demonstrates the leverage in our business model.,1
"I'd like to first talk about our Mac business, which represented 50% of our total quarterly revenue, an increase 7% year over year. Mac units were up 4% year over year to 1.11 million, and ending channel inventory was within our target range of 4 to five weeks.",1
"We continue to be very happy with our progress in the Intel transition. We have introduced the MacBook Pro, new iMac, and new Mac-Mini with Intel processors, and we are solidly on track to have the entire Mac product line transitioned by the end of this calendar year.",1
"As we anticipated, this pause was even more evident during the March quarter, and was generally observed in three areas.",1
"Our Music business posted another quarter of very strong results, representing 50% of total company revenue and increasing 79% year over year.",1
"First, we announced the MacBook Pro at MacWorld and began to ship in late February, which limited the number of shipping weeks in the quarter.",1
"Second, we observed purchasing delays as some customers are waiting for the remainder of our product announcements.",1
"Third, while developer progress on universal applications has been excellent, we believe some customers are delaying purchasing until certain universal applications are available.",1
"Customer and industry analyst feedback on the new Intel-based products has been very positive, and we're very enthusiastic about the additional Intel-based Macs that we will be introducing this year.",1
"We have released universal versions of Apple software, including iLife, iWork, QuickTime, Final Cut Studio, Aperture, and Logic.",1
"Our third-party developers are making excellent progress with our transitions as well, with over 1,500 universal applications currently available, and commitments from key developers such as Adobe and Microsoft.",1
We used some of the cash to make several investments during the quarter.,1
"First, we made the remaining $500 million prepayments relating to the agreements for future supply of NAND Flash memory components that we announced in the December quarter.",1
"Second, we net share settled executive income tax obligations from vesting of restricted shares and share units by purchasing and canceling about 5.5 million shares for $353 million.",1
Yes. Next weâll go to Ben Reitzes of UBS.,1
"And then, second, was mix between systems and iPods a factor at all in the gross margin performance? Thank you.",1
"Richard, yeah, on the component point of view, we were able to secure lower costs than we had planned for the quarter, particularly on LCDâs and Flash memory, and this helped drive the gross margins that Peter talked about in the preamble.",1
"Richard, in terms of the second part of your question, there were really three factors, as I indicated, that helped us do better on the gross margin. The commodity environment, as Tim alluded to. Also, our software sales were better than we expected, particularly with the new iLife and iWork applications that we introduced at MacWorld.",1
"And in our guidance, we contemplated price reductions on some of our transitioning PowerPC products, which we largely didnât need to incur.",1
So mix between iPod and systems was not a variance?,1
"Not a primary one, no.",1
"Yeah, good afternoon, thanks. Could you just characterize whatâs going on with iPod demand? Obviously 8.5 is a big drop-off from the 14.1, and obviously thereâs seasonality, there were some things with the extra week. Maybe you could go back in time as well and talk about what the extra week might have, in hindsight, now given you in iPods, and then how iPods are going out of the quarter.",1
"Third, we spent about $120 million to acquire a new data center in the first of several properties to form a second Cupertino campus.",1
"And then, to make this question longer, it seems that based on the ASP there was a drop-off in Nanos, a little more than expected, so could you just characterize the state of iPod demand?",1
"Overall, Ben, weâre very pleased with the quarter. We shipped 8.5 million iPods and it was up over 60% year over year.",1
"The December quarter included a 14th week, and that week fell between Christmas and New Yearâs, and was one of the better shopping weeks of the year. And so that week sell-through was certainly better than the average of the quarter.",1
"And as we discussed in January, we also increased the channel inventory by about 550,000 iPods. So when you take these factors into account, the sequential iPod sales were down much less than 40% which, according to NPD Techworld, has been the typical sequential CE unit decline that you've seen from December to March.",1
"So I think the state of the iPods, we're very, very happy with it, with the results that we had this quarter, and are excited about what we have in the product pipeline.",1
"What is in your guidance for iPods, and maybe more on guidance? You're basically flattish in revenue, but yet you should do better in Macâs because you may have more units. If you could just characterize some of the puts and takes between iPods and Macâs that went into that guidance.",1
"Okay. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the gross margin variances. You alluded to component pricing. Can you comment on the impact of the purchases of components, either benefiting you or hurting you on that point?",1
"Hi, can you hear me?",1
"Yes. If youâd like to ask a question at this time, it is star 1 on your touch-tone telephone. Weâll take our first question from Richard Chu of Cohen. Please go ahead.",1
"Could we have the first question, please?",1
"Through the first half of fiscal 2006, Apple has generated over $10 billion in revenue and almost $1 billion in net income. We are very proud to have delivered strong revenue in earnings growth during the transition to Intel. We are extremely happy with how well the transition has been going, and we are very enthusiastic about all aspects of our music business. We are confident that our strategy of investing in product innovation is working, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline.",1
We expect non-GAAP EPS to be about $0.43 to $0.47.,1
"We expect to generate GAAP EPS of about $0.39 to $0.43, which includes an anticipated $0.04 per share related to non-cash share-based compensation expense.",1
"We expect OI&E to be about $85 million, and we expect the tax rate to be 32%.",1
"We expect non-GAAP OpEx to be about $730 million, similar to the March quarter.",1
"We expect GAAP OpEx to be $775 million, including about $45 million related to stock-based compensation.",1
"Without that expense, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 28.5%.",1
"We expect GAAP gross margin to be about 28.4%, reflecting approximately $5 million related to stock-based compensation expense.",1
We expect total quarterly costs of non-cash stock-based compensation to be approximately $50 million.,1
"For the quarter, we are targeting revenue between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion. We are factoring into our guidance a continued pause in demand in the Mac business related to the transition to Intel. We are also factoring in lower ASPs for Macs and iPods, due to the beginning of the education buying season, and for the full quarter impact of the iPod Shuffle price reductions and the introduction of the one gigabyte Nano.",1
"Looking ahead to the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.",1
"Despite these significant investments, cash declined by just $481 million during the quarter to $8.23 billion due to strong earnings, excellent working capital management and stock option exercises.",1
"Fourth, we made other capital expenditures of $73 million, including $42 million for our retail initiative.",1
"But you would say that just in terms of what you saw from consumers and what you saw flowing to the store, what have you, that it was consistent with what we've seen written about from third parties?",1
Weâre seeing a high level of interest in it.,1
Right. Thank you both very much.,1
"Sure. The segment profit was $29 million, and the manufacturing margin that was not included in the segment profit was $128 million.",1
So the idea would really be to consolidate the teams that we have into two campuses. We have about 30 buildings scattered across Cupertino that the people are in.,1
Okay. How many employees work at the one Infinite Loop campus right now?,1
"We have many thousand employees here in Cupertino, but we aren't disclosing how many are on the campus.",1
"Okay, and then moving on. Profitability of iTunes, are you still running for break even? What are your thought processes, as you obviously have expanded the content significantly?",1
"As I commented before, the store operated above break even in the quarter, and we think selling songs and video is really helping us to sell iPods.",1
"Okay, and then one final question. Can you just clarify the retail profit, just the profit from your retail stores this quarter?",1
"Thanks, Shannon. We have time for one more question.",1
"In the quarter, we spent about $120 million to acquire a new data center to support our future growth, and the first of several properties for a second campus in Cupertino.",1
"Our last question will come from David Bailey. Please go ahead, sir.",1
"Yes, thank you. Just a quick clarification, did you say that you increased iPod channel inventory by 550,000 units in the December quarter and can you tell us how many units, if any, that you added in the March quarter?",1
"David, we did increase channel inventory in the December quarter by 550. As we entered the quarter, we were within the targeted range of four to six weeks on a look-forward basis, and as we exited the quarter, we were within that range. And also, the number of weeks is approximately the same in both cases.",1
"Good day, everyone and welcome to this Apple Inc. second quarter 2007 quarterly results conference call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer. He'll be joined by Apple COO Tim Cook and Treasurer Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today may consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, earnings per share, future products and non-cash, stock-based compensation expense. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2006, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2007, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak of their respective dates.",1
"As a result of the growth that we've had, we have increased the number of leased buildings in the greater Cupertino area, and this has become really much less efficient and very inconvenient for us. So we've gone out and are in the process of acquiring about 50 acres that are just about 10 minutes away from our current campus. We expect to break ground in a few years, and hopefully complete a second campus in around four years. We very much look forward to getting our teams closer together.",1
Let me go back through that.,1
"Thanks, Rebecca. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"Sure. You know, as I commented earlier, our retail stores are really focusing on the Intel transition. We made announcements at MacWorld and shipped and delivered product later, particularly with the MacBook Pro, and this impacted our stores.",1
"And then related to that, how many Mac locations do you currently have?",1
"We currently have around 7,000 around the world.",1
"And then just in terms of trends between direct and indirect, can you give some sense of how iPods and PCs have trended over the last several quarters?",1
"We don't break iPod and Mac direct/indirect out, but our direct sales in the March quarter were 44%, and in that we include direct sales to education and enterprise customers on-line, retail and our Music Store.",1
"Okay, and then the last question also relates to PC distribution. I understand what you guys were saying upfront in terms of the Intel stall, but if I look at the retail units, PC retail units sold -- even on a year over year basis, given that you guys have maybe three or four dozen more stores open -- it would actually suggest that the PC units per store are down fairly meaningfully on a year over year basis.",1
"I guess it seems counterintuitive that the stores would be the place that people would be most likely to convert, given the support that they have and the selection of inventory, so a little bit more thoughts on that would be helpful.",1
"And again, the stores were really focused from a Mac perspective on the transition to Intel. We very quickly changed the merchandising in the window displays and the graphics to focus on the Intel transition right after MacWorld in advance of product coming to the stores. As our first Intel-based Macs arrived in the stores, we generally stopped carrying the PowerPC based models.",1
"Hi, good afternoon. Just a question on your new facility. Any idea what you're going to spend on CapEx for that? I think you said $120 million was for the data center, which I think Steve mentioned you'd put together like, nine parcels or something? And then also the 3,000 to 3,500 employees, are those going to be incremental to sort of your current head count do you think, or is that just consolidating Cupertino?",1
"And as you may have seen, as I indicated, our sales teams really didn't discourage people from waiting for Intel-based models to arrive and really let the customer purchase what they wanted to, and that impacted us in the quarter.",1
"We remain very, very confident in our retail stores, they are delivering strong growth to the company, and our new-to-Mac percent in the quarter actually rose to about 50%.",1
"One last question. I meant to come back to the margin side real quickly. You guys had started several quarters ago the royalty licensing program, and obviously that's a contribution to margins as well. You didn't mention that, and so I'm wondering as it relates to iPod margins overall, was that a contributing factor?",1
"Iâm sorry, Harry, I can't comment on that because those agreements are confidential.",1
"Thanks. Can we have the next question, please.",1
We'll take the next question from Shannon Cross of Cross Research.,1
Apple News and Rumors,1
Apple Dashboard provides the latest news and analysis of Apple and its stock in a single page.,1
"It sucks in headlines from news sources, blogs and Apple's own press releases.",1
"Any shipment figures at this point, you said you were going to go with them going forward?",1
"In closing, we are very pleased with our results. In the first half of fiscal 2007, we generated $12.4 billion in revenue and $1.8 billion in earnings. Our Mac shipments were up 32% over the first half of 2006 and iPod shipments grew 40%. We're also very proud to have recently shipped our hundred millionth iPod. We're extremely excited about the launch of the iPhone in late June, and we continue to be very confident about the other innovative products in our pipeline.",1
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Andrew Neff â Bear Stearns.,1
"I wanted to follow-up on a statement you put out separately I guess from the board, talking about the situation related to the options. Can you give color as to rationale for that? Just give us your commentary on what appears to be discrepancies between two statements?",1
"Another question, can you give us the Apple TV numbers at this point?",1
"I will answer your first question and Tim can take your second. The board, put out its statement today, to express confidence in what we have said and done. The board said that Steve cooperated fully with Apple's independent investigation and with the government's investigation of stock option grants at Apple. The SEC investigated the matter thoroughly and its complaint speaks for itself in terms of what it says. What it does not say -- who it charges and who it does not charge â and the board has expressed its complete confidence in the conclusion of Apple's independent investigation and in Steve's integrity and his ability to lead the company.",1
"In regard to Apple TV, we've gotten some incredible reviews from many different sources. As you know, we just started shipping on the third week in March. We're off to a very good start and we're going to continue investing in this area. We're very, very excited about the long-term potential of the product.",1
We're not releasing the exact unit shipments.,1
Get Smart.,1
Your next question comes from Shannon Cross â Cross Research.,1
"Peter, if you could explain again the subscription model for the Apple TV and what the rationale is behind that?",1
We have a proven capability to create innovative software that gives us a tremendous competitive advantage in the consumer electronic industry. We are taking this step so that we can leverage what we do best. We believe that the results of this will be that we can surprise and delight our iPhone customers. We think they will be happier as a result and believe we'll have more of them as we enter this billion unit per year market.,1
"Just a question with regard to staffing, since there was a bit of a delay on Leopard. How do you feel right now about your current staffing levels? Ability to hire employees, was this sort of a one-time thing or are you looking to staff up at this point?",1
"We have no issue at all in hiring really great people. This is simply a matter of iPod is a very revolutionary product, it uses Mac OS as you know. So we have always planned on using Mac OS resources to complete the iPhone. It's taking us a little more time or resources than we thought, so we made a choice and delayed Leopard. We think it's the right choice.",1
Your next question comes from Rob Semple â Credit Suisse.,1
"We expect OpEx to be about $915 million, including about $56 million related to stock-based compensation. This includes increased marketing expenses related to the launch of the iPhone. We expect OI&E to be about $150 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 32%. We expect to generate EPS of about $0.66 including an anticipated $0.05 per share related to non-cash stock-based compensation expense.",1
"Looking ahead to the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. For the quarter, we are targeting revenue of about $5.1 billion. We expect the total quarterly cost of non-cash stock-based compensation to be approximately $65 million. We expect gross margin to be about 32%, reflecting approximately $9 million related to stock-based compensation expense.",1
"Similar to iPhone, we plan to periodically provide new software features and enhancements at no charge to our Apple TV customers. We will also recognize the revenue and product cost of goods sold associated with Apple TV on a straight line basis over 24 months. This will be included in the other music-related products and services in the data summary we provide you each quarter. Additionally, we will provide you with a schedule each quarter in our earnings release that indicates the total deferred revenue, including the combined amounts related to the iPhone and Apple TV.",1
"Apple's proven capability to create innovative software gives us a tremendous competitive advantage in the consumer electronics industry. We are taking this bold step to leverage what we do best. We hope the result will be to surprise and delight our iPhone customers, which should result in happier customers and more customers as we enter this billion unit per year mobile phone market. We also plan to recognize payments from AT&T Cingular as revenue over time, as earned. We will report iPhone results each quarter that will include unit sales, and recognize revenue for iPhones, iPhone accessories and payments from AT&T Cingular.",1
"We plan to build on this incredible foundation by continuing to develop new software features as well as entirely new applications and incorporate them into the iPhone. Since iPhone customers will likely be our best advocates for the product, we want to get them many of these new features and applications at no additional charge as they become available. Since we will be periodically providing new software features to iPhone customers free of charge, we will use subscription accounting and recognize the revenue and product cost of goods sold associated with iPhone handset sales on a straight line basis over 24 months. So while the cash from iPhone sales will be collected at the time of sale, we will be recording deferred revenue and costs of goods sold on our balance sheet, and amortizing both of them into our earnings on a straight line basis over 24 months. We will continue to expense our iPhone engineering, sales and marketing costs as we incur them. This accounting policy will have no impact on cash flow or the economics of our business.",1
"Before I talk about the outlook for the June quarter, I'd like to provide a little more information about our strategy for the iPhone and Apple TV and how we plan to account for them. We believe the iPhone is a revolutionary device that is years ahead of the competition. At Macworld, we demonstrated a number of the iPhone's breakthrough features, including its pioneering multi-touch display and user interface, visual voicemail, desktop class e-mail and web browsing, and of course, the best iPod ever.",1
"Operating expenses were $863 million including $54 million in expense related to stock-based compensation. We capitalized $27 million of software development expense during the quarter. OI&E was $148 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 32%. We had strong cash generation during the quarter, increasing our cash balance by over $700 million to end with $12.6 billion.",1
"Gross margin was 35.1%, considerably higher than our guidance, primarily due to the very favorable commodity pricing environment, better product mix, lower service costs and leverage on higher revenues.",1
"The stores sold 275,000 Macs during the quarter, representing 79% year-over-year growth. As we've been reporting for some time now, over 50% of the customers buying Macs in our stores were new to the Mac. Over 21.5 million people visited our stores during the quarter, representing almost 10,000 customers per store per week. We've continued to invest in our stores to enhance the customer experience. They are a great place to view the Apple TV experience today and they are preparing for their biggest launch of all time, the iPhone in late June.",1
"We now have 21 stores outside the U.S., including our new store in Rome that opened last month. As we previously announced, we plan to open high profile stores in Sydney, Australia and Glasgow, Scotland later this calendar year. We're also pleased to announce plans for our third store in Manhattan at 14th Street and 9th Avenue, in the meat packing district.",1
"Sales from our Apple retail stores were $855 million, representing 34% year-over-year growth. The stores generated $32 million in segment margin, in addition to $174 million of associated manufacturing profit. We opened seven new stores during the quarter, ending with 177 stores. With an average of 172 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $5 million.",1
"Other music revenue grew 35% year over year, fueled by very strong sales through the iTunes store. This store's growing catalog now includes over 5 million songs, 350 television shows, and 500 movies. We're very pleased to have added titles from Paramount Pictures, Lions Gate, and MGM to our movie library. iTunes continues to lead the market for songs purchased and downloaded, accounting for over 85% of the U.S. market, based on the latest data from Nielsen SoundScan.",1
"Now I'd like to turn to our music products and services, which accounted for 44% of total revenue during the quarter. We sold 10.55 million iPods, representing 24% growth over the year-ago quarter. The iPod Shuffle was especially popular, with the addition of four brilliant new colors beginning in late January. The number of iPods in the channel at quarter end was essentially flat sequentially and we ended the quarter comfortably within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.",1
Demand for our Mac Books and Mac Book Pros continued to be very strong. Sales of Mac Notebooks grew 79% year over year during the quarter and accounted for 59% of total Macs sold. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.,1
"I'd like to first talk about our Mac products and services which represented 56% of our total quarterly revenue. We shipped a total of 1.52 million Macs, representing 36% growth over the year-ago quarter. We continue to be very pleased with our Mac sales growth, which was ahead of our expectations, and represented more than three times IDC's latest published industry growth rate estimate for the March quarter.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report strong financial results and the best March quarter in Apple's history. The quarter's revenue was $5.26 billion, representing 21% growth over the prior March quarter's results. The revenue growth was driven by very strong demand for Macs and another great quarter for iPod sales. Operating margin for the quarter was very strong at 18.7%, resulting from stronger than expected revenue and an extremely favorable commodity cost environment. We generated net income of $770 million, which was up 88% over the prior March quarter's results, and translated to earnings per share of $0.87.",1
Use Apple Dashboard.,1
The difference in Europe's overall year-over-year growth versus the company's was principally an increase in channel inventory related to MacBook Pro units being in transit at the end of the quarter that I had spoken about earlier. And so the growth rate looks very similar to the rest of the world.,1
"Thank you. A couple questions. First of all, on the PC unit side of the equation, it looks like you had good growth year over year in Europe, and I was wondering if that may be related to additional distribution locations on the PC?",1
We'll take the next question from Harry Blount of Lehman Brothers.,1
"We don't really talk about the specifics of our commercial deals, but I would tell you that the advantage that we got on Flash pricing during last quarter was one of the keys behind our gross margin meeting the guidance.",1
Okay. Thanks very much for taking my question.,1
Richard Farmer of Merrill Lynch.,1
"Thank you. Three questions, please.",1
"Peter, Iâll take another crack at the iPod hardware gross margin. You've said that it was over 20%. There are a lot of potential numbers above 20. Can you provide any more color there? Was it, for instance, closer to 25 than 20?",1
"Richard, I think the only color that I will go into is that it was sequentially better in the March quarter from December, and above 20%. As we've indicated before, our competitors would just love to know what our specific gross margins are, and shipments by product and by geography, and we just don't want to help them.",1
"Okay. I have two other brief ones, please. If you look at the observed price declines in the Flash contract market, how big of a lag is there typically between those declines and then Apple's ability to take advantage of that pricing in margin in the iPod product?",1
"Okay, and finally a follow-up on boot camp. It seems pretty intuitive that there's going to be a portion of consumers that will switch to Mac as a result of the boot camp. Corporate, in the entrenched Windows environment, seems a little bit different. Do you think that boot camp is in any way going to give you an entrÃ©e into the traditional corporate Windows environment, particularly if you're not supporting Windows? I guess the related question is, do you anticipate ever supporting Windows directly?",1
"In terms of our margin, Iâve provided you very detailed guidance for the June quarter and we're not going to provide an updated business model or future projections, and pleased with the guidance that we've given you this quarter, which includes double-digit operating margin.",1
"We have no desire and no plan to sell or support Windows, but we do think that boot camp makes the Mac even more appealing to Windows users considering making the switch, and that's the reason we put it out. And it is a beta and so we have put it out to get feedback, and weâre just two weeks into that.",1
"Would you agree that's primarily a consumer-oriented addressable market then, that you're really not targeting, given no desire to support Windows directly, you're really not targeting any large corporate Windows environment?",1
"One of the great advantages of the beta is gathering the customers' feedback, and that's where we are in this process.",1
"Thanks, Richard. Can we have the next question, please?",1
Kevin Hunt of Thomas Weisel Partners.,1
"Thanks. I have a couple of things. On a technical detail, can you give us the breakout of the $37 million stock option between R&D and SG&A? And also, I have some questions on the margins. This was your highest gross margin in like five years, and now you've been two quarters in a row over 13% operating margin, which I don't think you were in that high in multiple decades. Can you maybe update us on what the long-term model is that you think you can achieve on a gross margin and operating margin?",1
"And so we feel that this progress in less than 90 days is enormous progress, but I'm not going to predict when we will get through all of that, other than to say weâre on target on the hardware schedule that we had announced earlier.",1
"I don't want to predict beyond the current quarter, and yet weâve given guidance for the current quarter. We are very focused on what we believe are the key factors in getting through the transition, and those are: one, getting all of our hardware moved, and we are on target to do that by the end of the year, as Steve reported earlier at MacWorld; number two, to get our apps universal and weâre pleased to report that the predominant apps in video and audio and our consumer apps are forwarded as of the end of March; number three is working with our developers, and as Peter said earlier, we've had 1500 that are already universal. And 50% of the top 500 will be by the end of April.",1
"Let me try one last one and then I'll cede the floor. You've indicated you think you might have some additional pause in June -- and clearly with the Mac or the iBook pending, that makes sense -- but would that in your mind be the end of any kind of pause at the June quarter?",1
"Frankly, it's very hard to assess the specific impact of it, but we do believe that this is affecting Mac sales, and we're working very closely with Adobe to get the creative suite out as soon as possible.",1
"Well, Adobe has said that their application will be universal with the next release. Casual users of PhotoShop may be satisfied with using PhotoShop with Rosetta. A heavy user of PhotoShop would likely not be satisfied with the performance of Photoshop running under Rosetta.",1
"Tim, would it also be the high end of the iMac, and if Adobe has publicly indicated that they're not going to have their versions ready on natively until '07, how should we be thinking about that impacting? In other words, when do you think the pause ends?",1
"Also, as Peter alluded to in the preamble, we believe that certain Pro customers are delaying their purchase waiting on certain apps, and the Power Mac would clearly be the unit that would be most affected by the Pro customer delay.",1
"The Mac mini only shipped for four weeks of the quarter, or the Intel version of the Mac mini that we began shipping in March. And the compare there is to the launch quarter of a year ago, so it's a very difficult compare.",1
"Keith, when you look at desktops, keep in mind that iMac, Mac Mini, eMac and Power Mac, and as you know, we don't release the specific units on each one of those, but I would share with you that the Intel-based iMac did very well in the quarter.",1
"Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks very much. Peter, Tim, I wanted to go back for a second to the desktop number, if I could. The desktop was out for a good part of the quarter, and as you mentioned in the December quarter, there was a little bit of a pause there in anticipation of the new Intel system. Why do you think the number was still a bit slow? Are you alluding to the software availability as one of the negating factors there? And I have a follow-up, please.",1
"Keith Bachman of Banc of America. Mr. Bachman, your line is open. Please go ahead.",1
"Thanks, Charlie. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"There is a high level of interest, but again, itâs a beta and weâre not releasing the download numbers.",1
"Okay, now has the Beta downloads in the past two weeks been substantial?",1
"Charlie, we just put it out. It's the beta. We will incorporate it in Leopard as we talked about, but the purpose of a beta is to get feedback, and I wouldn't want to speculate about what we would or would not do.",1
"Yes, I want to stay with boot camp. Will Apple add Windows virtualization to the final release in Leopard, or will you leave virtualization to the third parties, such as Parallel?",1
Our next question comes from Charles Wolf of Needham & Company.,1
"Sure. I do not have the breakout with me for the stock comp expense between R&D and SG&A. We did include that last quarter in our press release financials, so you can go and look last quarter and get some indication of what it was then.",1
"Okay, but I think a while a go you did kind of give some margin which I thought was only around 10% or so. So is that what you're saying for the long-term sustainable is, or are you saying I think it comes out to something like 11.5 or so, what youâre saying for the next quarter.",1
"In regards to the iPod points of presence, we now have over 35,000 store fronts across the world. We believe that we are at or near full distribution in the U.S., in some countries in Europe. But we believe there's still opportunity in other countries in Europe, in Japan and Asia and Latin America and Canada. And so we're continuing to find and sign very good channel partners.",1
Weâll take it from Shaw Wu of American Technology.,1
Thank you. I wanted to go into a little bit more detail on your expectations for gross margin next quarter. You mentioned Flash price advantage as a key advantage in your gross margin upside last quarter. What's the relative benefit that you're anticipating for your gross margin guidance for next quarter? And what are other key levers that might help or hurt the June quarter that could surprise one way or the other.,1
"Joel, I'll start and generally talk about the factors that will affect gross margin, and Tim may want to add some further color.",1
"A guiding gross margin down about 140 basis points despite the favorable commodity environment due to several factors: first, the June quarter begins the education buying season, particularly for K to 12 which buys lower ASP and margin Macs; and secondly, we will see the full quarter impact of the iPod Shuffle price reduction that we took in the introduction of the 1GB Nano.",1
"But in terms of the relative benefit of your Flash advantage, is it about the same as it was last quarter?",1
"We don't want to get into the specifics of that, other than to say that we continue to view both LCD and NAND Flash in a very favorable environment for the current quarter.",1
"Thanks, Joel. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"Thanks. Any update on use of cash? I mean, your cash position continues to build -- well, not this specific quarter, but any comment there? Any comments on Braeburn Capital? Thanks.",1
"Well, you can clearly see what weâve reported, and in terms of our guidance on a GAAP basis, including the stock comp expense, we are at 10% plus, and without the stock for the guidance that we provided for the June quarter is over 11%.",1
"All right. Shaw, regarding our use of cash, we are continuing to be conservative with the cash, despite some of the investments we made this quarter. Weâre wanting to retain it for flexibility to invest in the business. We do discuss with the board from time to time share buyback, but don't have a change in philosophy to discuss with you today.",1
"As regards to Braeburn, we are opening an office in Nevada as part of our treasury operations, in addition to our offices in Cupertino, Cork and Singapore.",1
That's it? Thanks.,1
"Thanks, Shaw. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"Good afternoon. First, I was hoping that you could provide kind of a sense as to the Mac units and what percentage of them were Intel-based systems. And then secondly, as you look at the iPod business, where are the points of presence, or where is the number for points presence today? How is that situated between the U.S. market and the international markets? Thanks.",1
"Hi, Steve, it's Tim. Weâre not releasing the exact percentage of Intel versus PowerPC for the quarter of the Mac area, but I can tell you that the shipments of the Intel units did accelerate across the quarter and the majority of shipments that we made in the month of March were Intel based.",1
Joel Wagonfeld of First Albany.,1
We're on target. There's nothing holding it back. Weâre on target to complete by the end of the year as we have now.,1
"Okay, just another question regarding the new MacTel product. Are there any particular issues that are holding back the launch of the rest of the MacTel line that you can talk about?",1
"Well, itâs a question that Iâm really not able to answer, other than to tell you that we are very excited about what we have in the product pipeline, not for iPod for Mac and our whole product pipeline.",1
"Thank you. It's Bill Hand for Andy. Just a couple questions. On the iPod front, I know you can't talk about new products, but any thoughts on potential new directions and future drivers for iPod in the second half, other than perhaps maybe market-share gains internationally?",1
Andy Neff of Bear Stearns.,1
"Thanks, Bill. Can we have the next question, please?",1
The Music Store operated above break even in the March quarter.,1
"Okay, and then final question, can you give us an update on the profitability of the Music Store?",1
"Well, we believe that the French implementation of the EU copyright directive will result in state-sponsored piracy, and if this happens, we believe legal music sales will plummet just when legitimate alternatives to piracy are winning customers over. We don't think that the proposed French legislation would be good for anyone.",1
"Okay, and one more question. Thereâs been a lot of press on the DRM law proposals in France. Can you give us a read on what you view the potential risks are here to the Apple business model longer term, and whether you think there is a risk that this could spread to other countries?",1
"There's no significant constraint in the market that we're experiencing. Factored into the guidance that Peter gave you is a favorable pricing environment for both LCD and NAND Flash, where supply continues to exceed the demand. We expect optical drives and hard drives to track to historical trends, and DRAM pricing, we expect to trade in a relatively narrow range.",1
"Great, thank you. Could you give us your outlook for the component prices in the June quarter, and are any components currently constrained?",1
The next question comes from Bill Shope of JP Morgan.,1
"Thanks, Kevin. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"No, and that was one of the three factors that allowed us to do better on gross margin than what we had guided to. We had planned for some price reductions and many of the transitioning PowerPC models, and used very little of it.",1
"Okay, one last question. Did you have any significant discounting of the older G4 models in the quarter?",1
"Keith, it is really hard for me to do year-over-year gross margin comparisons because youâve got your different points and your product cycles, different commodity cycles, different mix. And thatâs why weâve traditionally talked about gross margin on a sequential detail and I would prefer to just stick with the sequential comments that I gave you, which again gross margin was better than what we thought it would be.",1
"Fair enough. Then last question for me then, Peter, if you -- you have your operating segments and if you thought about is there a deviation in the operating segments and the amount of gross margin they report by geography? In other words, was the variance in terms of the individual geographies materially different than what you had as a company as a whole?",1
Weâll put out the 10-Q in the next week or so and our segment reporting at the gross margin level will be there. You can look at prior 10-Qs to see the different gross margins in the segments. And thereâs a little bit of variability but we are quite happy with each of our segments.,1
"Sorry, I wasn't trying to be unclear. I'm saying that as of today, we currently do not anticipate any material supply or cost, in fact, as far as that goes in our fiscal Q3. That's the quarter that we're in now that ends in June. Beyond June, there are risks but there's no issue that we're aware of today that we view as unsolvable. However, new things could happen and I'm sure you've been paying attention to the news. There's aftershocks, there's still uncertainty about the nuclear plant, there's power interruptions. If that stayed at the level it is today, I'm not as worried. I would worry if something happened and took a turn for the worse. And obviously, I can't predict that and certainly hope that it does not occur.",1
"Thank you. For the last several years, we've seen a new iPhone in June and we've seen a new iPod models in September. Can you maybe just share some of your views on how you've historically viewed that 1 year time horizon for new products, and maybe talk about what might cause that kind of a time line to change?",1
"We don't -- we never comment on an Apps products, and so I don't have anything to share from that perspective.",1
"And then can you -- you've touched on it a little bit, but can you maybe give some updated thoughts on how you view the supply-demand balance right now for the iPhone? You've talked a bit about it with iPad but 1 of the things that really stuck out to me in the last few quarters is your -- just the demand has been so great globally, especially if you've added new carriers that you still haven't met demand for the iPhone. Can you maybe just give some updated thoughts on that?",1
"Yes, that's a good question. We -- by the end of the quarter, we were in supply-demand balance in almost all of our major markets. And I would say as of today, we're in supply-demand balance virtually everywhere. The other products, the Mac is in supply-demand balance and the iPod is in supply-demand balance. And the iPad has the mother of all backlogs that we're working very, very hard to get out to customers as quickly as we can.",1
"From Pacific Crest, we'll go to Andy Hargreaves.",1
"Thanks. Just going back to the supply stuff real quick. Can you clarify -- would it require some kind of new disruption to cause problems beyond fiscal Q3, or were your comments just that we could kind of run low on inventory, and if production doesn't get back to full capacity, there could be issues later in the year?",1
"Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks. And then just on the iPhone, you talked a lot about the number of new Mac customers every quarter. Can you give us any help on what the mix is of replacement sales versus new customers, or what your total user base is there?",1
"1 thing I would add to that, this was surprising to me and I think several people here is, K-12 is sort of even more conservative than Enterprise on adopting new technology. And last quarter, we were about a 1:1 ratio of iPads to Macs, which is I think very -- is amazing with the short life of the iPad, and really demonstrates what kind of opportunity there probably is there.",1
"It's a number that we haven't given out before, and so it's a number that we hold tight to the best.",1
"Thanks, Andy.",1
We'll go to Shaw Wu with Sterne Agee.,1
"Thanks for having me on. Just 2 quick ones. Just back on components, it seems if you look at other vendors and spot pricing, component pricing has actually been increasing. I just wanted a little more color why Apple has been able to beat that. I know you're a very well-run company, obviously. Just a little more color on that.",1
"Yes, it's a good question, Shaw. Certainly, spot markets have spiked. This is particularly true if you follow the NAND Flash and the DRAM markets. However, we do not typically buy in the spot market. And so, for that reason, we see very minimal impact. Beyond Q3, I'm saying I'm not sure because it's tough to see that far, but for Q3, we feel very good. Companies that buy on the spot market would obviously be seeing something extremely differently than we would.",1
"Okay, thanks for the color on that. And then just on the iPad, in terms of the selling model, does it make sense or is there interest in terms of having it subsidized by service providers at some point?",1
Brian Blair with Wedge Partners.,1
"It's a difficult funding environment for schools here in the U.S. We don't see any evidence of a share loss. And Macs are very of popular in schools and iPads are proving to be as well. On a year-over-year basis, we would expect to see a sequential -- I'm sorry, a year-over-year very significant increase in Mac sales, and I'm very confident about the product lines as we head into the back-to-school season.",1
"Yes, thanks very much. It may not be a perfect analogy but just wondering with the rise of Android, what might be some of the similarities and differences you see versus the rise of Windows PCs in the 1990s versus Mac? And I'm just wondering if you think in the U.S., particularly Android, could become a possible headwind to your U.S. smartphone business, and how do you maintain such incredible growth in the space of that shift?",1
"He is still on medical leave, as you say, but we do see him on a regular basis. And as we previously said, he continues to be involved in major strategic decisions. And I know he wants to be back full-time as soon as he can.",1
"Thank you, Mike.",1
"And a question first on the iPhone. Demand, obviously, has been phenomenal. And if we look down the road at the opportunity in the post- versus the prepaid markets, are there any considerations that you can share in terms of -- that you weigh, in terms of price or subsidies or growing market share in this large prepaid market?",1
"Gene, it's Tim. Our focus has very much been on China. We wanted to understand that market and understand the levers there. And as I said before, we're -- iPhone sales were up over 3x during the quarter. And in the first half, we did over 5 -- just slightly under $5 billion in Greater China in revenue, which is about 10% of Apple, to put it in perspective. And it wasn't but a couple of years ago that, that number would have been less than 2. And so it's a sea change. And that's certainly not, what I would call, a classic post-pay market by any means of the imagination. And so we have some ideas about other countries as well. I'm not in a position that I want to share those today. But we purposely put the bulk of our emphasis from an emerging market point of view on China to really learn, and then we're going to take that learning to other markets.",1
"Would you know if China, if more than half of -- do you know if more than half of China is prepaid?",1
"I think considerably more than half of China's prepaid, Gene. I think the first digit would start with a 9.",1
"Okay. Very, very good. And then separately, it's great to see Steve attending the iPad 2 event. And since going on medical leave, how closely has he stayed involved with the company's decisions, and do you have any idea when he might return?",1
"I wanted to revisit the supply question on both iPhone and iPad. So last quarter, you were chasing iPhone demand, and you said you're going to work as hard as possible to try and make sure you catch up with your demand, and given the inventory build, it sounds like you're comfortable and you've gotten there. On the iPad side, it's a little less clear to me. You made, I guess, over 7 million iPads in last quarter in fiscal Q1. This quarter, including the inventory drawdown, maybe there were 5.1 million made. So was this -- I mean, you've proven that you have the capacity or the relationships to build a lot more. Was this simply a forecasting error on the iPad side? And can you comment about linearity of demand and why you couldn't have kept production at a similar rate to the prior quarter and been able to fulfill a lot more?",1
"Secondly, the follow-up on the sequential revenue guidance question. Can you provide any color what you expect from Macs, particularly as we enter the educational buying season? Have you seen any pressure on school budgets that is creating a little caution with respect to your Mac business?",1
"Let me mention a few things for you to consider, Toni. First off, product transitions are never simple. And as you can probably appreciate, we are in a position that we have to call them for many, many weeks in advance in terms of how many of the current product we want to produce and the dates at which we will announce the new product. We drew the channel down on the current product or the original iPad, I should say, by 570,000 units during the quarter. And we added at the end of the quarter 170,000 of the new iPad 2s although most of that was in transit at the end of the quarter. And so the net reduction was $400,000. And so our sell-through was above $5 million for the quarter. And again, this has to be planned quite a ways in the future. I think the key point here is -- also the dates, just to remind you, we set out an invitation to the event toward the end of February. We had the event in early March. We placed the unit on sale in the United States on March 11 and our quarter ended about 2 weeks thereafter. And so there was some expectation of a new product, and we would have obviously factored that into our thinking about the product transition as we plan the number of the original unit to build. And so I think the key point here is that I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we were making on the manufacturing ramp. We have gotten off to a materially better start and produced a lot more units than we did on the original ramp of the first iPad. And when we're so confident with our ability to supply that we've already put on 25 additional countries at the end of March, and we'll be placing on 13 more next week and we'll do even more as we stepped through the quarter.",1
"Okay. That's helpful. If I could turn to another topic, which is just your overall guidance for next quarter on the revenue and EPS side. If I look back at your last 8 quarters, Q2 to Q3, last 8 years. 7 of the 8, you've been flat to up in revenues. And 8 out of 8, you've been up in EPS sequentially from Q2 to Q3. On both those metrics, you're providing guidance that is dramatically down double digits. Can you comment on forces at work? Obviously, you're typically pretty conservative in your guidance. But what are the things that are kind of underpinning those directionally, those assumptions, particularly since you're pointing to a dramatic increase in iPads?",1
"Sure. Toni, it's Peter. Let me start with top line. I would highlight 2 things. First of all, our sequential revenue guidance of $23 million is for a 7% decline, and it have been up in prior years. And 2 things to point out: first of all, in our most recent March quarter, we were able to increase the iPhone channel inventory by 1.7 million units and within our target range. And that had not occurred in any of the prior years. And second, last year, we launched the iPad in the year ago June quarter, and it was a fabulous launch contributing $2.2 billion in revenue without a comparison to the prior March quarter, and we obviously have that comparison this year. On a year-over-year basis, I am very pleased we're providing revenue guidance for growth of 46% year-over-year and EPS growing almost as quickly at 43%.",1
"Thanks, Toni.",1
Thanks very much. Just a follow-up on the iPad question. Can you give us a split of iPad 2 versus iPad 1 as a percentage of the 5 million you shipped in the March quarter?,1
"We purposely aren't giving that because we don't want to help out any of our competition. But I would tell you, I wish we could have produced a lot more iPad 2s because there were certainly a lot of people waiting for them.",1
"The iPad today is subsidized in a few markets. It is subsidized in Korea if people sign a 24-month contract, it's subsidized in Japan with a 24-month contract and a couple of European countries. But the vast majority of people that are using the iPad on 3G are doing so on a pay-as-you-go plan and no commitment plan. And so, yes, carriers can do that but I think many customers prefer the pay-as-you-go plan.",1
"Thank you, Shaw.",1
"From UBS, we'll go to Maynard Um.",1
"Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $6.6 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 132%. We ended the quarter with about 2 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential decrease of about 300,000 units, which placed us below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory.",1
"The iTunes Store generated all-time record results with revenue of almost $1.9 billion in the March quarter, an increase of 35% year-over-year, thanks to continued strong sales of music, video and apps. We now have a catalog of over 28 million songs and 45,000 movies.",1
"I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to sell 35.1 million iPhones compared to 18.6 million in the previous March quarter. That represents 88% year-over-year growth compared to 42% growth for the smartphone market overall in the March quarter based on the latest published estimate from IDC. We experienced very strong iPhone sales growth in all of our segments, led by our Asia Pacific and Japan segments where sales more than doubled year-over-year. We continue to see tremendous momentum in Greater China, where iPhone sales were 5x the level of the year ago quarter, aided by the launch of the iPhone 4S in China in January and the addition of China Telecom as an iPhone carrier in March. IPhone 4S is now available in over 100 countries and is sold through over 230 carriers.",1
"We ended the quarter with about 8.6 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 2.6 million units, which placed us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory.",1
"Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $22.7 billion during the quarter compared to $12.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 85%.",1
"iPhone momentum in the enterprise has evolved beyond email, calendar and contacts. IT and business line managers across industries see the opportunity to leverage both company and employee-owned devices to improve productivity and efficiencies through iOS in-house app development. In fact, the majority of the Fortune 500 companies who have approved iPhone on their networks are members of the iOS Developer Enterprise Program and are actively deploying in-house applications to their employee base.",1
"Turning to iPad. We were very pleased with sales of 11.8 million iPads during the March quarter compared to 4.7 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 151%. Customers are loving the new iPad with its stunning Retina display, A5X chip with Quad-core graphics and the 5-megapixel iSight camera. The new iPad is now available in over 40 countries, and we saw a very strong growth in iPad sales around the world with sales more than doubling in each of our segments.",1
"The education market's interest in iPad continues to grow. In the March quarter, we sold more than 2 iPads for every Mac to our U.S. K-12 customers while also generating a record quarter for Mac sales. The San Diego School District purchased 10,000 iPads in the March quarter and plans to purchase over 15,000 more in the June quarter for middle school and high school programs.",1
"Thank you. 2 questions. Last year, when you gave gross margin guidance for the fiscal third quarter, I think you -- 1 thing you mentioned was a new product transition that would impact the gross margins. Just curious if that's also a factor. You didn't mention that. And then secondly, if you could just talk a little bit about the suit against Samsung. I'm just wondering how that might impact anything on your component-supply relationship? Thanks.",1
"iPad continues to open doors to new customers with whom Apple previously had no relationship. As we enter the K-12 institution buying season, we're hopeful that iPad will be a popular choice.",1
"iPad's momentum in business and government also continues to build. The United States Air Force Air Mobility Command is deploying thousands of iPads to serve as electronic flight bags, storing technical publications and operations information for flight crew members and trainers. Companies such as Bechtel and Balfour Beatty are using iPads in the field for project management and viewing blueprints. And thousands of iPads are being deployed as mobile sales tools by companies such as Roche, Amgen, Bayer and Daiichi Sankyo. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed 365 cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 50 million in the March quarter. The iOS ecosystem continues to expand and thrive with stores in more than 120 countries.",1
"The App Store now offers more than 600,000 apps, including over 200,000 apps specifically for iPad. We were very excited to announce the download of the 25th billionth app in March less than 4 years after the launch of the App Store.",1
"And iCloud is off to an incredible start, currently with more than 125 million customers signed up since its launch in October.",1
"I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which also generated record March quarter results. Revenue was $4.4 billion, an increase of 38% over the year ago quarter and was second only to the record quarterly revenue generated in the December quarter. The stores experienced very strong year-over-year growth in iPad and iPhone sales, and they sold 826,000 Macs compared to 797,000 in the year ago quarter. And about half the Macs sold in our stores during the March quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.",1
"We opened 2 new stores in the quarter, including our first Netherlands store in Amsterdam and a beautiful new store in Houston. We exited the quarter with 363 stores, nearly 1/3 of which are outside the United States. With an average of 361 stores open, average revenue per store was $12.2 million compared to $9.9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 23%. Segment margin reached a new March quarter record of over $1.1 billion, which was 26.1% of retail revenue. We welcomed 85 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to 71 million visitors in the year ago quarter, an increase of 19%. That translates to an average of 18,000 visitors per store per week.",1
We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory.,1
"Moving to our music products. We sold 7.7 million iPods compared to 9 million in the year ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations, and iPod touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD, and iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.",1
"In February, we released the developer preview of Mountain Lion, the ninth major release of Mac OS X. Mountain Lion will bring popular apps and features from iPad to the Mac, including Messages, Notes, Reminders, Game Center, Notification Center, Share Sheets, Twitter integration and AirPlay Mirroring. We expect Mountain Lion to be available from the Mac App Store in late summer this year.",1
"Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established new March quarter records for both desktops and portables, combining for a total of 4 million Macs sold. This represents growth of 7% year-over-year compared to IDC's latest published forecast of 2% growth for the global personal computer market in the March quarter. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory, which is below our target range of 4 to 5 weeks.",1
"Operating margin was $15.4 billion, representing 39.3% of revenue. Net income was $11.6 billion, increasing 94% over the prior March quarter's result. The quarter's net income translated to earnings per share of $12.30.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $39.2 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 59%. That's a new record for a March quarter and is second only to the all-time record revenue we reported in the most recent December quarter. The year-over-year increase in March quarter revenue was fueled primarily by very strong growth in iPhone and iPad sales.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. We're very pleased to report the results of our outstanding second fiscal quarter. We established new March quarter records for iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, leading to our highest March quarter revenue and earnings ever.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2011, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1
"Thanks, Mark. A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks. It's podcast on the iTunes Store as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are (888) 203-1112 or (719) 457-0820. Confirmation code is 8218881. These replays will be available beginning at approximately 5 p.m. Pacific Time today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at (408) 974-1896 and financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at (408) 974-4570, and I'm at (408) 974-5420. Thanks again for joining us.",1
"I'll take both your questions. We don't talk about what we'll do in the future, so I'm quite limited to what we can say about the future of iTunes. We operate the most popular store in the world, giving customers a fabulous experience. We have the largest libraries and have provided more content to more customers than anybody. We're very confident about what we're doing and what we will do in the future. I can't take it beyond there. In terms of OpEx, we've provided guidance for the June quarter, about $2.5 billion, and that includes our thinking for the investment that we're going to make in the quarter for the business. We are investing in engineering, in our retail stores, we are investing in our indirect distribution, which it would include covering the enterprise and the infrastructure investment that we need to support the terrific growth that you're seeing from the company. I'm glad that we are making good investments that are paying off but also providing -- continuing to provide leverage in the model.",1
"Yes, thanks. Tim, you mentioned earlier about the success of the iTunes here. Can you talk a little philosophically about what will be [ph] the next to really optimize that platform in terms of cloud-like capabilities? And then, Peter, the question for you is really around the OpEx. How should we think about OpEx? Does your guidance already imply that you will have to increase some S&M employees to serve these greater region enterprises? Or is that already kind of in the model?",1
We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JP Morgan.,1
"Thank you, Maynard.",1
cided we needed to rely on the courts.,1
"And on your question on Samsung, we are Samsung's largest customer and Samsung is a very valued component supplier to us, and I expect the strong relationship will continue. Separately from this, we felt the Mobile Communication Division of Samsung had crossed the line. And after trying for some time to work the issue, we de",1
"I'll take your gross margin question, it's Peter. It's hard for us to comment on gross margin changes year-over-year because we're in different product cycles, commodity environments, different mixes and other factors. So I prefer just to talk about it sequentially, and I gave you really the biggest drivers of the change that we see. We expect to have a sequential increase in terms of our mix of iPad sales and also expect our revenues to be down sequentially a little bit and to lose some leverage. So those are the factors that I think are important on a sequential basis for those margin.",1
"I think, Mike, I just saw yesterday -- it's interesting you should point out the U.S. The comScore data released yesterday reported that the iOS platform outreaches Android by 59% in the U.S., and so this is an enormous percentage. On a worldwide basis, we just did 18.6 million iPhones, which is up 113%, which is materially faster than the market rate of growth. And we launched the iPad 2 and sold everyone of them that we could make. As we've said before, we're gaining traction in Enterprise on both the iPhone and iPad with astonishing 88% and 75%, respectively, of the Fortune 500 companies deploying or testing these. We've got the largest App Store with over 350,000 apps for iPhone and over 65,000 iPad-specific apps on iOS versus what appears to be fewer than 100 on Android. And so we feel very, very good about where we are and we feel great about our future product plan. We've also paid over $2 billion to developers, and we've had well over 10 billion applications downloaded. And so our business proposition is very, very strong. And as we've said before, we continue to believe and even more and more everyday that iPhone's integrated approach is materially better than Android's fragmented approach, where you have multiple OSs on multiple devices with different screen resolutions and multiple app stores with different roles, payment methods and update strategies. I think the user appreciates that Apple can take full responsibility for their experience, whereas the fragmented approach turns the customer into a systems integrator and few customers that I know want to be a systems integrator.",1
We'll go to Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.,1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking today is Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer; and he'll be joined by Apple COO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&A session with the analysts.",1
"In closing, we're thrilled with the results and accomplishments of our record March quarter. We're extremely pleased with customers' response to iPad 2 and are working hard to get it into the hands of customers as fast as we can. We remain very confident in our strategy and are very excited about our new product pipeline.",1
"To further enrich our Apple retail customer experience, we recently launched a program called Personal Setup. When customers buy a Mac, iPad, iPhone or iPod touch, our teams help the customer set up the product in the store so that they are up and running before they leave. Personal Setup includes the customer's e-mail, contacts, calendar, applications and more. In the March quarter, our stores set up over 1 million products. We operated 323 stores during the quarter. Average revenue per store was $9.9 million compared to $5.9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 67%. International retail store sales remain strong with our average international store volume exceeding our very productive average U.S. store volume.",1
"Retail segment margin more than doubled year-over-year to $807 million compared to $373 million in the year ago quarter. We anticipate opening 40 new stores in fiscal 2011, nearly 3 quarters of which will be outside the United States, including our fifth store in China.",1
"Total company gross margin was 41.4%, which was 290 basis points higher than our guidance. More than half of this difference came from better product mix than planned, particularly higher iPhone sales. The remainder was largely a result of leverage on the higher revenue and lower-than-expected commodity, service and other costs.",1
"Operating expenses were $2.34 billion and included $236 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $26 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 24.2%, below our guidance of 25.5% due to changes in our full year forecast of foreign earnings, R&D tax credit and state taxes.",1
"Turning to cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $65.8 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to $59.7 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $6.2 billion, an increase of 167% year-over-year. The increase in cash is net of approximately $900 million to combine prepayments and capital expenditures related to the strategic supply agreements that we referred to in our last quarterly call.",1
"As we move into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $23 billion compared to $15.7 billion in the June quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 38%, reflecting approximately $55 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.5 billion, including about $255 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be about $70 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 25%. We are targeting EPS of about $5.03.",1
"And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1
"I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. We are approaching the Retail Stores 10th anniversary on May 19, and we're on the verge of achieving a major milestone. In the next few days, we will be thrilled to welcome our 1 billionth visitor. Store traffic continues to be amazingly strong. And in the March quarter, we hosted a record 71.1 million visitors in our stores compared to 47 million visitors in the year ago quarter, an increase of 51%.",1
"Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?",1
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.,1
"Okay, great. Thanks. Can you comment, Peter, on whether or not you're seeing any supply chain disruptions from the recent earthquake in Japan. And if so, how should we think about that in terms of that being factored in your guidance?",1
"Bill, this is Tim. Let me sort of step back and talk about Japan in general and sort of try to get all of your questions in advance. First of all, this is an incredible tragedy and our hearts go out to everyone involved. Apple, as a company, has a very long history and has many strong ties to people in Japan, and we're very, very saddened by the situation, and we've undertaken various actions to assist in the relief effort. The economic impact that we'll address today pales in comparison to the human impact. Regarding our business in Japan, we had some revenue impact in Q2 but it was not material to Apple's consolidated results. We believe revenues will be approximately $200 million less in Q3, and this has been factored into the guidance that Peter provided you earlier in his comments. Regarding our global supply chain, as a result of outstanding teamwork and unprecedented resilience of our partners, we did not have any supply or cost impact in our fiscal Q2 as a result of the tragedy, and we currently do not anticipate any material supply or cost impact in our fiscal Q3. To provide a bit more color on this, we sourced hundreds, literally hundreds of items from Japan, and they range from components such as LCDs, optical drives, NAND Flash and DRAM to base materials such as resins, coatings and foil that are part of the production process at several layers back in the supply chain. The earthquake and subsequent tsunami and the associated nuclear crisis caused disruption for many of these suppliers, and many unaffected suppliers have been impacted by power interruptions. But since the disaster, Apple employees have literally been working around the clock with our supplier partners in Japan, and have been able to implement a number of contingency plans. Our preference from the beginning of this tragedy has been to remain with our long-term partners in Japan. And I have to say, they have displayed an incredible resilience that I personally never seen before in the aftermath of this disaster. So while we do not anticipate -- currently anticipate any material impact to our component supply or cost in our fiscal Q3, we do need to caution everyone that the situation remains unpredictable given recent aftershocks, the uncertainty about the nuclear plant and potential power interruptions. Further, there are some supply risks that are beyond the current quarter. And although we know of no issue today that we view as unsolvable, the situation is still uncertain and there's obviously no guarantees. For this reason, it's difficult to predict whether the issues created by the tragedy would impact revenues beyond Q3. However, I'll be happy to address Q4 on our next call in July.",1
"Okay, great. That was very helpful. I guess digging into another area of supply, looking at your iPad 2 constraints since launch in March, can you give us some color on where the constraints lie and how you're doing in terms of getting supply back in line with demand?",1
"Well, the demand on iPad 2 has been staggering. And we're still amazed that we are still heavily backlogged not only at the end of the quarter but also up to date. However, I can tell you that I'm extremely pleased with the progress of the manufacturing ramp, and we were so confident that we rolled out to 25 additional countries at the end of last month. And we are shipping to an additional 13 countries next week, and we're planning to add even more countries through the quarter. And so I'm very confident that we can produce a very large number of iPads for the quarter.",1
"Retail revenue was $3.19 billion compared to $1.68 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 90%. Capitalizing on the February MacBook Pro update, the stores delivered another record Mac quarter, selling 797,000 Macs compared to 606,000 Macs in the year ago quarter, an increase of 32%, and about half the Macs sold in our stores during the March quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.",1
"The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 350,000 apps available and well over 10 billion downloads to date. In February, we announced a new subscription service available to all publishers of content-based apps, including magazines, newspapers, video and music. Publishers set the price and length of subscription and customers select the subscription and length they want with 1 click. And it was also a great pleasure to announce in March that we have made more than $2 billion in payments to developers since opening the App Store.",1
"Thanks, Scott.",1
"We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory. The iTunes Store turned in its best quarter ever with revenue of almost $1.4 billion, thanks to record revenue from music, video, iOS apps and books. We were very pleased to begin offering a full catalog of 17,000 ebooks from Random House on the iBookstore during the March quarter. The iBookstore now includes ebooks for more than 2,500 publishers in over 20 categories, and customers have downloaded over 100 million books.",1
"With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the highest March quarter revenue and earnings in Apple's history. We set a new all-time quarterly record for iPhone sales, and a new March quarter record for Mac sales, and we're thrilled with the momentum for iPad.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $24.7 billion, which was $11.2 billion over the prior March quarter's result and represents the largest year-over-year quarterly revenue growth we've ever generated. This tremendous increase of 83% was fueled primarily by record iPhone sales, very robust demand for iPad and strong growth in Mac sales. Operating margin was an all-time high of almost $7.9 billion, representing 31.9% of revenue. Net income was almost $6 billion. This represented 95% growth over the year gross quarter's earnings and translated to earnings per share of $6.40.",1
"Turning to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new March quarter record with sales of 3.76 million Macs, representing 28% growth over the year ago quarter. We're extremely pleased with this very strong growth, particularly given IDC's most recently published estimate of a 3% contraction for the PC market overall. This result makes the March quarter the 20th consecutive quarter that we outperformed the PC market. We experienced strong Mac sales growth in each of our operating segments, most notably in the Asia-Pacific segment, where Mac sales increased 76% year-over-year. The growth in Mac sales was fueled primarily by the continued great popularity of MacBook Air, which was updated in the December quarter, as well as very strong sales of MacBook Pro. We updated the entire MacBook Pro family during the March quarter with the next-generation processors and graphics, high-speed Thunderbolt I/O technology and a new FaceTime HD camera.",1
"The new MacBook Pro lineup offers twice the speed of the previous generation and customer response has been excellent. We began at the end of the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory. During the quarter, we released the developer preview of Mac OS X Lion, which takes some of the best ideas from the iPad and brings them back to the Mac. Lion features Mission Control an innovative new view of everything running on the Mac. Launchpad, a new home for all your Mac Apps, full screen apps that use the entire Mac display and new multi-touch gestures. Lion is scheduled to ship to customers this summer and we look forward to showing more of its great features at our Developers Conference in June.",1
"Moving to our music products. We sold 9 million iPods compared to 10.9 million in the year ago quarter. Though lower year-over-year, total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations with iPod touch continuing to count for over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD, and iPod continue to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.",1
"I'd now like to turn to the iPhone. We were thrilled to have sold a record 18.6 million iPhones compared to 8.8 million in the previous March quarter. This represents 113% year-over-year growth which is significantly ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 74% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the March quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $12.3 billion during the quarter compared to $5.45 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 126%. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year iPhone sales growth in all of our operating segments with sales in both the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions more than doubling year-over-year.",1
"Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we reached just under 189 million cumulative iOS device sales through the end of the March quarter. In March, we introduced iOS 4.3 with new features including faster Safari mobile browsing performance with the Java Nitro script engine, iTunes Home Sharing, enhancements to AirPlay and the Personal Hotspot feature for sharing an iPhone 4 cellular data connection over Wi-Fi.",1
"We were able to make a significant increase in our capacity, once again, allowing us to expand distribution and get much-needed supply to our channel partners. We were very pleased to begin selling iPhones on the Verizon network in the U.S. in the March quarter, and we were also happy to add SK Telecom in Korea, as well as Saudi Telecom in Saudi Arabia. Including some carrier consolidation, we ended the quarter with iPhone distribution through 186 carriers in 90 countries.",1
"We ended the quarter with about 5.2 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.7 million to support new carrier launches and existing channel partners. This placed us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. iPhone is continuing to see strong growth within the Enterprise segment. Today, 88% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPhone.",1
"With strong employee demand and custom app development fueling adoption, we are seeing great scale of iPhone deployments in businesses worldwide. In fact, hundreds of private and public companies worldwide are supporting thousands of iPhones on their corporate networks. Some examples include Cisco, Prudential, Boston Scientific, General Motors, American Airlines, Deloitte, Yum! Brands and Xerox.",1
"Turning to iPad, we continue to be thrilled with its momentum. We sold 4.7 million iPads during the March quarter, launching iPad 2 in U.S. on March 11 and in 25 additional countries on March 25. Customer enthusiasm has been tremendous for iPad 2 and we're working hard to get it into the hands of customers as quickly as possible.",1
"Including both the original iPad and iPad 2, we had distribution in 59 countries by the end of the March quarter. Given the very strong customer demand and despite the increased geographic distribution, iPod (sic) [iPad] channel inventory declined by 400,000 from the beginning of the quarter, implying sell-through of about 5.1 million. This resulted in ending channel inventory of below 850,000, which was below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks. We sold every iPad 2 that we could make during the quarter and would have liked to end the quarter with more channel inventory. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $2.8 billion.",1
"Employee demand for iPad in the corporate environment remains strong and CIOs continue to embrace iPad in an unprecedented rate. In just over a year since its debut, 75% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPad within their enterprises. Some recent examples of enterprises that are deploying iPad include FORTUNE 500 companies such as Xerox, AutoNation, Yum! Brands, ADP, Boston Scientific, EstÃ©e Lauder, Disney, Stryker, Prudential Financial, Rite Aid and USAA.",1
"Okay, great. Thanks. I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on what drove the iPhone's strength in the quarter? If you could, by region or carrier, you mentioned that you added SK Telecom, and I'm not sure if shipments there were material during the quarter. And then, Peter, the follow-up to that I guess is, how do we think about iPhone seasonality going into the June quarter giving all of the moving parts? We have a full quarter of Verizon. In the June quarter, you've got some potential carrier expansion benefit and yet, you have a product refresh hopefully coming midyear, so I was hoping you could help us think about that a little bit for the June quarter. Thanks.",1
"Rich, it's Tim. In terms of iPhone, we did actually very well everywhere. I'd call out 2 places that -- where it was just off the charts. The U.S. grew 155% year-over-year, obviously, adding Verizon and beginning to offer iPhone to their enormous customer base was key in that. However, as you heard from AT&T's announcement this morning, AT&T did extremely well during the quarter. So the U.S. as a geography grew at 155% and that's about 3x IDC's forecast of growth for the smartphone market, which was about 48%. Also, we continued to be on a tear in China. Greater China saw iPhone sales being up over 3x, about 200 -- almost 250%. And this catapulted revenue for the first half or first fiscal half in Greater China to just under $5 billion, which is up almost 4x year-over-year. And so we're extremely happy with how we're doing in China.",1
"Rich, and to hit the second part of your question. As I commented in my prepared remarks, we were able to increase the iPhone channel inventory by just over 1.7 million units in the March quarter, and we ended within our target, 4 to 6 week range of inventory. In terms of the June quarter, I would expect to see a significant year-over-year increase in sales.",1
"Sure. Ben, it's Peter. For competitive reasons, I don't want to provide any more precise ASPs for either of these products. We just don't want to help our competitors. But on the data summary, we provide you both the iPhone and iPad units that we shipped and revenues, which include the accessories that you can make your own estimate.",1
"Okay. And then perhaps 1 for Tim on my follow-up related to Shannon's question, how are you seeing different opportunities in the large enterprises with your MacBook in traditional markets of U.S. and Western Europe, given the seemingly greater receptiveness towards your iPhones, and what will be the tablets, I think. In other words, is that opening doors to go ahead and get the Macs in with CIOs?",1
It clearly seems to be creating a halo effect for the Mac. And I think that's 1 reason we see the growth that we are seeing on the Mac. It's amazing when you see the 28% year-over-year versus the worldwide market in PCs contracting by 3 points. It's an astonishing delta.,1
"Right, right. Okay, thanks very much guys.",1
Thanks Keith.,1
"From Barclays, we'll hear from Ben Reitzes.",1
"Yes, thanks a lot. Can you talk about the ASP trends for the iPad and the iPhone? What were they in the quarter? And are there any dynamics that would change that as we move throughout the year or at least into the June quarter?",1
Okay. And I guess my other question was with regard to the iPad constraints. When do you think that you'll be to equilibrium or have channel inventory where you need it to be? You were able to say that you increased production a lot for the iPhone. When can you say at least the same thing for the iPad where you feel like you've alleviated your shortage?,1
"And any comment on the sequential, Peter?",1
"Ben, what I would say is this, I am confident we're going to produce a very large number for the quarter. Whether that will be enough to meet demand, I don't know. Demand has been staggering. I'm not going to predict when supply and demand will come into balance. I can only be confident on the supply side.",1
"Thank you, Ben.",1
We'll hear from Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.,1
"Thanks. Tim, can you maybe talk a little bit about the CDMA phone and maybe specifically, which new markets you're looking at entering with CDMA over the next couple of quarters? And then with regards to the facility investments, can you maybe talk about the magnitude of spending you expect as you go through the year on -- with the partners, I mean, sort of in investments both on a CapEx side that you're making as well as overall investments? Thanks.",1
"On the carrier side, I don't want to get into specifics about the CDMA or GSM for that matter. But we are constantly looking at where we should bring on incremental partners. And as we have said earlier, we brought on 3 this quarter, 3 large ones with Verizon, SKT and Saudi Telecom. That's on top of the ones that we brought on in December where we added O2 and Vodafone in Germany. And so we are constantly looking and adding where it makes sense, and you can keep confidence that we'll continue to do that.",1
"Scott, on your capital question, a couple of updates. We expect to spend in our fiscal '11 about $5.7 billion in capital expenditures. That's unchanged from what we told you last quarter. We expect about $700 million of that to be in our retail area and $5 billion outside of retail. Some of the bigger areas outside of retail and the biggest is in the operations area. We talked about on the last call arrangements we had done with 3 suppliers. We expect to spend about $3.5 billion during fiscal '11 and fiscal '12 with those 3 suppliers on those deals in the form of prepayments and capital expenditures. And as I said in my prepared comments, we expected $900 million of that in the March quarter, and we expect to spend the remainder across fiscal '11 and fiscal '12.",1
"Sure. Sequential decline is primarily being driven by the higher mix of iPad sales, which, as you know, we priced very aggressively to capitalize on our first mover advantage. Additionally, we would expect to lose some leverage from the lower sequential revenue. And as I pointed out in my prepared remarks in a moment ago, the iPhone channel inventory increased by 1.7 million units in the March quarter. It acts within our 4 to 6 week range. Conversely, the iPad channel inventory fell by 400,000 units, and we were below our 4 to 6 week inventory range. So those are the forces I would highlight.",1
"Peter: Could you talk a little bit about the forces impacting your sequential decline and gross margins by, call it, 350 basis points? What are the forces that you're -- want to call out and things that we should be thinking about? Thank you.",1
"From Bank of MontrÃ©al, we'll go to Keith Bachman.",1
"Thanks, Shannon.",1
"There are several of the international countries that are extremely portable focused. And you can see that we had enormous growth in our portables for the quarter. However, part of that is that we had a launch of the new MacBook Pro line. But honestly, I see popularity in both the iMac and the portable factor, and believe there is a great future for both of them.",1
"Thank you. Has there been any difference between sort of portable versus desktop purchases internationally, or is it sort of trending in line with what you've seen in the U.S.?",1
"Yes, if you look at it, Shannon, the growth on the Mac has been enormous in Asia. The last quarter, we were up 76% in Asia-Pacific. And yes, this is many multiples of the growth that the -- that region is seeing for the market. I believe the IDC forecast is around 6%. And so we're seeing enormous growth in the Mac there. Japan also did quite well on the Mac for the quarter, and the U.S. had a surprisingly strong quarter in the Mac with being up around -- Americas is up 25%. The U.S. was up just slightly higher than that. Our market share is obviously less outside the U.S. in most places than it is in the U.S., and so I think that speaks very, very well to the opportunity that the Mac has. We've now had 20 quarters in a row where we've outgrown the PC market and the momentum is still there. And we seem to be the only guys that are really focused on building innovative products in that space.",1
"Thank you very much. Could you talk a bit about the international penetration of Macs? Just perhaps, I don't know, Tim, comparing your adoption curve in the U.S. to where we are internationally, and if there's any difference in terms of the type of computers that your customers are purchasing internationally?",1
Shannon Cross with Cross Research.,1
"I was asked this question or a similar question when we launched the iPhone with Verizon. And what I've said then, and I still see it as being the case today, and I think you can see this in the products that have been shipped, is that the first generation of LTE chipsets force a lot of design compromises with the handset, and some of those, we are just not willing to make. And so we are extremely happy with the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3GS. And hitting 18.6 million units was something much larger than we thought we could do this quarter, and we're happy to have gotten it out to 3 more large carriers.",1
"And then also from the perspective of some positive feedback on LTE phones that are out from your competitors, how do you think about the maturity of those networks and Apple's sense of urgency to get products out for those faster networks? And what if any bottlenecks exist?",1
"Katy, it was very popular. It did very, very well.",1
"Yes, thank you. Just following on the iPhone discussion, what, if anything, did you learn about the price elasticity curve for the iPhone with the $49 3GS price point in the market this quarter?",1
"From Morgan Stanley, we'll go to Katy Huberty.",1
"Thanks, Rich.",1
"Okay. Alright. Well, thank you.",1
"No, I think I'll leave it at year-over-year. I would expect us to be up significantly.",1
"Total company gross margin was 47.4%, which was 540 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this difference was driven by lower-than-expected commodity and other costs; about 1/4 was due to stronger-than-expected revenue and product mix, including 35 million iPhones; and the remainder was due to some onetime items that we don't expect to recur in the June quarter.",1
Operating expenses were $3.2 billion and included $361 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $148 million.,1
"Turning to cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $110.2 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to $97.6 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of $12.6 billion. And about $74 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of the March quarter. Cash flow from operations was $14 billion.",1
"Apple has many distinct and unique advantages as the only company in the industry with world-class skills in hardware, software, and services. We have the strongest ecosystem in the industry with App Stores in 155 countries, iTunes music stores in 119 countries, hundreds of millions of iCloud users around the world, and most importantly, the highest loyalty and customer satisfaction rates in the business. And of course, we have a tremendous culture of innovation with a relentless focus on making the worldâs best products that change peopleâs lives. This is the same culture and company that brought the world the iPhone and the iPad, and weâve got a lot more surprises in the works.",1
"Our revenues grew about $13 billion in the first half of this fiscal year. Even though thatâs like adding the total first half revenue of five Fortune 500 companies, our average weekly growth slowed to 19% and our gross margins are closer to the levels of a few years ago. Our fiscal 2012 results were incredibly strong and thatâs making comparison very difficult this year. Last year, our business benefited from both high growth and demand for products and a corresponding growth in channel inventories along with a richer mix of higher gross margin products, a more favorable foreign currency environment, and historically low costs.",1
"These compares are made further challenging until we anniversary the launch of the iPad mini, which as you know, we strategically priced at a lower margin. As Peter will discuss, we are guiding to flat revenues year over year for the June quarter along with a slight sequential decline in gross margins.",1
"The decline in Appleâs stock price over the last couple of quarters has been very frustrating to all of us. But Apple remains very strong and we will continue to do what we do best. We canât control items such as exchange rates and world economies and even certain cost pressures, but the most important objective for Apple will always be creating innovative products and that is directly within our control.",1
"We will continue to focus on the long-term, and we remain very optimistic about our future. We are participating on large and growing markets. We see great opportunities in front of us, particularly given the long-term prospects of the smartphone and tablet market, the strength of our incredible ecosystem, which we plan to continue to augment with new services, our plans for expanded distribution, and the potential of exciting new product categories.",1
"Take the smartphone market for example, IDC estimates that this market will double between 2012 and 2016 to an incredible 1.4 billion units annually, and Gartner estimates that the tablet market is growing at an even faster rate from 125 million units in 2012 to a projected 375 million by 2016.",1
"Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware, software, and services that we canât wait to introduce this fall and throughout 2014. We continue to be very confident in our future product plans.",1
"A little over a year ago, we announced a plan to return $45 billion to shareholders over three years. Since we began paying dividends last August and began share buybacks last October, weâve already returned $10 billion under that program. We continue to generate cash in excess of our needs to operate the business, invest in our future, and maintain flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities.",1
"First, I would like to talk about our business and the road ahead. We are now half way through our fiscal 2013, and weâve accomplished a tremendous amount. Weâve introduced and ramped production of an unprecedented number of new products, and weâve set many new sales records. Our revenue for the first half was over $98 billion and our net income was over $22 billion. During that time, we sold 85 million iPhones and 42 million iPads. These are very, very large numbers, unimaginable even to us just a few years ago.",1
"We remain firmly committed to our objective of delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both our business performance and return of capital. So today, we are announcing an aggressive plan that more than doubles the size of the capital return program we announced last year to a total of $100 billion by the end of calendar year 2015. The vast majority of our incremental cash return will be in the form of share repurchases. As the Board and management team deliberated among the various alternatives to returning cash, we concluded that investing in Apple was the best.",1
"In addition to the share repurchases, we are increasing our current dividend by 15% to further appeal to investors seeking yield. And as part of our updated program, we will access the debt markets. Peter will provide more details about all of this in a moment.",1
"We appreciate the input that so many of our shareholders have provided us on how best to deploy our cash. We will review our cash allocation strategy each year, and we will continue to invest confidently in the business to bring great new products to market, strategically deploy capital in our supply chain, our retail stores and our infrastructure, and make acquisitions to expand our capabilities. We will be disciplined in what we do, but we will not underinvest.",1
Iâd now like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the details of the March quarter. Peter?,1
"Thank you, Tim. We are pleased to report the results of our second fiscal quarter. We established new March quarter records for iPhone and iPad sales and new all-time record for iTunes sales, leading to Appleâs strongest March quarter revenue ever.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $43.6 billion compared to $39.2 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of $4.4 billion or 11% and $600 million over the high end of our guidance range. The year-over-year revenue increase was fueled primarily by strong growth in iPad and iTunes sales as well as continued strong revenue from iPhone and Mac.",1
"Despite producing results that met or beat our guidance as we have done consistently, we know they didn't meet everyone's expectations, and though weâve achieved incredible scale and financial success, we acknowledge that our growth rate has slowed and our margins have decreased from the exceptionally high level we experienced in 2012.",1
"Thanks, Nancy. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us. We have a lot of news to share with you today about the details of our March quarter as well as a significant increase to our capital return program.",1
"As we indicated last month, subject to board declaration, we expect to announce a dividend of $2.65 [ph] per share when we report our third quarter results in July. And we will provide information on the record and payment dates at that time.",1
"Chris, let me sort of go in reverse order. We are incredibly confident in our business, our strategy and what we're doing. When we give you guidance, we give you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving. And finally, we do expect a sequential decline in iPhone sales driven by the fact that we built 2.6 million units of channel inventory in the March quarter, which we needed to do. We're now within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks, and we entered the March quarter with significant backlog, as we talked about, in January. And we're able to fulfill that and launch 20 countries in the month of January. So â- we have immense confidence in what we're doing and are very pleased with the way our business is performing.",1
"Sure, Kulbinder, the 2/3 that I talked about, the sequential decline, we see as being driven by a higher mix of iPads and Macs, a full quarter of selling the current lineup of the iPad or the current iPad lineup, and then a loss of leverage on the sequentially lower revenue. So those 3 factors we see driving 2/3 of the sequential decline.",1
"Okay, great. And then, Tim, just a question on the enterprise side. You mentioned a couple of times how the iPad is being taken into new markets, new verticals, whether it's because of the price point of the innovation. I'm just wondering specifically what resources is Apple dedicating to have a much more direct relationship with the enterprise? Can you speak on what's changed in the last 6 or 12 months and what you think you need to do to become a more credible or significant enterprise player?",1
"Initially, our focus was on working with the Fortune 500 and the Global 500 to get the iPad certified for their particular enterprise. And I'm pleased to report that 94% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPads and 75% of the Global 500 are testing or deploying the iPad. So these numbers are just off the charts for a product that's only 24 months old. And so we are moving our focus away from this and focusing on penetration within these accounts. Peter alluded to some of the wins that we have had in the -- his opening comments. The incredible things about these are that they span across many verticals, through government, through education, and many different functions within the enterprise. It's absolutely the most broad-based product I have ever seen in my whole career in terms of adoption rate into the enterprise. And so yes, this means that we're applying more resources in Fes [ph] and salespeople to interact directly with these customers. We also work with our carrier partners and our reseller partners in delivering both the products and services that are wrapped around that to these customers.",1
"Chris, are you there?",1
Hello? Can you hear me?,1
"Okay, sorry about that. If I take your revenue guidance and the comments you made around gross margin at face value, it seems to imply that you expect iPhone unit sales to be down about 10 million units quarter-on-quarter. First, is that in the right ballpark? And secondly, are you just being conservative with respect to the outlook? Or have you seen a change in the end demand environment for the phone?",1
"A follow-up, if I could, on iPad. It is supply constrained across many geos, as you talked about. Is there a specific component issue? Do you have visibility on resolution? When do you expect to be able to meet demand in the iPad?",1
I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim Cook for introductory remarks.,1
"It's hard to answer meet the demand. What I'm confident about, however, is that we will be able to supply a significant number of iPads during the quarter, and I feel very, very confident about that. It's tough to know precisely that it will balance until you get there, but I'm very confident with the improving supply and that the total number will be very significant.",1
"Thank you, Chris. A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks as a Podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on Apple.com/investor and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are (888) 203-1112 or (719) 457-0820. And please enter confirmation code 2646984. And these replays will be available beginning at approximately 5:30 p.m. Pacific Time today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at (408) 974-1896. And financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at (408) 974-4570, and I'm at (408) 974-5420. And thanks again for joining us.",1
"Please standby, we are about to begin. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to this Apple Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.",1
"Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today are Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and CFO, Peter Oppenheimer; and they'll be joined by Treasurer, Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with analysts.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenues, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, future products and capital allocation plans. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2012, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2013 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press releases. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Operating margin was $12.6 billion, representing 28.8% of revenue. Net income was $9.5 billion translating to diluted earnings per share of $10.09. As for the details of the quarter, Iâd like to begin with iPhone. We sold 37.4 million iPhones compared to 35.1 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of over 2.3 million or 7%. We ended the quarter with about 11.6 million total iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1 million iPhones and we ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory.",1
"Based on research published earlier this month by comScore, iPhones garnered the number one spot in the U.S. smartphone market for the three-month period ended in February with 39% share, up from 35% in the previous survey period. And in Japan, IDC Japan announced that iPhone gained the number one position for all of calendar year 2012 as well as for calendar Q4 2012 in both handsets and smartphones. This is also the first time a non-Japanese company has achieved the number one spot for an entire year.",1
"In addition, Apple was ranked number one in Nikkeiâs 2013 Japan Brand Survey, achieving the top spot for the second year in a row, which is unprecedented for a non-Japanese company. Around the world, based on its latest published estimates, IDC ranked iPhone number one or two in smarphone sales in over half the countries IDC tracks.",1
"As Tim discussed, we are pleased to announce that we are more than doubling our return of capital program to $100 billion by the end of calendar year 2015, which translates to an average of about $30 billion per year. We will continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases, and cash used to net-share-settle vesting RSUs. To facilitate our program, we will access the debt markets.",1
"Another tremendous success story is Supercell, founded in 2010. Based in Finland, Supercellâs Hey Day and Clash of Clans titles available only on iOS have been the top most in iPad games in over 60 countries helping the company generate $8.5 million in revenue per employee in 2012. And in the enterprise, iOS devices have a strong lead over Android. In its most recently published quarterly enterprise device activations report, Good Technologies found iOS devices accounted for 77% of all activations by its corporate customers.",1
"And thanks to careful App Store curation for the quality of apps, the iOS platform offers a much more secure environment. Recent research by McAfee Labs found that 97% of identified mobile malware was on the Android platform, with the remainder primarily on the Symbian and Java ME platforms. But perhaps the most important measure of the success of our ecosystem is how engaged our customers are with our products and services.",1
"In its most recently published update, Chitika found that iPad accounted for 82% of all North American Tablet Web Traffic in March. Interest in apps remained very strong in the March quarter with over 800 apps downloaded per second and year-over-year iOS app revenues more than doubling in the quarter. And since launching iCloud just 18 months ago, we now have 300 million people using it every day. We will continue to invest in the ecosystem and have some great new features and capabilities in the pipeline.",1
"Iâd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. Revenue for the quarter was $5.2 billion compared to $4.4 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 19%. This growth was fueled primarily by strong sales of iPhone and iPad. We ended the quarter with a total of 402 stores, including a 151 outside the United States. We expect to open about 30 new stores in total in fiscal 2013 and to complete at least 20 store remodels. With an average of 401 stores open in the March quarter, average revenue per store was $13.1 million, compared to $12.2 million in the year ago quarter. Retail segment income was $1.1 billion.",1
"We hosted 91 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to 85 million in the year-ago quarter. That translates the 17,500 visitors per store per week. Total company gross margin was 37.5%, which was at the low end of our guidance range of 37.5% to 38.5%. Operating expenses were $3.8 billion and included $488 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&E was $347 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26%",1
"And turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with $144.7 billion in cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities compared to $137.1 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of $7.6 billion. Over $102 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the March quarter, and cash flow from operations was $12.5 billion. We paid $2.5 billion in dividends in the March quarter, and earlier this month, we concluded the $1.95 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in the December quarter, resulting in cumulative retirement of over 4 million shares of Apple stock.",1
"Let me provide more details regarding the three key elements of our plan. First, our Board has increased the share buyback authorization to $60 billion from the original $10 billion announced last year, thatâs a $50 billion increase. This is the largest share buyback authorization of any company in history. We are very confident in Appleâs future and believe so strongly that repurchasing our shares represents an attractive use of our capital that we have dedicated a vast majority of the increase in our capital return program to share repurchases. We will buy shares under this authorization beginning this month. We will also continue to net-share-settle employee RSUs as they vest, and expect to use about $1 billion of cash annually to do this.",1
"A recent study by Kantar measured 95% loyalty rate among iPhone owners, substantially higher than the competition, and iPhone remains top in customer experience. Last month, we were very pleased to receive the number one ranking in smartphone customer satisfaction from J.D. Power and Associates for the ninth consecutive time.",1
"Second, we are increasing our quarterly dividend from $2.65 to $3.05 per share, a 15% increase. We plan to review our quarterly dividend payment annually. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share payable on May 16, 2013, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 13, 2013. We are very proud that Apple is among the largest dividend payers in the world with annual payments of about $11 billion.",1
"Third, we will access the U.S. debt markets over time and have recently secured credit ratings from S&P and Moodyâs. We are continuing to generate significant cash offshore and repatriating this cash would result in significant tax consequences under current U.S. tax law.",1
"Incorporating debt into our capital structure will provide several benefits including access to attractively priced capital, a reduction in our overall cost of capital and an efficient leverage of our very strong balance sheet. We expect to fund the capital return program from existing domestic cash, future cash generated in the U.S., and from borrowing in the U.S. We will maintain sufficient domestic liquidity to grow the business and execute capital expenditures and acquisitions. The program announced today will result in returning an average of $30 billion annually to shareholders.",1
"To put this in perspective, the $30 billion would have represented substantially all of our fiscal year 2012 fully tax free cash flow had we repatriated our foreign earnings. Between now and the end of calendar year 2015, we would expect both our foreign cash and our domestic borrowing to grow. We will continue to review each element of our capital return program on an annual basis.",1
"In conclusion, our capital return program is designed to facilitate our objective of delivering attractive returns to our shareholders on an efficient basis, while maintaining the flexibility to invest in the incredible opportunities that we continue to see for our business.",1
"Now, as we move ahead into the June quarter, Iâd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $33.5 billion and $35.5 billion compared to $35 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 36% and 37% reflecting approximately $90 billion related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $3.85 billion and $3.95 billion including about $500 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%.",1
"Developer such as Backflip Studios have seen explosive growth in their business, thanks to the success of their apps on the iOS platform. With 70 people, this company maintains a growing suite of titles that has seen over 275 million downloads equating to nearly 5 million daily active users and 34 million monthly active users. With annual App Store sales approaching $100 million, Backflipâs iOS sales comprised approximately 95% of the companyâs revenues in 2012.",1
"Cumulative app downloads have surpassed 45 billion and app developers have made over $9 billion for their sales through the App Store, including $4.5 billion in the most recent four quarters alone. Canalys estimate the sales from our App Store accounted for 74% of all app sales worldwide in the March quarter. We believe this is in large part due to the great development environment, broad distribution, large and active user base, and seamless integration that the iOS platform offers.",1
"The strong iTunes sales in addition to other service revenue helped us achieve for the first time more than $4 billion in combined quarterly revenue from iTunes, software, and services. We are thrilled with the growth of these revenue streams. Today, we have music stores in 119 countries offering a combined catalog of 35 million songs. We sell movies in 109 countries offering 60,000 titles, and we have iBookstores in 155 countries offering 1.75 million iBooks for sale, and with App Stores in 155 countries that encompass almost 90% of the worldâs population, our developers have created more than 850,000 iOS apps, including 350,000 apps made for iPad.",1
"Today, our iTunes store offer the broadest combination of geographic reach in content depth in the industry, and they surpassed quarterly billings of $4 billion for the first time ever in the March quarter, thatâs a $16 billion annual run rate making our digital content stores the largest in the world. The quarterâs iTunes billings translated to record quarterly iTunes revenue of $2.4 billion, up 28% from the year ago March quarter with new quarterly revenue records for music, movies, and apps.",1
"The Apple ecosystem continues to grow and thrive and we believe itâs a very important driver of our incredibly strong customer satisfaction and retention, as well as developer interest and success. This Sunday marks the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the iTunes Music Store, which revolutionized the distribution of digital content.",1
"Moving to iPod, we sold 5.6 million iPods compared to 7.7 million in the year ago quarter. iPod Touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold during the March quarter. iPodâs share of U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the March quarter based on the latest data published by NPD, and iPod continues to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK.",1
"Turning to Mac, we sold just under 4 million Macs, which is a 2% decline from the year-ago quarter. IDC estimates that the global personal computer market contracted by 14% during the March quarter. We experienced strong year-over-year growth in desktop sales following the December quarter launch of our stunning new iMacs, offset by a decline in portable sales given a weaker personal computer market overall. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range in Mac channel inventory.",1
"First National Bank, the oldest bank in South Africa has issued iPads to wealth managers to help enhance customer relationships and interactions. And in the education market, Grupo Santillana has developed UNO Internacional and integrated educational system that uses iPads to create digital learning environment in more than 700 private K-12 schools in Latin America. UNO Internacionalhas deployed more than 60,000 iPads to schools in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil including 17,000 iPads for teachers and students in Brazil in the March quarter alone.",1
We are delighted by the number of companies that are choosing iPad for their most important business tasks as well as the rapid adoption of iPad in emerging countries around the world. Doctors at the Columbia Cardiovascular Foundation in South America are using an in-house app to perform remote diagnostics for patients in inaccessible parts of the country.,1
"The most recent survey published by ChangeWave indicated a 96% satisfaction rate among iPad customers. Not only is iPad a huge hit among consumers, but it also continues to be widely adopted by business customers as well. iPad and the iOS ecosystem are driving innovation across industries and in companies large and small.",1
"We ended the quarter with about 4.8 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.4 million. All of the sequential increase was attributable to iPad mini. As we discussed previously, we were not able to meet demand for iPad mini in the December quarter and entered the March quarter below our target range of channel inventory. This sequential increase places us within our target range of four to six weeks of total iPad channel inventory.",1
"We were able to sell significantly more iPad minis in the March quarter than in the December launch quarter and to expand availability to China. Customers love the combination of experience, performance, and size that iPad mini offers, and our early market research indicates that the overwhelming majority of iPad mini purchasers are first-time iPad customers.",1
"iPad experienced very strong year-over-year growth in every operating segment, particularly in Greater China and Japan where sales more than doubled year over year. Both iPad and iPad mini continue to be extremely popular, and we were pleased with sales of both.",1
"Turning to iPad, we were thrilled to sell 19.5 million iPads during the quarter compared to 11.8 million in the year ago quarter, thatâs an increase of 7.7 million units or 65%.",1
"GlaxoSmithKline has developed more than 50 in-house iOS apps to support the thousands of iPhones and iPads connecting to its corporate network. Other companies such as AXA, Nordstromâs, Eaton Corporation, and Takeda Pharmaceuticals are supporting thousands of iPhones, and are continually adding new in-house apps to better serve customers and help employees work more efficiently.",1
Ciscoâs Bring Your Own Device program across 80 countries has resulted in a 50% increase in the number of iPhones connecting to its corporate network in the past year.,1
"Businesses around the world continue to scale iPhone across their workforces. Globally, nearly 30,000 companies are developing and distributing iOS apps for corporate use by their employees.",1
"Just a clarification, Pete. Did you say that 2/3 of the sequential gross margin decline was basically due to products? And did I hear that right? Can you clarify that? Because it seems like quite a rapid drop, and I'm just wondering how much conservatism is in your gross margin guidance. And then I have a follow-up for Tim afterwards.",1
And we'll go to Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.,1
"Scott, in terms of component costs for the quarter we just finished, Q2 component costs were better than we had planned, and this assisted us in exceeding our gross margin guidance, as Peter talked about earlier. Displays and NAND flash drove the majority of the favorable commodity cost benefit. In terms of the June quarter and the -- what we factored into our guidance, NAND and mobile DRAM supply continued to exceed demand. And because of that, we expect pricing will continue to be favorable. For most LCDs, we expect pricing to stabilize as the market moves to a supply-demand balance. The hard drive market has moved to a supply-demand balance, and we expect marketing -- market pricing to decline but will still be higher than the pre-flood level from the tragedy in Thailand. Most other components are expected to fall in line with or somewhat faster than historical trends.",1
"Tim, there's been quite a bit of concern both in the press and within the investment community around carrier subsidies. And I think the concerns are generally twofold: First, that carriers will attempt to stretch out the replacement cycle. And second, that over time, carriers across the globe will attempt to reduce subsidies significantly. I mean, how do you think about this risk? And do you think there are factors that could pressure subsidies going forward? And how would that impact Apple?",1
We'll go to -- [indiscernible] we'll go to Tony Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.,1
"I was wondering if you could talk more broadly just about what you might be learning about lower priced -- price points on both the iPhone and iPad. I know it was asked earlier. But was the decrease in iPad price exclusively mix related? Or are there -- or is it a further broadening of your channel to indirect partners? But more broadly, Tim, maybe you could talk about elasticity, what you're learning about customer preferences for lower-priced offerings on both the iPhone and iPad. And I do have a follow-up, please.",1
"Sure. Tony, on iPad 2, we're -- with the change in the entry price to $399, we're actually thrilled with the results that we've seen, although, as Peter said, it's only been a few weeks. And so it's too early to make a -- come to a clear conclusion. But from what we are seeing, this unlocks some education demand that is probably a more price-sensitive customer. Also, in several other countries, there was a marked change in demand at that price point. And so on the early going, we feel great about it. But I'd also point out that the new iPad is -- was current -- was supply constrained last quarter for the full 3 weeks or so it was shipping and is actually still constrained. And so the mix of the new iPad to the iPad 2, we're not certain of what that is yet. But we are certain, with what we've seen so far, that the absolute sales of iPad 2, at least in the early going, is very exciting. On the iPhone, we continue to be very happy with the moves that we made in pricing just a few months ago on the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4. And both of them contributed to our ability to achieve 35 million in sales, which is our second highest quarter of all time.",1
"The -- as a second question, I was wondering if you can talk about how you think about the markets for tablet and PC devices going forward. I think you've been fairly clear about saying that you believe that tablets will eclipse PCs in volume at some point. And I think you've also said they're somewhat discrete markets. There seems to be a lot of work, particularly on PC-based platforms, towards trying to combine the PC and tablet experience going forward in part because Windows 8 will be able to -- is a touch-based operating system as well. Can you comment about why you don't believe the PC or the Ultrabook and tablet markets or your MacBook Air and tablet markets won't converge? Isn't it realistic to think in a couple of years we're going to have a device that's under 2 pounds with great battery life that we can all carry around and open as a notebook or close up in a clever way and use as a tablet? Can you comment on why you don't think that product might not come or why you believe these markets are separate?",1
"I think, Tony, anything can be forced to converge. But the problem is that products are about trade-offs, and you begin to make trade-offs to the point where what you have left at the end of the day doesn't please anyone. You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user. And so our view is that the tablet market is huge. And we've said that since day one. We didn't wait until we had a lot of results. We were using them here, and it was already clear to us that there was so much you could do and that the reasons that people would use those would be so broad. And that's precisely what we've seen. We -- the iPad has taken off not only in consumer in a meaningful way but in education and in enterprise, and it's sort of everywhere you look now. And the applications are so easy to make very meaningful for someone, and there -- the -- there's such an abundance of those that -- and as the ecosystem gets better and better and as we continue to double down on making great products, I think that the limit here is nowhere in sight. We've now -- through the last quarter, I should say, which is just 2 years after we shipped the initial iPad, weâve sold 67 million. And to put that in some context, it took us 24 years to sell that many Macs and 5 years for that many iPods and over 3 years for that many iPhones. And we were extremely happy with the trajectory on all of those products. And so I think iPad, it's a profound product. It -- the breadth of it is incredible, and the appeal of it is universal. And so I am -- I could not be happier with being in the market, and the level at which we're innovating in both the product and the ecosystem here is incredible. Now in terms of the market itself, IDC and Gartner and Forrester had some numbers out there. I think Gartner is saying there's somewhere around 375 or so by 2015. Forrester is 375, somewhere around there. And so basically, the -- they're in the mid-300s, which is about where the PC market is today. And 2015 is only 3 years from now. And so I think even the more formal predictors outside of us are beginning to see these lines cross. And so I strongly believe that they will. Now having said that, I also believe that there is a very good market for the MacBook Air, and we continue to innovate in that product. And -- but I do think that it appeals to somewhat -- someone that has a little bit different requirements. And you wouldn't want to put these things together because you wind up compromising in both and not pleasing either user. Some people will prefer to own both, and that's great, too. But I think to make the compromises of convergence, so -- we're not going to that party. Others might. Others might from a defensive point of view, particularly. But we're going to play in both.",1
We'll go to Bill Shope at Goldman Sachs.,1
"Well, Bill, our focus is on making the very best smartphone in the world. And a phone that delivers a -- just an off-the-charts user experience that customers want to use every day of their lives. And at the end of the day, I think that carriers, the vast majority of carriers, or maybe even all carriers, want to provide what their customers want to buy. And that's what they're motivated for. And so the most important thing by far is for Apple to continue making great products that customers want. And we are deeply committed to doing this and are innovating at a rate and pace that's unbelievable in this area. For -- from a carrier's perspective, I think it's important to remember that the subsidy is not large relative to the sum of the monthly payments across a 24-month contract period. And any delta between iPhone and maybe another phone is a -- an even smaller level of difference. And the iPhone has some distinct advantages for the carrier over competing smartphones. For example, many of the carrier executives have told me that churn from iPhone customers is the lowest of any phone they sell in their whole -- in all of the phones they carry. And that has a significant direct financial benefit to the carrier. Also, our engineering teams work extremely hard to be efficient with data and differently than some others. And we believe that as a result of this, that iPhone has far better data efficiency compared to other smartphones that are using sort of an app-rich ecosystem. Finally, we think that the -- and this is the most important, is that iPhone is the best smartphone on the planet to entice a customer who is currently using a traditional mobile phone to upgrade to a smartphone. This is by far the largest opportunity for Apple, for our carrier partners and is a great, fantastic experience to the customer. And so there's a win-win-win there. And so I think all of these factors are -- some of these factors are missed in this general discussion of subsidy.",1
"Gene, it's Peter. We're actually thrilled with the rate that we're adding content into iTunes. This is something that we have to do country by country, so it takes a bit of time to put in place. We have the largest catalog of songs and movies available anywhere, over 28 million songs. And this led to almost $1.9 billion of revenue in the March quarter, which was up 35% year-over-year. So we're thrilled with the progress that we're making in iTunes and customers love it.",1
"That's helpful. I had one other follow-up question, if I could. I appreciate the user stats you gave us on iCloud. But can you give us any color, now it's been out for a few months, on how consumers are actually using iCloud? And in particular, are you seeing a big uptake in iTunes Match and paid storage additions? And how should we think about that?",1
"Bill, it's Peter. Customers are using all the features of iCloud. Response has been terrific. Feedback has been terrific. Pickup on storage is occurring, but it's growing because we've just launched iCloud in October. And we've now got over 125 million users that have come on to the service since then and they're building up documents in music and other things that they want to store. And so I think storage growth will come more over time. Our real desire here was not about selling more storage. We think Match is a great product, and we recommend that everybody use it. But it's a paid for service. We just really wanted to increase the customer delight from the entire ecosystem and platform of our iOS devices and the Mac, and that's why we've done iCloud. And we just -- we couldn't be happier that just a couple months into this, there's more than 125 million users around the world on iCloud.",1
"If you could dig a little bit more into what's going on in China. I know you gave some high-level numbers. But is this increased distribution points, is it just price elasticity of lower-priced 3GS? Is it more people in China having money? All of the above? Anything that you can tell us to explain this vertical growth?",1
"Gene, it was an incredible quarter in China. We -- the revenue was record -- was a record at $7.9 billion in Greater China, which is up over 3x year-over-year and brings the first half revenue for Greater China to $12.4 billion. That compares to a full year last year of $13.3 billion. So it is mind-boggling that we can do this well. A part of this was the pent-up demand for iPhone 4S. As you know, we launched mainland China in January of this year, and so China was not able to get into the Q1 period. So all of that is in Q2. We also have very strong demand for iPad 2. We have not shipped in mainland China yet the new iPad, although we are shipping in Hong Kong. And so it's a combination of these things. And the halo that both of these products have produced for the Mac is also incredible. Mac was up over 60% year-over-year. And that compares to a market rate of growth of about 6%. We have expanded point of sales. On a year-over-year basis, Mac is up 70% but still only 1,800 for all of Greater China. And so there's obviously a lot more opportunity there. iPhone, we're up over 11,000, which is 138%. But 11,000 is a much smaller number than we have in the U.S., and obviously, China will, in the next few years, be a bigger opportunity. iPad is only in 2,500 points of sale. And so yes, we've expanded. We've expanded a lot. However, there's a lot of headroom here in our view.",1
Was the iPhone mix in China different than the rest of the world? Or how was it different?,1
"I don't have that in front of me, but my recollection is that it wasnât materially different. But keep in mind that iPhone 4S just launched in -- within the quarter. And so usually, when a new product launches within the quarter, you would expect it to mix fairly much toward the new product.",1
"Yes, Rich, it's Tim. As you said, we did outgrow the market. Macs grew at about 7% where the market grew about 2%. And so this is the 24th straight quarter that we've outgrown the market, and so we're extremely pleased with that. The compare to last year is largely affected by the fact that we changed the bulk of our portable line, or the MacBook Pros, in the February time frame of 2011. And so it's a very tough compare. Specifically, the portables last year were up 53% year-on-year. And obviously, that -- so that compare was very difficult. If you look at it sequentially, you also have to factor in that we had 14 weeks in the December quarter. And so the 26% year-over-year growth in December quarter is probably more like 17% when you factor out that 14th week. And so yes, I think there was some cannibalization from iPad and the market is slow. But the much, much larger factor and in fact, in -- it might be the vast majority of the difference is the compare to a year ago.",1
I recognize that you outgrew the market in Macs yet again. But I did want to get your views on the slowdown in year-over-year growth rate within the category and what factors you would attribute that to. Are we -- is it product transition related? Were the inventories down quarter-over-quarter? iPad cannibalization? Any other color that you can provide would be helpful.,1
"Look, Katy, we're just learning about be the elasticity of demand and the $399 price point. It's doing well. But I have to tell you, the new iPad is on fire, and we're selling them as fast as we can make them. So we'll learn more over this quarter especially as we get through the education buying season, which looks terrific for us especially on the iPad.",1
"Just as a quick follow-up to number 4, the decrease in iPad price. You already saw a 7% sequential decline in March, which suggests that the uptake of the lower-priced iPad 2 was pretty phenomenal in March. Is that the right way to read it? And what does that demand tell you about the potential to move to lower price points on the iPad over time and see significant incremental demand?",1
"We -- look, we've just reported the most amazing March quarter Apple has ever had. We feel very, very good about our business and our new product pipeline.",1
"And finally, the last factor to point out, the U.S. dollar has strengthened recently, and we expect this to have an impact on the sequential compare, especially versus last year when the dollar weakened against most currencies over the comparable time periods.",1
"Fourth, we decreased the entry price of the entry iPad to $399.",1
"The third factor: our new iPad execution was also fabulous. We had an incredible start with the new iPad. We launched with significant supply, leading to sales of 3 million units in the first couple of days, which was the -- and also the fastest country rollout ever. We therefore were able to satisfy much more of the demand for the new iPad in the March quarter this year compared to the iPad 2 in the March quarter of last year. This resulted in a shift of iPad volume into March this year versus last, and it will also affect the sequential compares this year to the last.",1
"The second factor: fabulous iPhone 4S execution. As we told you in January, we exited December with significant iPhone 4S backlog, which led to a huge January. We launched China and 20 other countries also in January, which completed the rollout of the iPhone 4S into all the countries where iPhone is currently shipping. And as I said before, we exited the quarter within a supply and demand balance.",1
"The first, the iPhone channel inventory changes. As I discussed in my prepared remarks, we increased our iPhone channel inventory by about 2.6 million units in the March quarter this year, and we exited within our target inventory range of about 4 to 6 weeks. Last year, we continued to add new countries into the June quarter, and we built an additional 700,000 units of iPhone channel inventory last year in the June quarter. So the combination of these channel builds in the March quarter of this year and the June quarter of last year will impact the sequential comparisons from this year to last.",1
"Sure, Katy. It's Peter. The manufacturing ramps for the iPhone 4S and the new iPad were extremely successful for us. They yielded the highest launch supply and the fastest country rollouts for these product families that we've ever had. As a result, we were able to fulfill demand in the March quarter rather than the June quarter this year, and that generated revenue of over $39 billion. Therefore, unlike last year, we expect a sequential decline in revenue this year. I'd highlight 5 primary factors that have influenced our thinking:",1
"As it relates to the June quarter revenue guidance, it implies a sequential downtick that is worse than the guidance message you provided over the last 3 years. So can you just talk about some of the headwinds sequentially you see on the top line in the June quarter relative to March?",1
[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.,1
"Thank you, Peter. [Operator Instructions] Operator, may we have the first question?",1
"We remain very confident in our strategy, and we're very excited about the fabulous new products in our pipeline. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.",1
"In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record March quarter performance with earnings nearly doubling year-over-year. The new iPad is off to a tremendous start and is our fastest iPad rollout ever. We're thrilled with the global success of the iPhone 4S, which is now available in more than 100 countries, including China.",1
"As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $34 billion compared to $28.6 billion in the June quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 41.5%, reflecting approximately $70 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.3 billion, including about $385 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $175 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 25.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $8.68.",1
"And just one final quick question on iTunes content. It seems that there's kind of this logjam to getting more TV shows and movies and the rentals, and it's been a little bit of a slow pace of improvement. How important is getting better content on iTunes? And what's going to break that logjam?",1
And that will come from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.,1
"Yes, Scott, it's Peter. We are, as I discussed in Shannon's question, investing in R&D to introduce the most innovative products in the market. We are also spending on marketing, advertising, opening more of our own retail stores and expanding our indirect channels around the world to increase sales. And we're investing in infrastructure to support our growth and also stock-based comp for our employees. We are very confident in the investments that we're making. We're thinking about the long term, and we're confident in the returns that we're going to get in -- on these investments.",1
"Well, we view this as a good thing. We are investing in engineering to continue to bring out the most innovative products in the world to delight customers. We are making investments in our hardware and software engineering teams. We're shipping the best products that Apple has ever shipped today. And we've got some fabulous new products in the pipeline. So I'm very confident in the return that we're going to see on these investments.",1
"Okay, great. Sorry about that. So just in terms of the -- your flexibility or versatility, you've been flexible here recently in terms of your cash usage as well as just providing more color or commentary during your earnings call. I was just wondering how we should think about opportunities for incremental flexibility as it relates to patent disputes. Is there a point where Apple maybe feels it reasonable to settle and just continue out-innovating and outgunning the competition rather than wage an ongoing litigation? Are there opportunities for that?",1
"I've always hated litigation, and I continue to hate it. We just want people to invent their own stuff. And so if we could get to some kind of arrangement where we could be assured that's the case and a fair settlement on the stuff that's occurred, I would highly prefer to settle versus battle. But it -- the key thing is that it's very important that Apple not become the developer for the world. We need people to invent their own stuff.",1
"Next, we'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research Group.",1
"My first question is just going back to iCloud. Perhaps Tim, if you can talk a little bit more about feedback from customers? Curious sort of average number of devices of customers that customers are putting up or maybe percent of users attaching more than one device. Just sort of what's the initial feedback? And then I have a follow-up.",1
"Shannon, it's Peter. I don't want to frustrate you, but, well, we have, of course, the data that you're asking for, but we don't want to help our competitors. And so it's not something that we're going to provide probably. The feedback that we're getting from customers on iCloud is just it's off the charts. They're loving it. And the fact that we could be here on the conference call with you in April just 5 or 6 months after introducing the service and have 125 million people around the world using it every day, I think, speaks for itself.",1
"Okay. And then my follow-up question is just on R&D. I mean, it was up 45%. It's over $800 million now. I'm curious. So was a chunk of the growth from the acquisitions you've made? Or is there anything you can tell us in terms of your thoughts on R&D and investment levels? Because it's definitely been ramping, which, I guess, bodes for good products coming for -- in the future.",1
"You used to give sort of an idea of percentage to software, percentage of hardware. Is there anything you can give there?",1
"Tim, the other big issue outside of the subsidy question that you just answered a couple of calls ago was regarding shortages. There's talk about potential Qualcomm shortages into the next couple of quarters and potential constraints even at year end for some pretty neat products that might be good for you to have in some products down the road. I know you don't comment on future products, but this is a big concern. And I guess can you just talk directionally about whether you expect long term to get your -- more than your fair share of product and what you need? And do you see any bottlenecks on the horizon that are major in that department or in any component down the line over the long term?",1
"Shannon, I'm sorry. I don't have that in front of me.",1
"From Sterne Agee, we'll go to Shaw Wu.",1
"Shaw Wu - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division",1
Just a quick clarification. I understand you disclosed China in terms of the 4S shipping along with 21 countries early in January. What about China Telecom specifically? When did that launch?,1
"Shaw, it's Tim. We launched with China Telecom in March. And in early part of March, we were at a supply-demand balance with them prior to the end of the quarter. We're very happy to be working with them.",1
"Peter, on the OpEx side, that's an area where you guys have been getting a fair amount of leverage. If you look year-over-year, it's down pretty significantly as a percentage of sales. So I'm just curious on your thoughts going forward, maybe not just next quarter but sort of how do you think about the OpEx leverage longer term? And then, Tim, can you just kind of take us through the components like you do on most quarter calls and where you're seeing some pricing better than expected and maybe worse than expected and put that in the context of going forward as well?",1
"Yes, I can now.",1
"Yes. Tim, Tim, can you hear me?",1
"And Mark, did you have a second question?",1
"Sure. iPhone, well, we would expect to have a year-over-year increase and a sequential decrease for the reasons that both Tim and I discussed. We built channel inventory in the March quarter, and we are exiting March in supply and demand balance. And we had a huge January. And for iPad, we would have a significant -- expect to have a significant year-over-year and sequential increase in sales. And I've got a -- I want to put something out just so it gets out on the call in case it's not asked and talk a little bit about the gross margin guidance that we provided for the June quarter. We're pleased to be providing a gross margin guidance of 41.5% for the quarter. We expect about 2/3 of the sequential decline to be primarily driven by a higher mix of iPads and Macs, a full quarter of selling the current iPad lineup and lots of leverage on the sequentially lower revenue. And we would expect the remainder of the difference to be primarily driven by the items benefiting the March quarter gross margin that we don't expect to recur in June.",1
"Oh, sorry. Go ahead.",1
"Go ahead, Tim.",1
"A question for Peter. Peter, can you provide a little more framework or context for us in terms of understanding how the segments dovetail with the 13% sequential revenue decline in the guidance? In terms of that bogey, what product segments could be higher in terms of decline or less than the decline?",1
"Yes. Keith, Spain has been weak for us and probably more broadly for many companies. We -- our revenues grew in Spain last quarter but materially less than we grew in Europe or worldwide. However, that wasn't cause and effect related to the issue you're on, that Spain is just in a, I think, terrible economic situation. And so I sort of look at that as an unusual case. To be clear about what was done, is that -- I think there's also some noise in the pike on this one. What the carriers did was they still have subsidies for their existing customers. And I don't want to talk about what the -- their existing customer-to-new customer ratio is, but you can find out numbers from different parts of the world and model that. They pulled subsidies on new customers. And so it wasn't a pull of all subsidies, it was a pull of subsidies from new. And it -- all carriers in that market did not do that. A couple of the carriers did. So I wouldn't necessarily use that as a proxy for the world, I guess, is my point.",1
"It certainly seems so. Tim, for my follow-up from Bill Shope's question, there have been some changes in Spain in particular on the behavior of their carriers and the economics. And Vodafone has actually changed some of their subsidy levels. It's only been about 30 days or 35 days, but have you seen any changes in demand levels in the Spanish market as a consequence of some of the activities of the carriers? And that's it for me.",1
"No. China is not supply-demand imbalanced on iPhone. On iPad, worldwide, we're supply constrained on the new iPad, both coming out of last quarter. And to give you a current view, we're still supply constrained on the new iPad. Demand has been incredibly robust, and we are selling them as fast as we can make them, as Peter mentioned earlier. In China, I believe on a macro basis, China has an enormous number of people moving into the higher income groups, middle class, if you will. And this is creating a demand for goods, not just Apple's but other companies' goods as well. And so I think there's a tremendous opportunity for companies that understand China, and we're doing everything we can to understand it and serve the market as good as we can.",1
On China specifically. It sounds like China can still be a help. Or it sounds like China is still supply-demand imbalanced. But I wanted to see if you could add some thoughts [ph] there in terms of iPhones.,1
"Yes, let me start with the -- your last question. On the 2.6 million, our desire, just to be very clear on this, our desire was to increase inventory -- channel inventory across the quarter. As you might recall, we ended with only 6 million units in the channel coming out of December because we were extremely backlogged. And this is on particularly -- this is on 4S specifically. Our target is to be between 4 million and 6 million. The addition of the 2.6 million allowed us to get within that range by the end of the quarter. And so we feel that we exited the quarter as supply and demand balanced. Because our execution, the ops team was so good, the vast majority of the supply-demand in the different countries was reached by the end of January. And so we had the mother of all Januarys with the -- with really getting out of the vast majority of the iPhone 4S backlog and launching China as well. And so it was an incredible, incredible start of the quarter for us. Your other question was?",1
"Tim, for you, I think. Could you add some more specifics on iPhones in Asia Pacific, including China? Is supply-demand in balance there? Or that -- can that be a help? And then more broadly, with iPhones getting increased inventory of 2.6 million units, will that be a -- will that, in fact, go down in the June quarter? Is there any comments, you could provide there? And then I have a follow-up, please.",1
That will come from Keith Bachman with Bank of MontrÃ©al.,1
"There's no plan to be in 10,000. And so we're trying some things. And as you know, that doesn't include the Mac. And so we're trying some things and seeing how it goes. And they've been a very good partner for us on iPod and have been selling iPods for a while and are an increasingly more substantial partner in the iPad space as well and an evolving partner on iPhone. And so we're working with them and enjoy working with them and hope to continue expanding.",1
"Okay. Well, I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is regarding Walmart. They were actually just in our building in a conference here talking about how they're moving from one store in Arkansas now to 25 stores. And they seem really pleased with the ""store within a store"" concept. How is it going? And when can you be in all 10,000 stores?",1
"Tough question to answer, Ben. Obviously, we're aware of the lithography transition issue that you mentioned with 28 nanometer. We currently do not use 28-nanometer parts. But as you also know, we don't comment about future products, and so I can't talk about the future part. Generally, outside of this, we work very closely with our supplier partners and do everything that we can do to get supply. And sometimes, we're successful with that, and sometimes we're not. And so you can bet that we are focused on anything that we think may impact us and trying to push every button within our disposal to work on it.",1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2010, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective date.",1
"Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Apple Inc. Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would now turn the call over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.",1
"Okay, Iâll cede the floor. Thank you.",1
"Okay, thatâs helpful. Thanks. And then, could you guys provide the direct/indirect sales mix for the quarter and did it have an effect on gross margins for the quarters and does it have any bearing on your guidance here for the third quarter? Thanks.",1
"All right, great. Well, Iâll be there in June and look forward to hearing from you. Thanks.",1
"Thank you, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?",1
That will come from Bill Fearnley with FTN Equity Capital.,1
"Yes, thanks, good afternoon. Could I ask a question here on the App Store? Is there any additional color you can give even directionally on the mix between paid and free downloads on the App Store overall, any additional color between the iPhone and the iPod Touch, and then I had a quick follow-up, if I could?",1
"Iâm sorry. We donât disclose the free versus the paid, but we are just hours away from our billionth download and couldnât be happier with the Storeâs results.",1
"Bill, this is Tim. I would add to that a couple of things. One, one of the keys behind the growth of the iPod this quarter despite the economic environment was that the iPod Touch more than doubled year-over-year. So, it was a tremendous result and as Peter mentioned earlier in his remarks, the sum of iPhone plus iPod Touch is now about 37 million units and so, it provides an enormous platform for developers to develop on and with the â with our recent SDK changes the developers are working on now, I think it just unleashes a whole new level of innovation that keeps Apple years ahead of everyone else.",1
"Bill, the direct percent in the March quarter was 48%. It really didnât have a bearing on gross margin that was reasonably close to what we thought. Now, as we enter the June quarter, the education buying season begins and that is one of the reasons why I expect gross margin to be down sequentially along with the impact of the U.S. dollar and the commodity and component environment.",1
"And then of course, if we find a way where we can deliver an innovative product that really makes a contribution, then we will do that and we have some interesting ideas in the space. The product pipeline is fantastic for the Mac. We are â as we look back over the last four plus years, 17 of the 18 quarters of the last four-and-a-half years, weâve exceeded the market rate of growth.",1
"Thanks, guys. Congrats on a good quarter.",1
"Thanks Bill. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"From Credit Suisse, we'll hear from Bill Shope",1
"Okay thanks guys. Given your gross margin performance over the past several quarters as well as the guidance, how should we think about the long-term 30% gross margin target that youâve mentioned in the past. It seems that just looking at the product mix, particularly on a GAAP basis is mathematically very difficult to get there without some fairly drastic changes to the business model. How do you guys think about that longer-term?",1
"Well I have given you our guidance for the June quarter at about 33%. For the September quarter, I think our gross margins would be about 30%. We â Iâm not going to make comments on fiscal â10. I think the important part is as you look forward, itâs just to understand that we are very, very focused on delivering extraordinary products to our customers and weâre going to provide them ever increasing value and we just donât want you to count on the gross margins that youâve recently seen which have benefited from just a tremendous commodity and component environment.",1
"Okay. And then you sort of mentioned this when you talked about consumer versus professional and education, but would you say that youâre seeing any signs of stabilization in the consumer market that some of the other tech companies decided in recent weeks and with that in mind, can you comment on the linearity of the quarter and what you sort of saw on a trend line basis as you progressed through the quarter.",1
"And to exceed in this horrendous economy, I think is quite an accomplishment, especially when you look at the â that these very low-priced netbooks that are â I think itâs a stretch to call it a personal computer, are really propping up the unit numbers from the industry as a whole. So, we feel great about our performance. Itâs a very solid performance, especially in this environment and the pipeline looks fantastic.",1
"That said, we do look at the space and are interested to see our customersâ respond to it. People that want a small computer so to speak that does browsing and e-mail, might want to buy an iPod Touch or they might want to buy an iPhone. And so, we have other products to accomplish some of what people are buying netbooks for and so, in that particular way we play in an indirect basis.",1
"Keith, no, there is nothing with what iPhone or deferred revenue or cost from a policy change that played into that. I was actually very pleased with the cash generation in the quarter, was up over $700 million from the end of the December quarter. But there are three things to discuss with you that did play into the cash generation in the quarter.",1
"Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about the Mac business? It seems that desktop side exceeded our expectations, obviously due to the launch, but sequentially the ASP in desktops if my math is right, looks like it was down quite a bit. Could you just talk about whatâs going on in the Mac business, how the new Macs are doing, what you think of your pipeline, but also whatâs going on with ASPs like â am I right that there was a mix down in the desktop area and just whatâs going on in particular with regard to the mix with this tough economy in maybe notebooks and desktops?",1
"The third component to discuss with you is our tax payments. We made about $1.3 billion in tax payments in the March quarter and there is a couple of things that were driving that. First of all, for the current fiscal year, so this year, fiscal â09, we make our first estimated tax payments in the March quarter for the current fiscal year and in fact, there are two that are due in the quarter.",1
"This year, the tax payments were higher than what we saw last year because A, we are making more money, and B, given the equity markets, the credit that the company gets from employee option and RSU gains are down. So, we paid more tax for that and then also, we prepaid some potential audit settlements that were accrued on the balance sheet, but we paid them on a cash basis this quarter for prior years and we trued up for fiscal â08 this quarter as well. So, all three of those things combine for $1.3 billion in tax payments this quarter and that was up significantly year-over-year.",1
"Okay. Thank you, Peter.",1
Youâre welcome.,1
"Thanks, Keith. Can we have the next question, please?",1
This will come from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.,1
"Okay. Hi Ben, itâs Tim.",1
"For us, itâs about doing great products. And when I look at what is being sold in the netbook space today, I see cramped keyboards, terrible software, junky hardware, very small screens, and just not a consumer experience, and not something that we would put the Mac brand on quite frankly. And so, itâs not a space as it exists today that we are interested in, nor do we believe that customers in the long term would be interested in. Itâs a segment we would choose not to play in.",1
Hi Tim.,1
"Across the quarter, as we got into March and announced a completely new desktop line, we saw an acceleration of sales and it was that acceleration that allowed us on a sell-through basis to approximately be equal to the year before. After we did the desktop launch, we began to ship a higher mix of desktops than we were before the transition and that helped to push the overall ASP down.",1
"Within the desktops themselves, the top end of the line, Mac Pro, we had a lower mix to the Mac Pro, a higher mix to the Mac mini than we had before the transition and really all throughout the quarter, the Pro products that are primarily being sold to the creative professionals, were weaker than they were in the year-ago quarter and we believe that thatâs mainly economic related, as you would guess, businesses are cutting back on technology expenditures.",1
"In addition, education in the U.S. contracted by about 11% year-over-year and this is a result of states not having the tax revenues as projected and we are hoping that as we get into this quarter that the stimulus funds that were approved last quarter begin to flow to the states and we see some benefit from that. But that remains to be seen. So, net-net, yes, ASP did decline, it was â desktops were a piece of it, but doing all the desktops in a single day, which was â itâs unprecedented for us to do that, really helped us drive more sales in March and get the Mac business to a much better level by the end of the quarter.",1
"In the notebook business, we did have an ASP decline sequentially and that was mainly driven by a higher mix to the $999 MacBook that we had announced partway through the quarter in the October â late October timeframe. I think thatâs actually a good thing, not a bad thing, because I think what you see is, for us anyway, the consumer is holding up much better than the professional, and much better than education. Education is gated by tax receipts and funding and the professional is really cutting back expenses and delaying â I donât think itâs business we are losing necessarily, but delaying purchases.",1
"Itâs no secret that the netbook is obviously doing pretty well. Do you have any thoughts there on that category now that youâve been able to watch it for a few quarters and what you are thinking and it has obviously held up the market a bit in the recent data and you donât have it, and you still outperformed the market? Just any thoughts on where you are and where you arenât that you might want to share?",1
"Yes, Bill, weâre not â we are not economist and so we are not entering the game of predicting bottoms and that sort of thing. We will report our results and give a view of the next quarter. But if you look at the different product areas, which is the way that we think about it, if you looked at the iPod linearity through the quarter and you overlaid last year, you would see very little difference in the two curves. We were up 3% year-over-year, and so very, very similar and not much to mention except for the point I made earlier that from a mix point of view, the iPod Touch is the runaway hit and itâs clearly being driven by the App Store that we spoke about earlier.",1
"On the Mac side, as I mentioned earlier, our sells, our unit sell through had accelerated in March after we turned every desktop in the company on the same day. And so March is a very important month for the Mac business. When you look at the iPhones, the iPhones linearity to the quarter, it was reasonably linear business after the first week or two; it was very little up and down in the aggregate. Obviously itâs a new business for us, itâs the first March quarter that weâve had rolled out to significant number of countries and so we were exceptionally pleased to see that instead of the normal seasonality curve that one would associate with most consumer electronics.",1
"Okay, very helpful. Thanks.",1
"Thanks Toni. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"Tim, could you also comment on your thinking about expanding iPhone adoption. Recently when â you have said that one area where you are spending a lot of time is thinking about how to increase the adoption of the iPhone and you have been thinking a lot about elasticity. One comment that it struck me was that you were surprised by from your research at the elasticity that you thought was associated with the price of the device. Can you update me on your thinking or what you have learned about iPhone elasticity, now a quarter or later?",1
"Well, yes, we had a very good quarter in the March quarter. With actually a very small sequential declines for holiday quarter which was far above what our expectations were, so weâre very pleased with how we did. We also announced 3.0 or previewed it developers so that they could begin to change their apps, introduce more apps for the phone, which we believe increases the ecosystem and increases the number of people that want and will buy phone itâs even more. And so weâre very focused on the products side. Weâre very focused on the App Store.",1
"There we are also focused on geographic rollouts. We spent time this quarter on the Middle East and Asia and rolled up Saudi Arabia, UAE, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand to name a few and weâre obviously focused on more in the future. And so between those the product plans that weâve got in the App Store and the software that you have seen and then things I canât talk about, we have a plan that we believe continues to make us the leader in the space, continues to keep us years ahead of others and one of the things that we will make sure is that we donât leave a price umbrella for people.",1
"And then finally I guess one for Peter, quickly in response to one of the other questions, you talked about considerations for margins in terms of forces that work to the degree that you can â can you help give us a bridge in terms of your thinking whether itâs qualitatively or quantitatively about how we think about 36.4% gross margins this quarter to 33% next quarter, can you rank order the forces, can you explain and then rank order the forces in terms of their impact on that expected deceleration?",1
"Yes on the â and I will say the larger two out of three are the stronger US dollar and seasonally lower mix driven largely by the beginning the education buying season. Let me talk about each of those. Regarding the dollar, the dollar is all but stronger today than where it was throughout most of the March quarter. But the â the bigger impact for us on a sequential basis regarding the dollar is our hedges.",1
"In our December and March quarter, we had the hedges in place that weâre put in place at the time that the dollar was not as strong and the hedges that we have in place for the June quarter largely we will put in place during March at stronger dollar levels and thatâs really what is the â is really the driving factor behind the sequential impact of the dollar. And of course the ed buying season begins in the June quarter and June tends to be more dominated by K-12s than High Eds. The September quarter historically is stronger for High Eds than for K-12. And K-12 being more of an institutional sale and we expect to be competitive this year especially given the funding situation that tend to strike.",1
Next comes from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.,1
"Thanks Bill. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"Great, thank you very much. I was wondering if you have any information on the percentage of customers that upgraded their iTunes music library now that youâve launched the DRM free feature. And if you can give us some idea what the revenue from that might have been.",1
"Dave, itâs just been a couple of weeks. So I think itâs â I think itâs sort of too soon to tell in and I donât have anything sort of specific on that. The March quarter was very strong for us on the iTunes Store. We saw very, very strong growth in music, video, and of course applications.",1
"And then did you say for the September quarter, the margins and gross margin might go down to around 30%, I was just wondering what the reasons you thought it might drop off again would be?",1
"Well I am not giving guidance for the September quarter at this point. But in answer to Billâs question, I said about 34 for the September quarter. Weâll â weâll give you more of our thoughts in July on the September quarter.",1
Thanks David. Could we have the next question please?,1
The next is Scott Craig with Banc of America.,1
"And what weâre about is making the best computers in the world, not making the most, and not getting to a point where we are building products that we are not building products that we are not proud of. And so that first and foremost is our objective and we believe that if we do that over the long-term that we will gain share. Weâre â I am not going to worry about the ebb and flow of each 90 days, because I think that leads you to make a lot of short-term decisions that are not good for the company or for the brand over time.",1
"And the second is that we saw a less pro Macintoshes being bought in the US on a relative basis to other geographies and we would attribute that also to the economy. There were some mix found there across the world thatâs much more so in the US where I think the professional markets have been hit much harder. And so do I care about US share, of course, I do. However, I think cycles come and cycles go.",1
"In the US, the US was our weakest, largest geography in terms of comparison year-over-year. But I would remind you that in our US business, a larger percentage of that business is education oriented and therefore subject to the budget constraints that have been significant in many, many other states, actually almost of the states. And so I think thatâs one reason why the US is disproportionately affected.",1
"On â Toni, itâs Tim. On a worldwide basis, just to make sure weâre in sync with the numbers, IDC projected a â that the market contracted by 7% worldwide. On a reported basis, we contracted by 3%, but as Peter said in his opening comments on a sell-through basis, we were essentially flat year-over-year.",1
"Yes, thank you. I wanted to revisit Mac question. Your Mac business was down 8% in the Americas, I presume that the US was potentially worst than that. According to Gartner, the US market was flat this quarter. Though you actually did lose material share and I think as you noted despite the fact that you had a new desktop line up that created a surge in your run rate at the end of the quarter. So I guess given that statement, one, do you care about your market share in the US? And second, given the movement in ASPs that you saw towards the lower end and given your share performance in the US, does that shape or change your thinking about Mac pricing in anyway?",1
"Thanks Gene. Could we have the next question, please?",1
We will look forward to Steve returning at the Apple at the end of June.,1
Any update regarding Steve Jobs and his return?,1
"Gene, what is your question?",1
Okay. And on Steve Jobs? I will let Peter make a comment there.,1
"On â okay, let me just comment on BRIC in general. We now have of the four BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India, and China, we have three of those up and we have 8,000 store counts in those three selling the iPhones and we feel very good about that and weâre putting a lot of energy in growing those. China, we are not in yet. We would like to be in China within the next year and are currently working on that. But I have got nothing specific to announce today on this.",1
Okay. And then I guess one more before the Steve Jobs question is any color on kind of the hole up as far as getting China up and rolling on the iPhone?,1
"Well from a technology point of view as you know, Verizon is on CDMA and weâve shown from the beginning of the iPhone to focus on one phone for the whole of the world and when you do that, you really go down the GSM root, because CDMA is â doesnât really have a life to it after a point in time.",1
Is there a structural reason why you need to maintain with AT&T from a technology perspective?,1
"On AT&T, Gene, we view AT&T as a very good partner. We believe that theyâre the best wireless provider in the US and we are very happy to be doing business with them. They have done a very good job with iPhone, theyâve put the full force and weight of their company behind it, itâs a major strategic thrust for them and so weâre very happy with the relationship that we have and do not have a plan to change it.",1
"Hi good afternoon. Congratulations. Iâve got a question on the iPod. Our survey board suggest the exclusive relationship with the AT&T is the number one reason why people donât purchase an iPhone and given the revenue shares no longer exist, can you walk us through some of your thinking in terms of why maintain an exclusive with AT&T. Just a follow-up question regarding any update on Steve Jobs? Thanks.",1
And it will come from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.,1
"First, as we talked about in the last quarterâs call, we did make our prepayment to LGD for $500 million [ph]. Second, youâd notice that our accounts payable was down from the December to March quarter by over $700 million. The decline in AP as we leave the holiday quarter and conclude the March quarter is very typical for us. So, there is nothing new there, but that does play into the sequential results.",1
"Hi, thanks. Peter, for you. Cash flow was actually down year-over-year. Itâs the first time going back for some period of time that Iâve seen cash flow from operations to be down on the year-over-year for the March quarter. Could you talk about a little bit of what was driving that and specifically, was there anything on the deferred revenue recognition â the deferred balance that changed consistent with the revenue recognition policies or the like thereof when you went to the new software platform?",1
"Thank you Mark. Thanks to everyone for joining us. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on Apple.com/Investor and by telephone. The numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820. Please enter the confirmation code 5473920. These replays should be available beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. PT today.",1
"I have a couple of questions; one is do you have any color that you can provide on the demographics of Macbook Air purchases? You know, I originally thought it would be for road warriors but the numbers suggest it is selling far better than that.",1
"No, Iâm just going to comment that in total, that we sold more than we expected. We expected a sharper seasonal decline than what we experienced and as you know, this was our first Q1 to Q2 that weâve been in the phone business, and so weâve learned something.",1
"And then staying with the phone, I know a couple of other people have asked but last quarter on this call, you said you werenât comfortable discussing the unlocked percentage because of the high concentration of phones that had been sold at the very end of December and the holiday season and that you felt youâd get a better read on that in January. Invariably you have gotten a better read on that, and so given that you had given out the number before, or an estimate of that number, why the reticence now give at least for last quarter you should have ample ability to be able to quantify that?",1
"We donât feel that we can quantify it with precision, and so we donât want to put out a number that we canât stand behind. But weâve gone out of our way to classify the number as significant. Iâm not sure how to be more clear than that.",1
"And then switching to Macs, your notebook ASP declined sequentially and year over year, given that you introduced the Macbook Pro which sounded like got off to a good start, and you also mentioned strength in Macbook pros. Were those both relatively small and were price cuts relatively big? Or how do we reconcile the ASP decline?",1
"The ASP decline was slight, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis and they were largely driven by the transition that we had in the quarter and some mix shifts within our Macbook and Macbook Pro lines. But again, they were small.",1
Weâll move to Charles Wolf with Needham & Company.,1
"And sort of in the same vein, do you have any sense of how many Window users purchased a Macbook Air?",1
"Once the units are already shipped and designated to a carrier, the ability to move them from carrier to carrier is very low. And so you can have very short-term cases where there is some imbalance. But I think the major point is that we sold more than we thought we would and that today, inventories are low and in aggregate in Europe and in aggregate in the U.S.",1
"We donât on the latter, Charlie. What we would share is that it is appealing to all sorts of people, from college professors to students to people that travel a lot. It seems to have universal appeal and also the cannibalization factor was extremely low to the other portables, which is one of the key reasons we were able to have a very minor sequential decline from Q1, where usually it would be much deeper.",1
"Thanks, Charlie and thanks to everyone for joining us. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone. And the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112, or 719-457-0820, and the confirmation code is 7414725. These replays will be available beginning at approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.",1
"Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896, and financial analysts can contact Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570 and I am at 408-974-5420. Thanks again.",1
That does conclude todayâs conference call. We do thank everyone for their participation.,1
Good day and welcome to this Apple Incorporated Apple Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2009 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.,1
"Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, and he will be joined by Apple's COO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&A session with analysts.",1
Can you comment on whether you thought you sold more in Europe than you thought you would?,1
"And at the very end of the quarter where you were having stock-outs in your own stores, was your channel inventory also low? Because it seemed like the phones were readily available in Europe and through AT&T stores, which obviously beg the question of why were you not able to better balance the allocation of phones, particularly towards the end of the quarter?",1
"Thanks, Rich. Can we have the next question, please?",1
"And just one follow-up; if I move over to the iPhone, when you look at the unlocked or non-activated phones in the prior quarter, some of that was gifts that were bought late in the holiday season. Have you seen any change in behavior from the carryover from that December quarter? Were they actually activated? Have you seen any significant changes?",1
Weâll move to Shaw Wu with American Technology.,1
I just had a question on your acquisition of PA Semi -- any comments or color you can give around that? Thanks.,1
"Shaw, we occasionally buy smaller technology companies from time to time and we donât have a practice of commenting on our purpose or plan, so I canât.",1
We have Jeff Fidacaro from Merrill Lynch.,1
"Peter, I was wondering if you could touch on the Mac side. When you take a look at PC unit growth, typically itâs down quarter over quarter in the calendar second quarter. Given your strength has accelerated to about three times the market growth, I wonder if you could highlight any comparable seasonality in the Mac business in your June quarter.",1
"What we generally see in June is a sequential increase in Mac shipments as the education buying season begins and the June quarter tends to be more heavily weighted to K-12, which buys typically at lower ASPs, and the September quarter tends to be more heavily weighted within the ED buying season by higher education.",1
"As Tim commented, itâs really hard to estimate precisely and we donât want to throw a number out. Unlocking is occurring and it is significant but our view is that this is -- itâs just a clear interest in demand globally for the iPhone and we think it -- we are hearing reports of iPhones being used in many countries and this is one of the things that gives us confidence in our goal of shipping 10 million in calendar 2008.",1
"I donât want to be specific at the carrier level but I the aggregate, Europe is low. In the aggregate, the U.S. is low.",1
Weâll move to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.,1
"Thank you. I was hoping you could reconcile your statement that iPhone demand was outstripping supply at the end of the quarter with what appears to be an excess supply in most European countries of the phone. You indicated that they can price as they want and we are seeing price cuts of over 50% on the phone, which certainly doesnât sound like a situation where they are under-supplied.",1
"Were you seeing a noticeably different demand profile in the U.S. relative to your expectations versus Europe? And if so, why couldnât you simply ship phones from what appears to be an overstocked Europe to the U.S. to fulfill that demand?",1
"Tony, my point was that stock-outs were occurring in our own stores toward the end of the quarter and we believe that was because our stores are more susceptible to people going in and buying multiple units and then unlocking and exporting them.",1
"However, I also added that currently inventories are low in both our stores and in the channel.",1
And is that also the case in your European channel or is that an aggregate channel statement?,1
"Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share, and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts.",1
"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2008, the Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter of 2009, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased to report the best non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings in our history. These results exceeded our expectations and we continue to be very pleased with our performance in this economy.",1
"We expect gross margins to be about 33%, reflecting approximately $30 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $1.35 billion including a $150 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $55 million, reflective of the short-term interest rate environment and we expect the tax rate to be about 31%. We are targeting EPS in the range of $0.95 to $1.",1
"We hosted 39.1 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 33.7 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 16%. We also hosted a record 644,000 personal training sessions during the quarter, an increase of 11% year-over-year. We remain on track to open a total of about 25 stores during fiscal 2009, about half of which we expect to be outside the U.S.",1
"Total company gross margin was 36.4%, which was 390 basis points better than our guidance. This difference was primarily driven by three factors. First, commodity and other hardware component costs were significantly lower than we planned. We have been very disciplined with our inventory management, which allowed us to take advantage of the continued favorable commodity market during the quarter. Second, sales of higher-margin products including software and accessories were better than planned. And third, we benefited from lower freight and warranty costs.",1
Operating expenses were $1.3 billion including $152 million in stock-based compensation expense. OpEx was $26 million below our guidance as we spent less in many areas of the company. OI&E was $63 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 30.3%.,1
"Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $28.9 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to $28.1 billion at the end of the December quarter. Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $841 million. Our investment priority for the cash continues to be preservation of capital, which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short-dated, high-quality investments and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio.",1
"Looking ahead to the June quarter, Iâd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We will continue our process of providing guidance based on GAAP and we will report our June quarter non-GAAP financial measures during July when we release our results.",1
"Forecasting in the current macroeconomic environment remains challenging. So, we will continue to provide a range of guidance for the June quarter. We expect revenue to be between $7.7 billion and $7.9 billion. This reflects not starting revenue recognition for iPhones sold on or after March 17th until the date of the iPhone OS 3.0 software is released.",1
"In closing, we are very pleased with our record March quarter results and how well Apple is performing in this economy. We are extremely enthusiastic about the launch of the iPhone OS 3.0 and canât wait to get it into customersâ hands this summer. We are also very excited about the other products in our pipeline. We remain confident in our strategy and are working hard to deliver the worldâs most innovative and extraordinary products.",1
"Revenue for the quarter was $8.16 billion, representing 9% growth over the prior March quarterâs results. Operating margin percentage for the quarter was one of our highest ever at 20.4%, primarily due to higher than anticipated revenue and gross margin. Net income was $1.2 billion, which translated to earnings per share of $1.33.",1
(Operator instructions) Your first question will come from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.,1
"All right. Thanks. Well, great job on the quarter and in the absence of too much else to pick on, I guess Iâll ask the standard component question of Tim, what is your outlook in terms of pricing and component supply going into the June quarter, please?",1
"Hi, Rich. March quarter, we believed that most of the excess inventory in the supply chain was consumed. And so, where we see the component environment still being favorable on an overall basis, it will be some commodities like NAND as an example, which will increase sequentially. NAND in particular has recently increased due to reduced wafer starts from several of the suppliers attempting to address the profitability issues. Other than that, I think last quarter was about wringing out excess inventory environment we continue to be favorable, but I donât expect to see the level of reductions that we experienced in calendar quarter one.",1
"But you do expect Tim, the aggregate building materials to be down sequentially in the June quarter?",1
I expect it to be within a similar range as last quarter.,1
"Okay. All right, thanks.",1
"Retail segment margin was $308 million compared to $334 million in the year-ago quarter. We believe that the year-over-year decline in average store sales and segment margin is a reflection of the continued weakness in the spending environment, coupled with third party channel expansions relative to the year-ago quarter.",1
"Iâd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. The stores recognized $1.47 billion of revenue during the March quarter compared to $1.45 billion in the year-ago quarter. Our stores sold 438,000 Macs, about half of which were to customers who have never owned a Mac before. We opened one new store during the quarter, bringing us to 252 stores. With an average of 251 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $5.9 million compared to $7.1 million in the year-ago quarter.",1
The revenue and cost of sales associated with these iPhones will be recognized ratably over the remaining terms of respective 24-month estimated lives. Revenue recognition for handset sales prior to March 17th is not affected by the announcement.,1
"Developers have responded very enthusiastically to the new SDK and we expect that customers will love the many new features of iPhone OS 3.0 and the new apps that will be available. Because we announced these specific new features and plan to provide iPhone customers to them as a free upgrade, we have delayed the start of revenue recognition for all iPhones sold on or after March 17th announcement date until the iPhone OS 3.0 software is released this summer.",1
"On March 17th, we provided developers with a preview of iPhone OS 3.0 and began the developer seeding process. The iPhone OS 3.0 release will include an updated software development kit with over a 1,000 new developer APIs, enabling in-app purchases, peer-to-peer connections, app control of accessories, and push notifications. The iPhone OS 3.0 release will also add over a 100 customer features including cut, copy, and paste, spotlight search, landscape keyboard and view for all key iPhone apps and MMS support.",1
"Turning to the iPhone, we were extremely pleased to have sold almost 3.8 million handsets in the March quarter, a 123% increase over the 1.7 million handsets sold in the year-ago quarter. We continue to expand iPhoneâs geographic reach during the quarter and are now selling this in 81 countries. Revenue recognized from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales, and carrier payments was $1.52 billion compared to $378 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of over 300%. The sales value of iPhones sold during the quarter was over $2.2 billion.",1
"We believe the App Store is a key strategic differentiator of the iPhone and iPod Touch experience and is more evidence of what we have always said, that software is a key ingredient for a great mobile experience. We continue to believe that we are years ahead of competition and we are very excited about the prospects of even more compelling apps as developers take advantage of the many new features that will enabled by the iPhone OS 3.0 this summer.",1
"The App Stores continues to be an unparallel success for developers and customers and now offers over 35,000 applications compared to the 15,000 available as of our last conference call. We are within hours of reaching our 1 billionth download, an astounding number given the number of â given the short nine-month history of the App Store.",1
"The iTunes Store delivered another great quarter, fueled by strong sales of music, video, and apps. We recently introduced a number of changes to the iTunes Store including the availability of DRM-free iTunes Plus titles from all four major labels, as well as thousands of independent artists.",1
"We saw healthy year-over-year iPod unit sales growth in a number of large markets including the U.K., France, Germany, Japan, Australia, and China. We began and ended the quarter within our target range of 46 weeks of iPod channel inventory.",1
"Customers and reviewers responded favorably to the March introduction of the all-new iPod Shuffle, the worldâs smallest music player, featuring a great new industrial design, voice-over technology, and convenient new earphone cord controls. We remain very pleased with iPod market share. Our share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% based on the latest monthly data, published by NPD, and we continue to gain share year-over-year in both international markets based on the latest data published by GFK.",1
"Now, Iâd like to discuss our music products and services. We sold over 11 million iPods, representing a new March quarter unit record and 3% growth over the year-ago quarter. We generated very strong year-over-year growth in sales of iPod Touch as customers continue to embrace the superior features of the platform, coupled with the rapidly growing array of applications available through the App Store.",1
We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory. We experienced strong sales with January releases of iLife â09 and iWork â09. We believe the outstanding features of iLife and iWork are among the very compelling reasons why customers are drawn to the Mac experience.,1
"Our Mac shipments in this yearâs March quarter compares favorably to the 7% year-over-year contraction in the market overall, based on the latest estimate for the quarter, published by IDC. We successfully transitioned the entire Mac desktop line in March and continue to see a strong year-over-year growth in MacBook shipments. Our overall units sell through of Macs was flat year-over-year and given the tough year-over-year comp and the challenging economic environment, we feel very positive about our Mac performance.",1
"Turning to the details of our results, Iâd like to begin with our Mac products and services. For the March quarter, we sold 2.22 million Macs compared to 2.29 million Macs in the year-ago quarter, a 3% decline. In the year-ago March quarter, Mac sales increased 51% year-over-year due in part to January 2008 launch of the MacBook Air, creating a very difficult compare.",1
We continue to believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide added transparency to our business and hope they are helpful to you in your analysis and understanding of our performance.,1
"In terms of non-GAAP measure, adjusted sales totaled $9.06 billion for the March quarter, which was $900 million higher than our reported revenue. Adjusted gross margin was $3.62 billion, which was $650 million higher than our reported gross margin, and adjusted net income was $1.66 billion, $450 million higher than our reported net income.",1
"Thanks, good afternoon. Just with regards to cash flow Peter, is there anything in the June quarter that you guys would consider sort of one-timish items that could impact like we saw this quarter? And then I have a follow up.",1
"Sure. Let me just kind of quickly go back through what occurred this quarter. So from March to the June quarter, I would not expect the holiday phenomena that we see each year of going from the holiday quarter to the March quarter and necessarily the impact on accounts payable.",1
"I donât have any preface to announce that weâre going to make in the June quarter, so we did make a $500 million repayment in March. And then related to the tax payments, we will make an estimated payment for fiscal â09 in the June quarter and then we will make one in the September quarter as well. But I donât expect to have any of the prior year audit true-ups or to make any more payments on fiscal â08, so I donât expect the tax payments to have the significance in the June quarter that they did in the March quarter.",1
Could you talk about the performance of your China stores in particular and your plans for additional store openings in China this year?,1
We have nothing to announce relative to those things today. I am just saying that we have a great product. We have seen great demand. We have priced this extremely aggressively and we did that because we believe there is a huge market for it and certainly the initial results suggest that is the case.,1
You talked about the headwinds on gross margin going into the second calendar quarter. In the spirit of balance I was hoping you might be able to talk about what you might consider tailwinds on gross margin going into June? In particular whether you would consider component pricing overall to be a headwind or a tailwind in the June quarter sequentially?,1
I donât really consider component pricing to be a headwind or a tailwind. Tim I think answered in Billâs question his view on what we were going to see in the June quarter. So [costs] are by themselves necessarily a big factor. I think what we think is going to occur in the June quarter is we have introduced a new product that we couldnât be more excited about. We have been very aggressive and we will take advantage of our first-mover opportunity here.,1
Then we have some other transitions. We have a stronger dollar and we are heading into the Ed buying season which we anticipate being competitive this year. So that is really what has gone into our thinking on gross margin.,1
I wanted to ask you about the accounting treatment for the iPad. Whether you could give us a sense of whether you are going to be deferring a portion of the revenue associated with iPad software upgrades or whether you are going to be charging for those upgrades?,1
We will discuss that with you on our July conference call when we report the June quarter results which will include our first shipments of iPad.,1
Sure. We are very excited about China not only for retail but for Apple. Tim talked about the success we have had in greater China to date with revenue being up about two timeâs year-over-year. With regard to retail stores we will open two stores in Shanghai this summer and with targets of having about 25 stores open in China by the end of calendar 2011.,1
"No, that is definitely our view.",1
"If I look at your iPhone units across your 151 operators it is roughly about 58,000 units per operator. Understanding some operators are smaller and others larger, can you talk about the dynamic there and how you drive those units up more materially on a per operator basis?",1
"The 58,000 to be honest with you is not a very meaningful number because the variance is from one particular carrier that does a few million to some that do very, very low numbers. So the average itself isnât very meaningful. The things we do to drive overall iPhone demand is focus on product innovation. That is software that hopefully you saw with the preview we gave with new iPhones that will be coming this summer is new hardware and new products. It is new distribution points. It is additional carriers and geographic expansion which we will continue to do. It is really all of those things and great marketing.",1
Apple has been a little bit more aggressive defending its patent portfolio against infringement. It doesnât look like we are really seeing an impact here to OpEx. I am curious how we should think about legal expenses relative to your operating expenses?,1
We have certainly factored into the guidance we have given you for the June quarter and results we have reported for March our legal and other expenses. Whatever we are incurring in that area is included.,1
The next question comes from the line of Brian Marshall â Broadpoint Amtech.,1
"I guess some of the iPhone upset I was expecting last quarter actually happened this quarter and based on my calculations your international carrier partners probably represented roughly 75% of the mix for iPhone shipments in the quarter. And taking that one step further I think there was roughly 100 basis points penetrated of that international carrier base, call it post-paid sub base of those total carriers, roughly half a billion units. The question is have you learned any lessons with regard to how the international markets have ramped up relative to what you have experienced in the U.S. over the past 2.5 years?",1
But the implication of writing down the costs would be unless you pass that on in the form of much lower prices your margins are going to get better. I gather that statement suggests to the degree you want to drive volume you are going to be open minded about price changes?,1
"Let me comment on the iPad margin first. As you know we donât give out specific margins for products but really refer to the company gross margin. That said I would point out when we priced iPad we priced it very aggressively in order to deliver tremendous value to our customers. We think the market size for the iPad is very large and we want to capitalize on our first mover advantage. As we have done in other products, although I am not forecasting it, you can see we have a good track record of writing down the costs per with value engineering and volume manufacturing or at least that has certainly been our experience with other products. Those are the things I would point out. Peter do you want to add something to that?",1
"Okay. And then just a follow up on the iPhone for Tim, perhaps, you guys started with Wal-Mart I think towards the end of December last quarter and your sales came in probably higher than most people thought. How much of an impact was Wal-Mart there and then what was the channel inventory in the iPhone as you exited the quarter? Thatâs it from me. Thanks.",1
We are putting our toes in the water but donât expect much from us this calendar year. We think we will learn a lot and build a foundation for the future.,1
"We are thrilled with the App store and customers are loving it. It has seen well over 4 billion downloads from the App store and have over 185,000 apps and now over 3,500 for the iPad alone. We have just begun shipping the iPad. Early in the first week we released some data about customer downloads related to the iPad. They are clearly loving it and I think it is a very strong part of the overall product offering to customers.",1
"Can you talk a little bit about your production capacity on the iPad side? Clearly you pushed out, because of demand in the U.S., you pushed out your international launch. How are you feeling about your ability to produce there? How quickly can you ramp up production? Are there any [gating] factors with any commodity components or anything like that?",1
"We have done very well versus our planned capacity. There is not a production problem. It is sort of a good kind of issue to have that the demand in the U.S. was much, much stronger than we predicted and so regrettably we had to push out the international launch to be able to launch the 3G unit in the U.S. and to get the WiFi units into the United States. We are adding capabilities. We will see where this thing goes but it has shocked us the level of demand at least initially. We will see what happens from here.",1
I may have missed it but I didnât hear you comment on component pricing in your gross margin outlook. Can you give us a sense of what you are seeing in terms of the component pricing trends and where you are seeing any signs of pressure or easing?,1
The DRAM market is constrained. We do expect higher pricing sequentially as a result of that. The bulk of the other commodities including the key commodities of [demand] and LCD and HD we see generally in-supply demand balance. Other components we expect to decline consistent with historical trends.,1
I know it is still early stage here or actually pre-stage but can you help us understand how we should think about the economics of the iAd business. Is it a potential profit center or are you looking at it as a break-even type of business like iTunes and the App Store?,1
Can you give us an update on where you think AT&T is with its network improvement plans and are you still comfortable that the performance of the network will be up to par this year?,1
Can you comment? The math I think is pretty self-evident. Can you comment on whether we should be thinking about this device as having dramatically lower margins than the company average or should we be thinking about this as something that has perhaps a bit more volume than many investors are thinking about?,1
"I think they continue to work very, very hard and we look forward to continued improvement. They clearly made big strides in some areas with some of the recent surveys have pointed out and I think it will continue.",1
You kind of alluded to the growth from new carriers versus existing carriers. I donât know if it might be possible for you to quantify how much of the year-over-year growth came from new carriers or what percentage of the units were contributed by carriers you did not have one year ago?,1
"We donât break it out at that level of detail. I would tell you both were very important to us. Both the additions and the existing carriers. You can look at the number of carriers we added which was eight as I had mentioned, and out of the 151 carriers at the country level it is a good number but not a significant number. Obviously the existing carriers performed very well in addition to the adds.",1
"Taking that one step further, can you update us on your thinking about incremental distribution for the iPhone? A couple of calls ago you talked about not really believing in exclusive distribution and really trying to broaden distribution as quickly as possible. I think on the last earnings call it almost seemed like you had softened that and said look there may be regions where we actually donât care to operate beyond one carrier at our choice. Can you update us on your thinking about incremental distribution? How important is it? Is it available to any carrier in any country? How are you thinking about pricing the device for incremental distribution?",1
"Let me see if I can word it like this. There are three main countries where iPhones have a contractual exclusive relationship. That is the United States, Germany and Spain. There are a few smaller countries where we have an exclusive or co-exclusive but those three are the ones that are the major markets. Over the past year we have moved a number of markets from exclusive to non-exclusive. In each case as we have done that we have seen our unit growth accelerate and our market share improve. But that doesnât mean we view that formula works in every single case. I would just sort of reiterate what I did last time that this is how we are learning so far. That is the result we have seen so far. We think very carefully about each of these at the country level to conclude what is in our best interest.",1
"Let me just switch to one other topic if I may and Peter I think this is probably for you. Bear with me, I am going to just plug through some numbers. You said gross margin is going to decline 600 basis points sequentially in the quarter that would be due to the iPad. So that is 150 basis point negative impact from the iPad. If you assume the iPad is 10 points lower gross margin than the company average which is way, way lower than most third-party tear-down services which it would suggest it basically means for that contribution to be true for your guidance iPad would need to be 15% of your revenue or $2 billion. So either iPad is going to be more than $2 billion in terms of revenue per your guidance for next quarter and have a gross margin that is less than 10 points less than the company average or the gross margins of the iPad are more than 10 points lower than the company average.",1
I think the key thing is the smart phone category specifically is a great market to be in. It has very high growth rates from a market point of view and Apple with the iPhone unit growth of 131% outgrew the market by three times. So we feel great about that. Those numbers were even better outside of the U.S. than inside the U.S. We have learned a number of things and we are trying every day to take everything we have learned and do something better from a product point of view and do something better for distribution and our carrier relationships and so on and so forth. I donât want to go into each of those on here because I donât want anybody to copy those.,1
With regard to the Apple TV clearly it seems as though you have been very successful attracting additional media content on the iTunes and the App Store platform. I was wondering if we could get an update on ambitions with regard to Apple TV? Clearly broadband is still somewhat lagging in terms of quality of the service I think and cell phone areas need to get better. I wanted to get your thoughts there.,1
"The units were up for the quarter 34% year-over-year but the absolute number of units are still small and we still classify the product as a hobby for the company. I would just repeat what I have probably said before. If you look at the other markets that Apple is in, the Macintosh competes in a market of 300 million or so units a year. The iPhone competes in a market if you look at all phones of maybe 1.2 billion a year. The iPod competes in a market that has 100 million plus or minus units per year.",1
You mentioned $600 ASP for the iPhone. Does that include the ratable revenue from software or is that purely for the hardware?,1
"Sure. We are going to report the iPad very similar as we do iPhones. It will be a line item on our data summary and the revenue we report will be for the iPad units and the iPad specific accessories. Again, similar to what we do for iPhones.",1
The next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner â Oppenheimer.,1
Recognizing the iPad is still in very much in early days but have you been able to pick out anything about the apps performing? Are consumers buying different kinds of apps than they typically have for the iPhone and is the ASP panning out to be different than the types of apps people bought for the phone to this point?,1
"It is very early days. We put out some information after the first couple of days. Customers are loving the iPad. They are going to the App Store and getting apps, getting books. It has been really a great thing for customers but we will talk more in the future about how that goes. I would say we are not focused on trying to make a lot of money on the App Store as we havenât on the iTunes store. We have run the store just over break-even and we just want to offer tremendous value to customers.",1
Europe appears to be performing exceptionally well. Can we finally say you are seeing a halo effect from the iPhone there? To what extent has that been playing out at the stores? Are more than 50% of Mac buyers in European stores new to Mac?,1
We tend to not break it down by country but I can tell you we are thrilled with our new to Mac all over the world.,1
"It is based on the sales value of the iPhone so it doesnât include anything from carrier payments, any of the deferral or accessories. So it is the sales value in the quarter of the handset sales.",1
"So these are enormous sized markets and clearly the market that AppleTV is in is not in our view nearly that large as yet. That is the reason we classify it as a hobby so that no one gets the wrong impression that we have a vision that it is anywhere close to the size of the other businesses. However, a number of us love the product, use the product and we continue to think there is something is something interesting there and we continue to invest in it.",1
Earlier you mentioned that Apple was shocked about the reception in the U.S. for the iPad. Can you talk about how you are shocked in terms of customer penetration? Are there any customers in the early days that are taking the iPad that are completely new to Apple?,1
Of course. The numbers right now are so preliminary and based on such a small amount of time we donât read a lot into those. So they are not something we would disclose at this point.,1
Not too far beyond the iPad but in the prepared release you said there are other extraordinary products in the pipeline for this year. Are those incremental categories similar to the iPad or are they just enhancements of existing products?,1
We are just not going to help our competitors so that is not a question I can specifically answer for you. Let me reiterate we are very confident in our new product pipeline and are very excited about the coming months.,1
"In terms of the education vertical as far as the commentary around the margin hit for June, how much of that is driven by competitive dynamics versus maybe just your own ability here to try to cough up demand because of the troubles facing some of the school districts out there?",1
"You read the same things we do about the state budget situations and the school districts are under a lot of pressure in pretty much every state around the country. I have seen no evidence we are losing market share in education and so I think it is really just a budget issue. We have now entered in the June quarter the education buying season. June tends to be more dominated by K-12 and then September will be more dominated typically by higher ed. This year we expect it to be competitive but we are going to put on our uniforms, suit up and we look forward to competing.",1
I wanted to ask one follow-up if I could. I know Rich had asked about the iPad. Could you at least let us know where that will be categorized as a line item? Will it be independent or included in something else?,1
"Again, the average store was up 8% and in the quarter our average revenue was $5.9 million. So if you annualize it that is incredibly high by retail standards particularly for the size of store we have. I would say good growth coming not only from new stores that we open but the stores that we have had open for a number of years are performing very, very well for us and cash flow from those stores is quite strong.",1
Right but the data has been fairly consistent that the revenue growth in retail at least that category is dependent upon new store openings.,1
"Sure. Our retail stores had a great March quarter. The average increase of revenue per store was actually up 8% and this was the best we had seen in six quarters. The Mac did incredibly well in the stores, up 38% overall. Same store Mac sales were up over 20%. Phone did well. I think the stores are really going to be a great place for customers to come in, look at and buy iPads. We are very confident in our retail stores. The experience it is giving customers and finally just after 10 years of retailing we are just ecstatic about the fact that roughly half of the Mac sales that occur each quarter are to people that have never owned a Mac before.",1
"I wanted to ask about retail. In your same store sales comments I think retail on same store sales were up about 7% and total retail was up about 22% in terms of revenue. Therefore, as investors look out is the retail number really driven by new store openings or is there something unusual that was going on? If you could give a little bit of color of the drivers of the retail business that would be great.",1
"The accessory portfolio is good for us. Over 5,000 accessories that work for the iPhone and iPod largely work for the iPad. We have come out with some great accessories for the iPad in the first weeks and the developer community has rallied around it as well. Letâs give it a little time and presumably some great things will happen there just like it has for iPhone and iPod.",1
"As a follow-up on the discussion around margin for iPad, either one of the upside drivers of revenue and margin for the iPhone has been the aftermarket sale of things like accessories. What have you considered about attach rates to the iPad relative to what you have seen on iPod and iPhone and could that maybe be an upside driver to gross margins for that portfolio over time?",1
"We do everything we can to try to get the best deal possible for the consumer. By the way I feel like each of the carrier partners we have worked want to do the same. I think everybody is focused on that. When we dropped the subsidized price of the phone to $99 last year we were actually surprised that the mix to the 3G was very, very high. As you know, that was at $199. I think it is important. I think that price is important on the device but I think there are other things people really want like an extremely innovative product and all the apps and the ecosystem and the great OS and incredible hardware we have got. I think it is one of the factors.",1
In a previous question you walked through some of the incremental demand drivers for the iPhone. The one you left out was price because Apple along with the carriers has done a good job lowering the price of the hardware over the last couple of years. But with the low end at $99 it seems the incremental demand from here would come from more affordable monthly service plans. So I guess my question is whether Apple has any influence via the carriers to get more aggressive on the total cost of ownership for the iPhone?,1
"I think it is a new category and certainly it is early but we really, really like what we see right now. We had what we thought were high hopes and it exceeded those. That is all I can offer for now. I would love to talk to you in July and tell you how the quarter went for the June quarter.",1
I think we did extremely well as usually in positioning the product in the January announcement when he talked about if a product category were to exist between the notebook and Smart Phone then it would need to do something better than either of those. I am just saying from my personal use there is a variety of things I would put on that list and I love notebooks personally but I would put email on it. I would put browsing on it. Listening to music. Watching videos. Watching TV shows of any type. Reading books. The list goes on. Of course you have the entire App store and the ecosystem built around that and so people that like to play games now they have that larger handbook to play games on and other apps from serious apps to less serious apps the larger handbook provides the artist a lot more room to do things that are very cool.,1
"You talked about you see it as a huge independent category and given all the public debate over its positioning which you obviously have some strong views on can you elaborate on why it you see it as a huge independent category given it is a new market, you just sort of listed off a lot of markets that are pre-existing. But you stated in this case you also feel [inaudible]. Why do you think Appleâs approach will outpace of that of big competitor tablets or vertical devices like ebooks?",1
"In terms of the iPad competing for customers who are considering a netbook, you know I am the wrong person to ask that. To be it is a no-brainer. iPad/Netbook, it is sort of 100 to zero. I canât think of a single thing the netbook does well. iPad does so many things very, very well. I am already personally addicted to mine and couldnât live without it. So I am probably not the right person to ask that question.",1
"I can only tell you in the quarter we finished, Q2 we finished in March, although we announced the iPad in January there was nothing obvious in the iPod number or the Mac number to suggest cannibalization. There is an obvious announcing and people know it is coming and it is starting to sell. So that part of the equation we donât know yet. We will find out. We are thrilled with how the iPad is selling and the enormous response that we have received. We also announced net MacBook Pro that you probably saw last week and the whole line change. So we are also happy about how the Mac business is positioned and the level of product innovation in those notebooks. It is enormous. It is taking battery life up to 10 hours. That is absolutely amazing.",1
"Just wondering why you didnât see, or whether you expect any touch cannibalization from the iPad and what is your sense for do you think iPad is cannibalizing maybe competitive netbooks?",1
"I think I commented on a prior question, at this point we are putting our toes in the water so we donât expect much this calendar year. We think we are going to learn a lot and we will work to build a foundation for the future.",1
A final question with regard to the iAds. Do you think this could be a significant source of potential incremental earnings down the road as I think what you offer advertisers is a pretty compelling demographic user base with the information and emotion you are able to convey?,1
Could you talk a little bit about data points for the success of the App store? And how you are thinking about the App Store with the addition of the higher ASP apps related to the iPad?,1
"China has been interesting. If you look at greater China which we define as mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, the iPhone units were up year-over-year over 9 times. We added another 800 points of distribution in China. The revenue, we have never released this number before but I will do this in this particular case, through the first half of the fiscal year that we just completed for the six month period our revenue from greater China was almost $1.3 billion and this is up over 200% year-over-year. So we are well pleased with how the company is positioned to take advantage of the growth in greater China.",1
Did China meet your expectations?,1
Thanks very much. Your gross margin guidance seemed to â seems to imply that you expect an unreasonably strong education selling season at least in terms of mix. Was that in consideration and combined with the desktop refresh? Can you help us understand why you expect about a 4.5% sequential revenue decline into the June quarter at its midpoint?,1
Whatâs the â whatâs the timing on construction of the new headquarters? Any update there?,1
"No, no update. Things are quite busy here. And well we will begin to focus on that in the future, but no updates today.",1
Weâre spending all of our energy on constructing new products.,1
Thatâs a good choice.,1
"Thank you. Could we have the next question, please?",1
We will hear from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.,1
"Sure. As we were putting our guidance for the June quarter together, a couple of things. First of all, last year in a much better economy, our Q3 revenue was down 1% sequentially. This year our guidance provides for a couple of more points of â of sequential decline. Now however it is important to point out that we are guiding for year-over-year growth on a GAAP basis and we would expect our adjusted sales growth to be even higher.",1
These replays will be available beginning at approximately 5 PM Pacific Time today. Members of the press with additional questions can contact Steve Dowling at 408-974-1896. And financial analysts can contact either Joan Hoover or me with additional questions. Joan is at 408-974-4570 and I am at 408-974-5420. And thanks again for joining us,1
"But as we think about this year, first, the economy and its continuing impact on consumers and business and the education buying season which we begins this quarter, I discussed earlier that the June quarter is more dominated by K-12 thatâs an institution sale and we expect things to be competitive this year given the economy and the funding situations. And we expect some reductions in ASP sequentially as we usually experience in the June quarter.",1
"Second, we will not begin to recording revenue on new iPhone sold since our March 17th event. And we will start that when we release the iPhone OS 3.0 software this summer. And finally, I talked a bit about in some of the gross margin discussion the currency environment and we expect the dollars to have an impact not only on gross margin, but of course on our revenue as well largely related to where we got the quarter hedged and the current spot rates.",1
What impact is like software to have on mix in the June quarter?,1
"We donât give specific product guidance. But in the March quarter, iLife and iWork sales exceeded our expectations and weâre one of the reasons why both revenue and gross margin was higher than we expected.",1
"Okay. Final question from me is around protecting your IP. Last quarter you talked about rigorously impacting your intellectual property. We havenât seen any action in the past 90 days, does that say something about either number one, your position, your patent position or number two, the product actually need to ship before you can take action on the IP side? Thanks.",1
"We think that Appleâs innovation in the iPhone as I said before is leading the industry by years. And we think competition is great, we think it makes all of us better as long as other companies invent their own stock.",1
"Well let me begin by saying for all the right reasons, we are making â we are working hard to try and be sure that your prediction of entry of cash does occur. But no, nothing new to announce to you today and we continue to be careful with how weâre investing cash and weâre very focused on principal preservations.",1
"Okay, great. And then Peter, we saw your comments on the tape earlier about use of cash, but I figured I would ask the question anyway. Any thoughts on the cash balance, obviously it was not up as much this quarter, but it sounds like given some of the uses of cash. But obviously going forward, there is substantial cash generation. So any thoughts there?",1
"I think it is difficult to comment on products that arenât shipping and so I â there is nothing intelligent I could say on the pre. The iPhone has now sold over 21 million and has the highest overall customer satisfaction of the new order shipping. And so we think that we are in a great position and with the combination of the App Store and affiliates download that should occur tomorrow, we think that we are years ahead. We very much look at this business or see it through the software platform lens and I think that has â that has benefited us and our customers very well. The breadth of Apps on the store mind boggling from everything from fun things as games to very serious medical kind of applications. And so the power of the device and the ecosystem is enormous and I think we are just scratching the surface now on its opportunity.",1
"Thank you, good afternoon. Tim, can you talk a little bit about what youâre seeing in terms of the competitive landscape for smartphones especially as we move closer to the launches of Palm Tree and as well as obviously the iPhone 3.0? And then I have a follow up.",1
"From Cross Research, you will hear from Shannon Cross.",1
"Thanks Charlie. Could we have the next question, please?",1
"Charlie, I would have to say that hitting a billion downloads in about 9 months is every exciting. I think customers are having a lot of fun. I think all of the genres are pretty popular. But of course games and you can see those by the top apps list are a quite popular. And I think thatâs one of the reasons why the iPod Touch is an example who has been such a success.",1
Are there any kind of unusual patterns in application sales by title versus music sales by title?,1
"Charlie, we are doing a number of things. We include easy to find top 50 and 100 Apps, both paid for and free. Weâve got them associated in various genres as well and weâre expanding those. And so I think the team has done a fantastic job making Apps easy to discover and fun to discover.",1
"Yes. In view of the explosion in the number of applications for the iPhone and the iTouch, I was wondering what steps Apple is taking to ensure that the iPhone Apps can be discovered? And are these any different from music discovery on the iTunes Store?",1
We will hear from Charles Wolf with Needham.,1
Thanks Scott. Could we have the next question please?,1
Okay thank you.,1
"So on your specific question, Iâm not going to talk about weeks, because we donât frankly have the experience headed into this quarter about the seasonality given this will be our first June quarter with a â with a sort of a worldwide spread. But we sold the channel inventory in the countries that we were in at the beginning of the December quarter fall by the end of the quarter. But with the countries that we added which I mentioned before, we added a net of around 80,000 units and so we ended at 1.83 million units. And again that includes all of those categories that I had mentioned earlier. Net-net, weâre very comfortable with the inventory and we have people running more of it.",1
"For example, we count demos that arenât sellable in inventory and we have about 100,000 of these 50,000 locations. We count units that are in transit from our factories to the carriers that are not physically available for sale and at the end of a quarter, at the end of the last quarter in particular that was around 100,000 units. So just to put your perspective â to put some context and perspective on now, we also in many cases count inventory all the way to the storefront. I think there are many people in the industry that that count units as sell through and seize to count channel inventory beyond the distribution center, itâs just not the way we look at it. We like to be very disciplined in this environment.",1
"In terms of total distribution across the world, we are selling iPhone now in over 50,000 storefronts in the 81 countries, so we have a sizeable presence and sizeable channel in the space. In terms of channel inventory, if you remember last time â last quarter, I told you that or implied that we had about 1.75 million units in inventory and to remind you in case you guys have forgotten, we are very conservative as to how we count inventory.",1
"In terms of Wal-Mart, and as you probably know, theyâre a very key partner for us, relative to iPod and we did expand through them for iPhone coverage and we believe they do provide us extended reach in areas that we werenât heading before. And weâre pleased with the results there thus far, but itâs in the early going and so there is not much to report there yet.",1
"Okay, thanks Chris. A replay of todayâs call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store. There is a webcast on apple.com/investor and by telephone. The numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and the confirmation code is 6117348.",1
"Welcome to the Apple Incorporated second quarter fiscal year 2010 earnings release conference call. Todayâs call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, maâam.",1
For example Vodafone in the U.K. and Ireland as well as some other carriers in key countries in Asia. We also had very strong performance from existing carrier partners really around the world. It was widespread and just generally terrific results.,1
On the mix between 3G versus WiFi any sort of flavor you can give us on how to model that out.,1
We expect OpEx to be about $1.83 billion including $185 million related to stock based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $45 million reflective of the short-term interest rate environment and we expect the tax rate to be about 27%. We are targeting EPS in a range of $2.28 to $2.39 compared to $2.01 in the year-ago quarter.,1
"In closing, we are thrilled with our record March quarter results and the momentum of our business. We are very pleased with the market share gains for our iPhone, Mac and iPod products and with the tremendous customer response to iPad. We are looking forward to the release of both iPad versions in nine international countries at the end of May and we are very enthusiastic about iPhone OS4 arriving this summer. We are very confident in our new product pipeline and are excited about the months ahead.",1
"It is clear the iPad is off to a fast start. Based on our work it looks like it has the potential to become the Mac of the masses, if you will. My question is what insight did you gain in the last three weeks in the U.S. market in terms of gauging what the impact of the iPad has been on the demand for the overall Mac and has there been any cannibalization? I would guess there is some data somewhere that would give us some insight into answering that question.",1
If you look at last quarter we made the announcement as you know of the iPad in January. In our view the last quarter there was no obvious impact on either the Mac or the iPod but you can look at the numbers we are reporting and judge that for yourself. Going forward now that we are selling into April we really donât have enough experience to come to a judgment yet. We will see how it goes. We are obviously thrilled with the sales of the iPad. They have far exceeded our expectations and it has been a relative great start.,1
Throughout the March quarter if you were to look on a month-to-month basis based on some of the third-party data we saw a deceleration in the growth rate of Mac in the month of March. Do you think any of that could have been attributed to people holding off on buying a Mac for an iPad and what would you attribute that step down in the month of March to?,1
"If you look at the previous March, the base quarter you are comparing to, we announced a new iMac and a new Mac Mini. So our compare point was to a month we announced two new products versus a month we didnât announce any new Macs. I wouldnât think you could really judge the Mac business on a month-by-month basis. I think looking at a longer period of time is correct. Certainly, our internal expectation was that the comparable would come down through the quarters and begin to comp against those products.",1
Honestly it is too early to tell. We have only been selling WiFi other than the pre-orders and we feel we really need to be selling both models side by side in an unconstrained environment before we are able really to know what the mix will be.,1
"Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2009 as amended, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.",1
I wonder if you could talk about your guidance and a follow-up. You talked about the many margin hits sequentially. Can you talk about revenue? For example you have the iPad which you have never had before which should help sequentially. Usually Mac is up in the June quarter sequentially and obviously the iPod are usually maybe down a little. Can you talk about the puts and takes sequentially? Is there something going on with the iPhone where there is a transition that hits that sequentially and that is why you are guiding down revenue sequentially?,1
"We are thrilled with the performance of our business and to be providing guidance year-over-year for growth of 34-38% for the June quarter. In coming up with that we factored several points into the guidance including sequentially lower ASPs from the beginning of the education buying season, a stronger U.S. dollar and product transition. We have also factored in sequentially lower iTunes which is typical as holiday gift cards are used in the March quarter and also sequentially lower accessory and software sales. For Mac we would expect to see a sequential increase in Mac unit sales as a result of the beginning of the education buying season and a recent refresh we just did in the Mac Pro line.",1
For iPod our in-stock in the March quarter was better than last year which helped us achieve the 10.9 million units. This year we would expect to see a bigger sequential decline in the June quarter than the 7% we saw last year. For iPhone we donât have much experience with seasonality with our current country and carrier distribution. We are very confident in our product but we will see what occurs and we will report to you in July. For iPad we are thrilled with customer response to the iPad and we will begin shipping both the WiFi and WiFi 3G versions in the U.S. by the end of April and 9 additional countries by the end of May.,1
"We feel very, very good about the start of iPad.",1
"I wanted to hear more about iPhones. Why was it so good? The number was actually frankly staggering due to the expectations in my opinion. There seems to be good strength overseas. Can you talk about why, what happened there and how was China and also channel inventory?",1
That is a lot. On the channel inventory our channel inventory was essentially flat from the beginning of this quarter compared to the end of the quarter. If you look in terms of geography we had some staggering growth rates as you mentioned. If you look at Asia Pacific as an example the iPhone units in Asia Pacific grew 474% year-over-year. Japan grew 183%. Europe grew 133% and so these are some fabulous numbers we are seeing just incredible demand for iPhones. Some of this was led by adding eight carriers in some key countries.,1
"As we said in January when we announced the iPad we have been very aggressive with pricing and are delivering tremendous value to customers. We think the market for the iPad will be large and we want to capitalize on our first-mover advantage. We expect the remaining three quarters of the margin decline to be due to four factors of roughly equal impact including; a stronger U.S. dollar, our Mac portable transition, the beginning of the education buying season and future product transitions.",1
Looking ahead to the June quarter I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between about $13-13.4 billion compared to $9.7 billion in the June quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 36% down from 41.7% in the March quarter and reflecting approximately $36 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect about 25% of the sequential gross margin decline to be driven by the first quarter of iPad sales.,1
"Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $41.7 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to $39.8 billion at the end of the December quarter, an increase of $1.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was over $2.3 billion. Our investment priorities for cash continues to be preservation of capital which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short-dated, high quality investments and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio.",1
Operating expenses were $1.65 billion and included $194 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&E was $50 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 24%. We have previously forecasted a 29% tax rate for the full-year but have revised our forecast to about 27% based on a higher mix of foreign earnings. The 24% tax rate for the March quarter was required to true up year-to-date provisions to 27%.,1
"Total company gross margin was 41.7% which was 270 basis points above our guidance. This difference was primarily driven by several categories of positive factors compared to our forecast. In order of relative impact these were; first, a stronger product mix including more iPhones and accessories. Second, lower cost. Third, fixed cost leverage from the higher than expected revenue in the March quarter as well as a few other small items.",1
"Retail segment margin was $373 million or 22.2% compared to $317 million or 23% in the year-ago quarter. We hosted 47 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 39.1 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 20%. We also conducted over 700,000 personal training sessions and we ended the quarter with 607,000 members in our One to One program. We remain on track to open 40-50 new stores in total during fiscal 2010 with over half being in international locations including London, Paris and Shanghai.",1
"I would now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. Revenue in the quarter was $1.68 billion compared to $1.38 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 22%. Our stores sold 606,000 Macs compared to 438,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 38%. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the March quarter were to customers who have never owned a Mac before. We opened two new stores in the U.K. during the quarter as well as a new store in Germany to end with 286 stores. With an average of 284 stores open during the March quarter average revenue per store was $5.9 million compared to $5.5 million in the year-ago quarter.",1
"Turning to the iPad we are extremely pleased with sales results during the past couple of weeks and the critical reviews and customer feedback has been outstanding. Customers are loving the iPad and its revolutionary multi-touch user interface that lets them browse the web, read and send email, enjoy and share photos, watch HD videos, listen to music, play games, read eBooks and much more. We are on track to begin shipping the 3G version of the iPad in the U.S. on April 30th and to begin shipping both versions of the iPad in nine additional countries at the end of May.",1
"We are also very excited about the release of the iPhone OS4 this summer. Developer response to the beta release and new SDK has been very positive and we believe customers and developers will really enjoy the over 100 new features including multitasking for third-party apps, folders, enhanced enterprise support, the iAd mobile advertising programs and much more.",1
"We have continued to expand iPhoneâs reach by adding both carriers and countries and we now have iPhone distribution with 151 carriers in 88 countries. We experienced very strong year-over-year growth in each of our geographic segments and particularly in Asia, Australia, Japan and Europe. We were very pleased with the significant sales growth in both existing and new carrier partners. We were also very pleased that customers once again ranked iPhone first in JD Power and Associatesâ 2010 U.S. Wireless Smart Phone Customer Satisfaction study.",1
"I would now like to turn to the iPhone. We are thrilled to have sold 8.75 million iPhones during the quarter, an all-time high exceeding the previous record set in the most recent holiday quarter. This represents 131% year-over-year growth over the previous March quarterâs results and is more than three times the IDCs published estimate of 41% growth for the Smart Phone market overall in the March quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales and carrier payments was $5.45 billion during the quarter compared to $2.43 billion in the year-ago quarter. The sales value of iPhones alone was about $5.3 billion and dividing this by the 8.75 million units yields an ASP of about $600.",1
"The iTunes store delivered its best quarter ever with sales of $1.1 billion due to continued strong demand for music, video and apps. iTunes has the worldâs largest online music catalog with a selection of over 12 million songs and in February we crossed the 10 billion mark for songs purchased and downloaded. The App Store continues to be a phenomenal success with more than 185,000 apps and well over 4 billion downloads to date by iPhone and iPod Touch users in 90 countries. We are very excited to have launched the iBook store as well as over 3,500 new apps designed for iPad. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4-6 weeks of iPod channel inventory.",1
"Moving onto our music products we sold 10.9 million iPods, about equal to the 11 million we sold in the year-ago quarter. iPod Touch continued to be very strong with units growing 63% year-over-year. The strong mix of iPod Touch resulted in overall iPod revenue growth of 12%, the strongest iPod revenue growth rate in the last two years. Our share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD. iPod was also the top selling MP3 player and continues to gain share internationally year-over-year in nearly every country we track including high market share countries such as Australia, the U.K., Canada and Japan based on the latest data published by GFK.",1
"We made our portable lineup even stronger last week by introducing an updated MacBook Pro line with faster processors, more powerful next generation NVIDIA graphics and even longer battery life. We began and ended the quarter with between 3-4 weeks of Mac channel inventory.",1
"Turning to the details of our results I would like to begin with our Mac products and services. We generated record March quarter sales of 2.94 million Macs. This represents 33% year-over-year growth compared to IDCs latest published estimate of 24% growth for the market overall in the March quarter. We were very pleased with Mac sales growth in each of our geographic segments and we experienced strong, double digit growth for both desktop and portable categories.",1
"Revenue was $13.5 billion, a 49% increase over the prior March quarterâs results. This very strong performance was due primarily to the more than doubling of iPhone sales and the strong momentum of our Mac products. This resulted in a much smaller sequential revenue decline from the December to March quarters than we normally experience. Operating margin was $4 billion representing 29.5% of revenue. Net income was $3.1 billion up 90% over the year-ago quarter and earnings per share were $3.33.",1
"Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are thrilled to report outstanding March quarter results that exceeded our expectations. The strong momentum we experienced in the holiday quarter continued in the March quarter. As a result, we are reporting our best non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings ever, the highest quarterly iPhone sales ever and a new record for Mac sales in the March quarter. We are delivering the best products in Appleâs history and our customers are responding enthusiastically.",1
This concludes todayâs conference. We appreciate your participation.,1
